As only the popular students were invited to attend.\u00a0\u00a0My little group of misfits were the school outcasts the more popular students, staff and teachers often picked on or made fun of. I'm glad we never had to go through the pain I sometimes saw other students arriving at school on a Monday morning, limping and grimacing from a beating they'd received over the weekend during one of their social gatherings. I'm just wondering if the victim in this was a willing partner, at least at the beginning, or if he was the victim of a surprised attack? If he was a willing partner, then he is in part culpable too. And if he was a willing partner I hope parents all over will warn their children the dangers of hazing. Some parents who were hazed themselves and survived it actually feel hazing is some kind of rights of passage to be expected just to belong to a tradition that's being going on for decades. They figure they survived it so to them it's no big deal until a tragedy like this strikes. Prayers to the family who lost their son in this senseless act, and also prayers to the accused who weren't taught any better. I can't help but feel this was in some part condoned at some higher level. Even if the condoning was off the record and the higher ups chose to look the other way. </p>", "id": "516989866", "createdAt": "2012-05-02T19:58:58", "points": 3}
