No, my father in law and my brother in law were both vets who needed the VA.  There was trouble with the va before W
Lincoln would not have signed the emancipation declaration if the South had been winning the war.  Look it up.  It would have been non issue with him.  He didn't own slaves but he didn't much care if anyone else did.  His views make for interesting and eye opening reading.  I am not sure the South's debts were forgiven either.
but O knew of the va problems before he was prez...he was on the VA  committee when he was a senator...
806,000 people stopped looking for a job LAST month...who knows how many have just given up and quit looking during this President's terms in office.  The labor participation force is now at 62.8....lower than it has been since the late 1970's.  Some articles say if you figure in population growth the % of the  American workforce is unchanged since 2008.  I don't think this Prez is doing anything to foster high paying, attractive jobs.
I did check the data...inflation was 14.8 and interest rates were 18%.  There was also the savings and loan failure...
Because he has never had the good of the American people, the American Military or the American Economy at the heart of his proposals.  Spending  money on failed bailouts, spending money on energy companies gone bankrupt spending money on a failed computer program built by one of his minions to provide easy access to a health care program he has had to delay or  by executive order amend and it still isn't being rolled out in all states but the mandates are still applicable.  Then of course there is Fast and Furious, IRS, NSA, Benghazi, VA....I know I missed something....but there is just too much to remember......except of course all of the above is Bush's fault.  I don't care about the color of a person's skin, but I do care about his ability to lead....BTW, Mr. O is as white as he is black and was raised by affulent White Grandparents....least we all forget.
and the Democrats.....
and most can still work. Go to it. hurrrah or what ever the feel good saying is.
We don't give a flying f**k for: veterans, needy, impaired, minorities, etc... Hitler had an idea called the "ultimate solution." Here we use "institutionalized apathy."
I voted for the guy twice.
But he can't hit fast-balls.
He's judicious when executive action is called for.
And I started by saying that I voted for him twice 'cause he was better by far than the other guy.
Just still not good enough!
Typical response - deny and excuse the House Republicans who were elected and are paid to do Nothing!  As long as they "stand up" to that Uppity President...you'll continue to support and elect them to office!  They don't have to actually govern, or devise any workable sensible legislation - just oppose the Prez...and that's good enough for you!  No, the stupidity and obstructionist behaviors of the Right is "not hard to figure out"!
Perhaps with all the other problems left behind by Bush...you know, like the mass hemorrhaging of jobs per month, banks too big to fail, increasing high unemployment, 2 wars that were costing billion of $$'s per week, avoiding a Depression, turbulent countries with serious bad-actors around the World - well, I would think some things were tabled and prioritized.  Congress certainly had enough information...but they somehow refused to 'fund' the VA saying it cost too much (as they then voted to give billions in tax breaks to the very rich)!  Hmmmm...I wonder why?  All are culpable of this fiasco - Obama, the Admin., AND Congress!  If 'blame' is you game - lay it on all responsible...not just the Prez in order to fit and justify any personal bias against the 'man' himself!
Frankie - Provide an argument, rebuttal, or some semblance of intelligent debate - otherwise you just sound stupid!  Brief enough for you, dimwit?!
Are you serous?  LOL!  Congressional reps aren't "leaders"??  Whew, that's rich!  Congress is an equal branch of government who control the purse and enact Laws...but to you, they aren't 'leaders'!  And...you ARE aware there's a U.S. Office of Veteran's Affairs, correct?  You are aware that States also have their own Veteran Affairs offices, correct?  Now that Obama is in office you seriously think they've suddenly woken up to the problems?  You are aware that Bush supposedly handed this off to the Obama Admin - but according to you Congress had no prior knowledge of the problem!  Jeez!  You guys will say anything...deny everything...as long as you can find a way to blame Obama for something!  The sky is grey...must be Obama's fault the Sun isn't shining...!!  Good grief!
cPresident know the severity of it??!!  Such sage logic...NOT!
So then to you, ALL members of Congress are to blame? And not those actually RUNNING it?
yes
Ponder the phrase "walking on egg shells" for a bit. I know exactly what he's dealt with. I had an evil wife, who at one point ceased all contribution to life, opting for a free ride in all respects, looking for every opportunity to undermine my authority with my kids, looked to destroy my name in any corner that she could reach...all up to the point when she herself hit rock bottom from substance abuse and gluttony. I learned really quickly who to trust and who to run over or disassociate myself from...it made me stronger. President Obama has my utmost respect for having accomplished so much. No,  we're definitely not used to a President having to spend months at a time painting political opposition into a corner for even the simplest tasks (think "debt ceiling). But compare that to the common belief that Dick Cheney was really the otherwise unelectable President of the United States for 8 years.

We've come a very very very long way over the past 6 years on all fronts, and President Obama had very little help. I'm 100 percent confident that the facts will stand on their own. Your everyday conservative doesn't want to hear this, but the Republicans and Tea Party were vested in nothing more than trying to punish the American people for voting in a Black President and dissuade us from ever doing it again. I sincerely believe that is the truth whether consciously or unconsciously. 

I'll never forget the 2008 campaign and rally footage of the conservatives across America coming unhinged and predicting unspeakable horrors if Obama was elected. After the election, they needed it all to be true...even if they had to help with the details a little. Most people thought they'd snap back to reality. It never happened. I think we're looking at permanent conservative dysfunction that is, sad to say, going to be increasingly and then exclusively based on race politics in the years to come. 
#stillbushsfaultafter5.5years...lol
#liberallunactic
All that you said is true, but Obama has proved by now incapable of acting in an executive and decisive manner but dithers instead judiciously while deciding very little.
I'd be sorry that I voted for him twice but his opponents were even worse twits.
The truth shall set you free!
Dude, what in the name of all that is good, are you smoking??  Seriously, are you on some DNC payroll, or something?  Are you blind?  Intellectually challenged?  Really, I think you should stick to commenting on topics that you have an ounce of knowledge about.
Oh yeah, and by the way? He speaks for a lot more vets than you. Just compare upvotes. He's got like 10 TIMES yours. The news isn't sprawling with countless interviews of countless VSO's and politicians all claiming their veteran constituency is absolutely livid--because they're all happy with their care and "immune to reason and logic." If you want to yell "stupid" at someone, go do it in the mirror. The vast majority are not on your side. They're ripping the VA a new one, and the VSO's are screaming their defense from the rooftops.

Do the math yourself. Count how many murdered disabled veterans would agree with you. Go count how many widows and orphans the VA has now stranded to go insane on Memorial Day and Veterans Day from now on. Try doing anything about it. Federal institutions are answerable to nobody and have their own police force they'll call to throw you out if you say anything against them.

Private hospitals ARE answerable to local courts, and ARE under the jurisdiction of local police. If they murder you, there IS recourse. If their police beat you down or violate your rights in any way, the local police will arrest their guards. If the local court issues a protection order against an irresponsible doctor, and that doctor ignores it, the local police will come and arrest that doctor. If they murder you, collect a bonus, then disappear all your data so it looks like you were never there, a local attorney can take them to a local court and get a judgement. If they ignore that judgement, the local Sheriff can execute a Levy, and protect you while you just walk into their building and legally rob the place for the amount they owe you. All of these things keep private hospitals in check. They make mistakes--but they also pay heavily for them.

There are no checks and balances like this in place with federal institutions. You get what you get, and you don't get upset. If you doubt this, look up a VAOIG report issued in 2010 that EXPLAINED EVERYTHING EVERYONE IS PRETENDING TO BE SURPRISED ABOUT RIGHT NOW. It was all given to them then, but they didn't have to do anything, so they ignored it.
Not pertinent, oh "law school" drop out!
That's part of the lie. All the information one can research, until recently, is in their favor, because THEY'RE the ones writing it. Even when the VAOIG--and yes, that's VA, does feel safe enough to stop praising them, nobody listens.

Here's something for YOU to research. in 2010, the VAOIG produced a report explaining everything that everyone with something to lose is pretending to be shocked and surprised about. FOUR years ago, all this was exposed, and nobody did anything.

Why? Because they don't have to. Federal institutions are answerable to nobody, no matter how many they kill. If you have a problem with that, good luck dealing with their private police who they will call at the drop of a hat, are stationed inside the building, don't answer to local courts or police command, have no Internal Affairs, and answer ONLY to the murderers.

So, just go do the research. All that's needed for these murderers to CONTINUE murdering, is for good people to do nothing but put on a smile, kiss their axx, and tell everyone else how foolish they are--just like their private police force does.
You couldn't even get a minimum wage job Mikey.  You signed up to learn a trade & used up VA benefit you could get your grubby little hands on!

You spent 38 years on the government dole & now complain about those who have actually earned their benefits!
He hates the military and blames them for his 38 years of failure.
Perhaps because he can't dumb it down enough to reach you uneducated level?
Ignore Mikey - he has failed for 38 years and hates the military, blaming him for his personal failures,

He constantly rants against these LEGAL & AUTHORIZED payments which are only paid when GOVERNMENT HOUSING is NOT AVAILABLE.  He hopes someone even more stupid than he is will believe his lies.
He is trying level best in resolving this solution. He and Obama was briefed about this before his first inauguration. We all should hope that VA issue will be fixed soon.
You are so right re the military. They are usually embarrassed when light is shown on them for any reason. They are some of the most special among us.
That make you feel better?
Yeah, they aren't on the "official" waiting lists any longer. That's the problem...
racker
What good does caring about something that happened 10,20,70 years ago do now??  The injustices of the past can't be corrected. It's unfathomable that we'd spend 1 second crying about what Bush or Clinton or Bush or...did, if that time could be better spent improving now, and the future.
Great points.  I'd like to add something I haven't really seen in other comments.  We've failed to factor in that the troops the VA is serving have already been equipped to handle adversity.  They know how to survive without a couple of meals. They know how to stand in endless lines.  They know how to endure hardships that those who haven't served should be glad they've never had to endure.  When the VA puts the screws to them- that's just a little more adversity.  THAT is how some of these things live, undetected, for such long periods of time.  It's simply a little more adversity.
As "eye popping" as that figure may be, it represents less than 3% of military spending. How is the other 97% spent.  Military spending is the sacred cash cow.  No politicians will go after it, even though it is where the bulk of federal overspending occurs.
Is that really important to note?  Those that voted for Obama twice are unlikely to have voted for Bush, and vice versa.  It's not difficult to make a reasonable argument that voting for either was a bad decision.  If we determine one's logical capabilities by their vote for either candidate, we are essentially claiming the entire population is void of logic.


Obama being in office doesn't change the decision to vote for Bush.  It was either good or bad, depending on your perspective and what history will dictate.  It's not witty to point out it's an old decision.
Vets tend to talk to other vets.  He's likely speaking for a group of people.  That's what logic will find.


It's a tad astounding you ridicule his logic while the comment he replied to is apparently logical to you.  It offers no more substance, but the opposite claim.  


Let's do your math.  If we grow exponentially, that means the current generation is a great deal larger than the elderly generation.  This means there should be more personnel equipped, assuming percentages don't drop drastically, to handle the elderly.  


I'm not surprised you're amazed by logic.
And "deliberate manipulation of official waiting times" ... I'm sorry, did Shinseki actually do the scheduling at the Phoenix branch? Or was that Obama? As part of his Presidency, did Obama fly out to Phoenix each morning and schedule patients? 


EXACTLY the same thing happened under Bush as happened under Obama -- except int he case of Bush, these were combat injured vets coming back from Iraq at the height of that war who'd spent years trying to get help from the VA while Bush cut brush back in Crawford. Get you rhead out of your a55.
Why not try responding with at least a modicum of reason and intelligence? 
Fixing it? You eedjit, they let it GO for years. The Walter Reed scandal was not another name for "fixing the VA," you m0r0n.
Yeah, that's scheduling, just like the problems during the Bush years. Where's the "deliberate, knowing death and suffering" part you'v been blabbing about.
Wow you are so juvenile with that comment. 
I don't but you seem to. The original insult was made at those who serve in non-combat positions. My words were to the effect that any of those who serve in non-combat MOS's, could just as easily be called into combat. When one signs up to the military, there are no lines where one goes they qualify and those do not...all sign up to serve.
Again, you're mentally slow / ill.

There is a HUGE DIFFERENCE, obviously, between fixing mismanagement and *deliberate criminal fraudulent practices*

WASHINGTON -- A preliminary report by the inspector general of the Department of Veterans Affairs has found deliberate manipulation of official waiting times in its investigation of alleged criminal misconduct by management at a Phoenix VA hospital.

still..........................waiting.........................
Do you have an issue with reading comprehension? Of course service connected injuries are a part of the picture!  Are you a university graduate? I am suspect of your intellect. 
You need to get yourself some education.
You show me in the IG's report the phraes "*deliberate fraud* and *knowingly letting Vets suffer and die" and I'll suck any thumb you want. You won't because, quite simply, you cannot.
still waiting............
Read a little bit about what was taking place betwen 2003 and 2007, before Bush finally got around to noticing: http://www.washingtonpost.COM/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/17/AR2007021701172.html



And you cut that yutz slack? What a turrrrrrd you are.
In case it hasn't occurred to you, but in many cases, those who serve in non-combat situations are under the same rules of active service as all others. At any time, those in the back areas might well end up on the frontlines. You insult all service members.
Yeah, after people were dying and being mistreated for years at Walter Reed after coming back from Iraq, Brush-Cutting Bush  decides maybe something should be done ... like cutting the VA budget. OMG, what a hero. And if you can show me some documentation that proves today's VA was deliberately killing people, that'd be great. Otherwise, it's just your jaw working overtime.
I am in full agreement with both the prior and current SECDEF's public statements declaring that the all volunteer military has vastly bloated personnel costs that are "unsustainable." And here's one facet of those vastly bloated costs that everyone can relate to.

I just checked the DOD travel site to see the new "BAH" (or basic allowance for housing) tables for 2014. They were just increased ON AVERAGE by an incredible 5%. Some locations, including no less that tropical vacation destination for many- HawaiiI, were increased by a whopping 15% AND MORE! And in 2013 they were ALSO INCREASED by 3.8% on average as well!

For those of you who do not know, these monthly allowances (that in actuality are tax free handouts) for optional off-ship or off-base 'housing' needs for military volunteers are (a) tax free; (b) above and beyond base pays, other pays, and other tax free allowances; and (c) require no proof whatsoever that they are even being used for optional off-ship or off-base 'housing.'

Here's a small sample of these staggering figures by 4 cites and 3 ranks for "dual married' military couples (when two members marry each other, including homosexual couples) with 1 dependent:

Washington, DC:
Two married E-3s*: $3,612
Two married E-7s**: $4,608
Two married O-6s***: $5,919

San Diego:
Two married E-3s: $3,552
Two married E-7s: $4,608
Two married O-6s: $5,553

Honolulu, HI
Two married E-3s: $4,563
Two married E-7s: $6,060
Two married O-6s: $7,778

San Francisco, CA
Two married E-3s: $5,709
Two married E-7s: $7,116
Two married O-6s: $8,949

* E-3s are typically 18/19 years old, GED or HS educated, wiith 1 year in the military since moving out of their parent's homes.

** E-7s are the same as above but add 10-12 years

*** Essentially all 'dual married' O-6 couples are already being paid cumulatively from $220,000-$280,000 per year in combined base pays, other pays, and other tax free allowances. And all other lower ranked dual married officer couples are being paid from $125,000-$250,000 per year!

Every word cited above is true. And every eye-popping and absurd figure is fully accurate that was taken right from the "2014 BAH Tables."

The culture of entitlement is alive and well in our nation's all volunteer military. DOD ought to be ashamed of itself for this $21 BILLION per year tax free monthly GRAVY TRAIN that 99% of the general US population knows anything about (until now)! 

Contact your members of Congress today to get this preposterous $21 billion per year and growing waste stopped.
So that Cook in the rear lines  that doesnt get shot at during war should not get any care from VA . Theres allot of support groups during war from all over and they are serving their country during war time just a different job. They are still war vets..
"As President Bush wrapped up his visit an hour earlier than scheduled, his administration moved to improve care. The Office of Personnel Management approved a measure to streamline the hiring of medical workers to fill 115 positions at Walter Reed related to patient care".

"Army Secretary Pete Geren said in a statement yesterday that a planned consolidation and expansion at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda will improve the medical infrastructure in the Washington region."

GO CRY. Before you go off to weep and suck your thumb, I'm still waiting for you to explain how that remotely compares to *deliberate fraud* with *knowingly letting Vets suffer and die*.
Its really not that complicated.  If you can show me any other requirement for receiving VA care besides being a veteran (I dont think you can have a dishonorable discharge)  I will cede the argument and delcalre you the victor.
Take that, Ted Cruz!
Shinseki is retired military, a combat veteran who lost a good portion of one foot to a land mine.  Hardly a loser.
Precisely.  They were set up as a safety net for Veterans who could not be cared for elsewhere. Vets, even those who have pre-existing conditions can now sign up for health plans on the exchange, or medicaid plans if they are destitute..
Again you are obviously someone much more educated than I who has the ability to type in CAPS but let me save you the trouble of googling it.  The only requirement I am aware of is that you are a veteran.  I am aware to specification that you have to be a combat veteran to receive VA benefits.  So you can type in caps all you want but it doesnt make you correct.
It's complicated. Go visit a web site. Or better yet see the post above from only-view. The VA medical centers WERE NEVER set up to see all of the millions of vets!
I thought personal attacks like his were against CNNs user agreement?
According to the VA; "They die all the time.  Fewer to care for"
Can't fix 70 years ago.  Obammer has been in charge for 6 years, and done nothing, because he hates the military, and all who served.
Well then since you seem to be more informed than me what are the pre-requisites for receiving medical care at a VA facility currently?
Pretty much correct
No need to copy and paste your entry doesn't answer any questions.
Wake up call!  Simply by joining the mil to run away from your min wage job and your mommy and daddy's house with your GED or HS diploma in hand, and joining not as a grunt but as a cookie baker in training or as an entry-level office clerk, and then serving as same for four years DOES NOT ENTITLE YOU TO A LIFE-LONG FREE RIDE FOR HEALTHCARE OFF TGE BACKS OF THE US TAXPAYERS AT VA MEDICAL CENTERS!
(Use the Contact Us button below to report the personal attacks to CNN. Com - the mods will look at his history that way)
I'm a new guy. And so far, you've said nothing more than a 6th grader might say. And I'm brainless?
Dems and coathangers way of life is a simplistic one
If you work for the government you only work there because you can't cut it in the private field. With that being said, no one in the government should ever receive a "bonus" or any other compensation outside of their salary, and a better insurance plan than anyone else can get and for much cheaper. 

Oh yeah, that and some bogus holiday once every 2 weeks. 
Who says the incidents that took place during the Bush watch  did not involve DELIBERATELY implementing fraudulent practices KNOWINGLY causing Vets to suffer & die? You? Please.
Your comment demonstrates your fervent opposition to education!
Congratulation !!
say, have they tried to remove the coat hanger from your skull from when your momma tried to partially abort you...
Just for the record my attorney cannot do surgery on my foot. Both men are well educated and top of the heap in their respective careers and like Shinseki highly respected for  service to our country but that does NOT mean he can run a business. The person running the VA should know how to run a non profit . Money never was the problem. Corruption, greed and  lack of empathy by those in charge  are the causes . Couple that with the fact that in our government if no one complains,there is no problem and it is all Bush's fault. There now problem solved.
This crap going on in DC is not politics, it is illegal, dishon est ,immoral actions and they have NO respect for any American citizens and it does NOT matter what political party you belong to ,what color,religion or sex you are. They think we are stupid and maybe we are if we let them keep dividing us against each other and ignore what they are doing. 
 
My bet is some will lose their jobs and then get higher paying jobs with the government in other departments like the DOJ or DOE. They never go away ,they just recycle them  and we all will be on our respective computers as we are this morning fighting who is right and who is wrong ,dividing ourselves rather that kicking their a**** out of office either in a court of law or by ballot.
you're just a brainless tool...not worth any more of my time...
I have been around our local VA for up to 30 years, and knowing many of the Vets who went there from WWII, through Iraq/Afghanistan, not a single one of them has ever wanted to see the VA shut down and be shifted to private care. Many corporations have some sort of serious problems, but they do not simply shut down and tell people to buy somewhere else. They fix the problem and keep going. What I am seeing here, today, are so many calling for the VA to turn tail and run, to shut down. Never mind fixing anything, just shut down. Of which no real thought processes are engaged in looking at the long term effects of doing that. Because for one, the VA is not a danged business, and is there to serve our Veterans. When problems come up, we should SOLVE them, not retreat form them.
That is what I meant for.
If you get drunk and kill someone in a car accident you might not have intended to kill anyone but your negligence will still get you a homicide charge. 
Senate dems are turning on him now.See ya loser.
say, have you ever been out of that rural, southern parish of your birth.......?
Some people don't like facts they don't like. You appear to be one of them.
as do you..you brainless obamasucking tool..
You contribute SO much to the political discourse.....
Doctors have seen those injuries and would treat them with more modern medicine, facilities and techniques.  
I dropped cable for DirectTV.

Finally, what do you call a doctor who finished last in his medical class?  Lieutenant.
you brainless obamasucking tool....
you brainless obamasucking tool..
I knew some Republiturd would find some reason the Bush incident would be "different."
That did not involve DELIBERATELY implementing fraudulent practices KNOWINGLY causing Vets to suffer & die. This does.



If you went to a doctor who wasn't very good at surgery, would that be the same to you as a surgeon who deliberately tried to kill you?
And just when GWB opened his floodgate of wounded vets - he did nothing....
you brainless obamasucking tool...
I replied above. For some reason cnn wouldn't let me copy/paste the comment here. 
2003 -- A commission appointed by President George W. Bush reports that as of January 2003, some 236,000 veterans had been waiting six months or more for initial or follow-up visits, "a clear indication," the commission said, "of lack of sufficient capacity or, at a minimum, a lack of adequate resources to provide the required care."

So, I guess GWB fixed everything and now Obama has "let it all go" again.......?
Right, so have I, add in IED's, rocket propelled grenades, brain trauma, PTSD, missing limbs, severe disfigurement, etc. 
On cable, keep thinking, and watch as like Comcast is after Direct TV, and watch the pricing.
That didn't involve DELIBERATELY implementing fraudulent practices KNOWINGLY causing Vets to suffer & die.  This does.
Liberals are so compassionate...you brainless obamasucking tool...
LOLOLOLOL!!!


1)  You're on "CNN's" website


2)  The facts come from the VA IG report


3)  You're completely whacked in the head to conclude the courts determined Fox as "entertainment".  It had to do with libtardians at a local Fox affiliate in FL trying to force a reporter to post known-erroneous data.
(2007) Outrage erupts after documents released to CNN show some senior VA officials received bonuses of up to $33,000 despite a backlog of hundreds of thousands of benefits cases and an internal review that found numerous problems, some of them critical, at VA facilities across the nation.....
You really think vets dying is a joke you brainless obamasucking tool...
So then our Veterans become a "economic" liability then right? And who would pay for the demanded increase of private facilities, and do not leave out increased personnel as well? For another, you guys are seriously "ignoring" one key factor here. The Veterans approve of the VA healthcare, as do their families. The problem is this as we see right now, the waiting list. Do not confuse the two. Push out the VA, and institute private care will result in more problems.
Dude, I'm a veteran and seen what assault rifles can do to a human body.  And you know what, gangs in Chicago and New York have those assault rifles.  So yes, doctors in those areas have seen those types of wounds.

Regarding the cable industry, that is a great example.  When cable became too high priced with limited selection, the satellite TV industry emerged.  Cable must compete or die.

The total number of vets may have declined but is the bulk of the costs the result of the last two wars? Runaway healthcare costs don't only effect the private sector. The costs of big pharma continue to rise. We need to get under where the money is going.
-----------

According to that same article:

Even more telling, wounded warriors coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan are not increasing treatment costs.

A congressional budget office report found that they cost $4,800 on average in 2010 compared to $8,800 for other veterans who used the system.

It also found that while they accounted for 7% of those who were treated, they were responsible for only 4% of its health costs.
Veterans do have lobbyists.  The American Legion and the VFW among them.  What they dont have is the deep pockets that corporate lobbyists do.  That, and sometimes the lobbyists they do have dont do their job.
Yeah, those private hospitals see all the same kind of wounds every day as what the Veterans have. Oh, and as for your remark about "market demand", how'd that work for cable industry? many, now merged into few, with still grotesque pricing and poor service. And for the insurance industry, and their consistently rising premiums far above rate of inflation.
Who said that? Not me. All I stated was a fact to counter a commonly parroted myth. 
I am a "Veteran", and know where I am. The VA is for Veterans, and is set up to deal with the many needs of the Veterans, including their families. Government runs the VA, the VA in turn are staffed by people. And like any large corporation/business, you have the good, the bad, and the idiots. And like any of the large corporations it is not always easy to spot the skaters and dump them. Government can provide the "tools", it is up to humans to use them.
If Veterans have lobbyist, then this issue wont prop up at all.
First...points to you for reference IBD...might be the single, best fact-based publication in the US right now.  Secondly...there is a counter point to the numbers you give...number of vets has gone down, but appointments have increased.
Shineski's had his flipping position for nearly SIX years!!!  There is a system-wide failure, and it was allowed to be perpetuated right under his nose!  Regardless of the character of his military service, it means crap, when the lives of veterans are lost because of fraud and deception.  


The SADDEST part of all of this?  Yes, there have been more vets than there have services for decades.  So, why is it that this kind of garbage has to come to light before people get hacked ff enough to say/do something about it??  There aren't groups that lobby against vets, folks.  Make your voices heard- letters, calls, votes- and stop this horrible injustice.
The total number of vets may have declined but is the bulk of the costs the result of the last two wars? Runaway healthcare costs don't only effect the private sector. The costs of big pharma continue to rise. We need to get under where the money is going.
You're one of those:

The government is the only ones capable of taking care of our needs kind of people aren't you. 
Not in the numbers that constitute our military Veterans. They refer to that as "hospital patient census". Meaning how many patients they have, and how many more might be accommodated. Most hospitals would have to enlarge heavily, hire more professionals, and add the rising cost to your tab.
Those wounds are no different than they see every day in Chicago, New York, etc.  If there was demand, the market would emerge to meet that demand.
mac4242, what?  no we are not happy with the service we are getting.  How to do you support your statement?
John Merline at Investors Business daily crunched the numbers and found that:

The VAs budget has been exploding, even as the number of veterans steadily declines.

VA spending nearly tripled from 2000 to 2013, while the population of veterans declined by 4.3 million...
They would accommodate, as there is an economic incentive to take those patients.

You dream a lot. The private hospitals are not geared up to treat the many Veterans with such serious wounds in large numbers. You deal with "economics 101", but fail to complete the course.
Well that's what republicans want. 

See to a republican, the less the government does, the better off we are. 

Republicans don't want our elected leaders finding new ways to increase the size of the government.  
Does it matter? Between the two of them and the President before them- They have driven the country into the ground. They have embarrassed the nation with their antics, created widespread disrespect and fear of American government by Americans, and they continuously strive to undermine the rights and privacies of American citizens.
And Bush is the 5th lowest rated President ever.
private hospitals deal with illegals on a daily basis...your the one deflecting
That's not within the VA system, and your deflection is duly noted. And they get care on an emergency room only, and then out the door. 
Yes I do. See when you compensate someone for something there is an incentive to accommodate in order to receive the pay you receive from the accommodation.  Economics 101. 
I've been saying that for years.  Sure there would be issues at the beginning, as those veterans would move into the system; however, the private sector would expand to accommodate the increased demand.  Veterans also wouldn't have to wait for care, as they'd just choose another doctor if the wait was too long.
They seem to be handling illegals with no problems...
I really advise you to go back to grade school and develop the rest of your cerebral cortex, because sweet Lord I have no idea if you were dropped on your head as a child or if Fox News has destroyed what was left of the intelligence you may have had. 
Because this notion that Republicans actually contributed to something is so paltry.
If contributing, you mean attempting to repeal a constitutionally-backed law by one of the most conservative Supreme Courts this country has seen to date, waste taxpayer dollars on such roll calls to repeal a piece of legislation is by far disingenuous. That's what's wrong with the GOP (and yourself, it seems): You think that the cards are in your hands is the winning hand, but you're playing a pair of 2s against a full house. If the GOP have all such great ideas about healthcare, they would have won a presidential election. Simple as that.

Actions speak louder than words, pinkelephant, and the actions that the GOP have taken since '08 are by no means short of disingenuous.
And you really believe, that the private hospitals are geared up to receive a very large influx of new patients with very serious conditions, anmd will be able to meet their needs? Right!
Honestly. Why not just purchase a top notch insurance policy from a private insurance company for vets, that is paid for by the federal government and let the vets use that insurance to get treatment from the private medical industry?

I don't understand why the government has to be any more involved than that. 
A person I know who has never had health insurance is able to go today to the doctor to see about a serious issue he has...this man has worked hard all his life, is not a druggie or a slacker.  The company he worked for did not supply insurance and because of his issue he was unable to get insurance until now with the affordable care act! The VA problems are not comparable to the ACA.  Another person I know has had mental issues and now, they are being dealt with in a way the insurance companies refused to do until the ACA.
You understand neither the VA nor PPACA>
Really bad analogy.
Bush "saved the economy..."???  Are you delusional...or just doing what Republicans always do, rewrite history?  Republican revisionism displayed...!
That's because the vets they interviewed to get that statistic are the ones that actually got seen by a doctor.  The ones that aren't satisfied are already dead and can't complain.
Man did you start a blogging thread here! Being a vet myself, I've been lucky enough not to have had serious health issues. However, If words were instead medical VA actions this here thread would have diagnosed, treated, re-examined, cured, then re-evaluated the cure, questioned the original diagnosis, and finally buried one while blaming my next door neighbor!!
Ah! A personal assessment through mere observation. Often used as a basis. For example: I have been all around North America and Europe, and with the exception of a few mountains and valleys, I have determined the world is - generally speaking - flat.



I'll be sure to bookmark your comment and use it for reference in the future.


<b>Thanks!</b>
Welcome to the future of obamacare. 
Per the Wallstreet Journal (2012):  "...banks were repaying TARP funds with cash earmarked for small-business loans, after the Independent Community Bankers of America lobbied for the ability to switch money "from one Treasury program to the other."

Small businesses have continued to struggle to get credit, a drag on the recovery, while banks have been using funds earmarked for lending to small businesses simply to pay back their first TARP bailout".  Fact: 48 percent of the banks that have repaid the CPP used money they'd gotten from other federal programs.
Can you do that?
The thing is, we can make the politicians step down yet we continually vote them back into office. 

Were the dots. Not them. 
I AM a veteran ...because I also have private insurance and Medicare I used BOTH the VA and the private sector . I am actually happier with the VA . ...NOW , call ME a snotty name ...
HILARIOUS.  You really are dumber than a box of shlltt.


The proposal by Republicans was obviously an important one.  That's why your clowns implemented months later.  And yet, their refusal on this one point was the cause of the shutdown.

What is your definition of "doing something"?  Agreeing w/your clowns?  Hundreds of Democrat, Republican, and BiPartisan House bills sit under the wrinkledAss of your Senate leader.  So again, what's your definition of "doing something"?

Developmentally Slow = clinging to policies like those implemented in the glorious shlltthole of Detroit.


"Dumb" doesn't even begin to describe you.
Specifically, how so?
yes, Bush was wrong for leaving the VA in the state he did.


Obama is wrong for failing to act on the VA until now as well.
In fact when Eric Shenski took office there were back log of 918,000 veterans, now the count reduced to 338,000.

GOP has blocked all the Veterans Bill since 1999.. W had cut the VA funding in 2005. Also Eric Shenski warned W administration about Iraq war, he testified before congress in the beginning of 2003... He told then the amount of VA will increase four folds. W administration laughed at him and he has resigned due to that.

He had served in Vietnam war, first gulf war and he knows how the Veterans administration. He is much qualified and will fix all the mess created by past administrations.

VA verification process has been outsourced to private company, they always take their own time in responding to VA. They have been paid millions of dollars.

To me, blame comes last. Fix the system by employing more and funding more and open new facilities...

Bernie Sanders bill this year in February 2014 was blocked by GOP (21 billion dollars which will paid over 10 years).

The same GOP now, they are whining about VA...

Instead of joining together, they want to score political points. This is nutshell.
Maybe the person in charge of sending out timely welfare checks should be moved to the department of veterans affairs because clearly that person knows what they are doing. 
After assessing the F'n mess his boss has made of this country, Shinseki has little incentive to do anything.
Become a veteran and find out little man.
They are my primary customer and I am in their offices daily, throughout the country.


I also have acceptable eyesight and the ability to tell the difference between colors. 


I said his post was in bad taste. He did not, however, say anything about people not being nice, which is what the person responding to the post had the big problem with.
To eaches own.  As I already stated, I understand what you're saying but this will continue to happen if no President or Congress member acts and passes it to the next guy.  Everyone who does that is equally wrong.
The Right has such short memories!  Are you serious??  Don't you remember the 800,000 jobs hemorrhaging per month?  Don't you remember the unsurety of your own job? How about the high unemployment rate that is now around 6%!  Other than contributing to the unemployment lines by cutting Federal jobs, what has the Congress done...you know, the group that controls the purse??!  Lack of recovery??  Jeez, I know, THIS Pres has to get it down to 2% before you'll consider giving him any credit for putting into place policies that avoided a Depression!
Too bad you can't ask the ones who died. Imagine you serve your country, survive combat and your government's health care system kills you.
Those killed don't need medical care, do they?  Look at the wounded under your clown.


And just to add a point regarding military deaths:


Clinton - 7,000+
Basically, I'm holding the current President responsible for what he knowingly allowed to occur no his watch.


Period. 


Obama knew what was going on, and did nothing.


That's his responsibility.


The fact that Bush didn't fix this problem before Obama took office is not Obama's responsibility.


The fact that Obama didn't fix it when Obama was in office, is not Bush's responsibility.


Bush is responsible for the state he left the VA in.


Obama is responsible for knowingly doing nothing to fix it, and there's really no way that you can spin it, that Obama knowingly doing nothing for going on 6 years is not Obama's fault.
And you get your statistics on the racial profile of VA employees from where?
I've always been happy with it. 
I guess that's because I work to ensure I have insurance but hey, personal responsibility has never been big with you liberals. 
Ignorant usually means not factual. His post, although could be argued is not in good taste, is factual.
And yet, the obstruction met by THIS President is unprecedented in American history! No past President has ever had to deal with a Congress who stated the day after his inaugaration that they won't work with him on anything...no matter how good for the American people his proposals are - and their main goal is to make him a one-term President!   I wonder why....?
So basically you're treating this as a relay race.  The previous President passes the baton to the next and that person now holds 100% of blame.  I get what you're saying but I don't completely agree.  Each President and Congress member that decides to "pass the buck" to the next person is equally guilty.
Mac 4242 is correct.  Survey after survey of veterans bring this out consistently, do not ask me how as I don't get it either unless these books are also being cooked?
What an ignorant comment. I am white and some of the nicest people are not white either.
Concur!
Bigotted remarks without a shred of evidence are counter productive to fixing the problem.  

Perhaps they are simply responding to your very obvious bigotry.
Bull S  T
You do note the 800 plus up votes to the person you responded to versus your post, right?


You know nothing of what you speak. I have worked personally with VA hospitals for the majority of my life. They are atrocious and our veterans deserve better.


They certainly deserve much better than a weak failed President in a bomber jacket. It makes me want to vomit seeing a man that has never run a business, a lifetime bureaucrat, act like he is for our Veterans.


Say no to Government run healthcare PERIOD.
Exactly!  The one central reason why so many 'former' Republicans now claim to be Independent!  To 'own' Bush would be to own the worst Prez in a Century!  As an Independent they deny culpability by making us think THEY didn't keep him in office for 8 years as he put the US economy in the tank, increased corporate welfare, and needlessly went into a war that resulted in the deaths of over 4,000 Americans!  No....they can't claim that 'legacy'...and to obfuscate those 'facts', they MUST try to paint our current Prez as 'worse'!  It makes them feel better!  Note that at no time do they ever hold their own congressmen accountable for doing absolutely NOTHING the past 4 years!  Remember the 2010 mantra - Jobs, Jobs, Jobs?  What have they done to create even one??!  Oh yeah, whatever they didn't do is Obama's fault!!
Most of the VAs with rude and unprofessional staff members are the facilities where the majority of that staff is black. 
Individual members of Congress aren't "leaders". Sorry, but leadership is the role of the Presidency. 


As of yet, there's no evidence that any members of Congress from either side were aware of this particular problem at the VA. They are currently acting on it by bringing legislation that they hope will force the Executive branch to finally resolve the issue.
Cherry picked to support your opinion.  No truth there, Binky boy.
your response is more appropriate to the original poster - mac4242 as  MJKnJAK was being satiric -- but that would be lost on you and your obviously superior brain...
I think the VA sucks ....don't speak for all vets like me -- but I can speak for 4 close vet friends all getting treatment at the VA  and they say it sucks
Mikey has no factual data, simply a 38 year hatred of all things military which he blames for those 38 years of failure that is his life.
Bush is responsible for the state of the VA through the end of 2008 (Jan 5 2009 to be exact).


You can even blame him through a bit of 2009.


Obama knew about this on day one of his Presidency, and it is now 6 years later.


This is no longer Bush's fault. The VA is ONLY this way because Obama has allowed to remain this way.
Since you are usually both, why bother the guy!
Nqqer. 
lol... well, to be honest, I have had the pleasure of leading a group like that.


But even if I hadn't... that's what leadership is.


And, I can still be independent, while noticing that Obama doesn't lead.
And he is banned/blocked on just about every other sote than CNN.

GOT TO LOVE THOSE BOARD MONITORS!
OPINIONS do not require responses, Mikey.  And your entire semester of law school shows that you have not even a "modicum of intelligence" to respond to.
It doesn't take and Einstein to realize that this is inappropriate and neglectful.  Healthcare is an institution that is supposed to be integrity filled, ethical, professional, accountable, and compassionate to all patients.
Mikey spent HIS entire 5 years of "service" (term used very loosely) to lern a trade on a signle vessel in SD harbour (76-81) .  Hates the military and blames them for his 38 years of failure YET managed to use every single VA benefit that existed!
Seriously???  You omitted A WAR, pinkele!  

Iraq + Afghanistan:




BUSH -    4,852 killed
OBAMA - 1,956 killed

Source:  icasualties . org
Got any actual data to support that OPINION of yours, Mikey? Thought not, you never have.
Nor have you or the trailer trash Ricky Bobby had a welfare check arrive late.
...and less so than many past Presidents!  It IS in his power and right to do so - especially when the Right has no ideas on how to govern or create any new Bills to fix anything...SOMEBODY has to get something done.  Your side certainly isn't.  They'd rather sit back, criticize and accuse, and bamboozle their gullible followers into thinking that's "governing"!    Your point....??
OPINION, still no factual support for that whiney little opinion of yours, Mikey.
And Folks as Paul Harvey would say and that's the way it is at the VA today
well said good human, well said
OPINION and no basis in fact.  Sems to be a constant problem wtih this uneducated poster.
From someone who spent 5 years in the NAVY learning a trade and has now spent 38 years attacking the military and blaming them for his 38 years of FAILURE!  

Oh, speaking of "entitlement morigund veters" = YOU USED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR ENTITILEMENTS, Mikey!   And now want others to net get their chance.  What a pice of feces you are.
Veterans who fought for this country may not receive timely medical care, but you can rest assured that LaQueeta the hoodrat has never had a welfare check arrive late. 
Yeah -- I sure do.  U.S. Military casualties in Afghanistan:


BUSH
Deaths - 630
Wounded - 7,000+


OBAMA
Deaths - 2317
Wounded - 18,000+
If you ask a Middleeasterner why they have so many terrorists, he would point out there are other terrorist groups too, like Tamils.

So when the current president is undeniably on the wrong side, these guys will point out other prez were bad as well.  And if you dare to say something they don't agree, they will unleash a barrage of personal attacks, name callings or you shouldn't have children.  Oh well, typical liberals.
You must have never served your Country!
Funny coming from an individual who spent his entire "time in service" on a single vessel in SD harbour learning a trade YET WHO USED EVERY BENEFIT HE COULD SCRAPE UP.
Simply because no one wants to get that deep into the sewer you live in, Mikey.
Ira - approximately 6.3% of the military is in a dual-military status (two military members married to each other).  According to the 2012 Demographics (http://www(dot)militaryonesource(dot)mil/12038/MOS/Reports/2012_Demographics_Report.pdf):

Nbr & Percent of Dual Marriages by Branch:
- Army Officers: 6,587 (6.7%)
- Army Enlisted: 21,735 (4.9%)
- Navy Officers: 2,761 (5.2%)
- Navy Enlisted: 12,371 (4.7%)
- Marine Officers: 900 (4.1%)
- Marine Enlisted: 6,565 (3.7%)
- Air Force Officers: 6,652 (10.2%)
- Air Force Enlisted: 30.422 (11.5%)

By paygrade, this is what the distribution looks like:

- E1-E4: 24,656
- E5-E6: 34,961
- E7-E9: 11,476
- W1-W5: 1,214
- O1-O3: 9,499
- O4-O6: 6,145
- O7-O10: 42

The report has lots of intriguing statistics in it. It will be interesting to see what the changes are for the 2013 report (to be published this year).
You are like the true democrat - never served in the army, and now are trying to support your Commander in Chief, when the reality starts showing!  I know of 4 other Vet families, 3 are very close relations, as in Grandparents, and father in law, and they were NEVER happy with their VA benefits.  In fact, they supplemented with private insurance that they paid out of their own pockets, so that they could go elsewhere to take care of their more critical needs!
M F, I see so many Vets with broken bodies who would have died in previous wars now requiring care for those everlasting injuries which increases the care needs of these wounded DA Vets.
Looks like to me ....he, the many who have died and the 1000's who thought they were on a waiting list would agree with MGKnJAC...........bonehead...............
Want to check your numbers Bush vs. Obama?  

The majority of the veterans being served are still Korean and Viet Nam veterans along with the first gulf war.
WMD were found under GW too.. There all clowns.. GW didn't produce his AF flight records and Obama probably isn't a citizen. Congress is the biggest clown of them all. Confused??? I am
MY partisanship?  Excuse me, dippy, the bill I'm referring to was BIPARTISAN.  You call it "bogus" in defense of your party of clowns in the Senate.  You're mentally ill.
Your partisanship discredits you. Have a good day.
"That bill was bogus" <--- LOL!!


That's right, you desperate left'tard.  Ignore the fact that it passed the House *overwhelmingly*
You're full of it.
What bigotry?
Making things up when don't have anything intelligent to say?
Idjiot.
She will say anything to defend obama.
Even more telling, wounded warriors coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan are not increasing treatment costs.

A congressional budget office report found that they cost $4,800 on average in 2010 compared to $8,800 for other veterans who used the system.

It also found that while they accounted for 7% of those who were treated, they were responsible for only 4% of its health costs.
Hope and change.
Hope this problem goes away,
Change the subject if not.
10 years?  The majority are Vietnam Vets, you silly child.


By the way, military casualties in Afghanistan under your Chicago Clown has far exceeded those under Bush.


Go cry.
Ray, please tell us MORE, we love to read your long winded screeds.
Dead vets are not "left over errors" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
VA stated Yesterday that they have MORE MONEY THAN THEY CAN USE = FAIL. (THey burned up their last budget buying FURNITURE.)
Typical Lib, ' Everybody does it' (I KNOW I sold you on voting for ME because I SAID I would be DIFFERENT - Hope & CHANGE)
How do you like something with an average wait time of 115 days!!!
LEGAL & AUTHORIZED housing allowances paid ONLY when government housing is NOT AVAILABLE.

Deal wtih it, Mikey.
Anecdotal - no actual proof, Mikey.
I cannot describe to you how I feel in totality about what the Bush and Obama administrations have done to America..

There is wickedness everywhere, especially the degenerate voting public who don't have a clue what to do or how to do it...There is just way too many of these useless Americans who support Obama, Holder, Hillary Clinton and the disgusting U.S. Congress...
These are LEGAL & AUTHORIZED housing payments paid only when government housing is not available.

It is actually cheaper to pay housing than build and maintain housing on base. 

An O6 is a Colonel (usually has about 20 -25 years in service.) 
Most dual married personnel do not get stations together at ever move.

The US Code notes that each as earned their own housing allowance, just as a differnt code note that each civil servant (like Mikey) has earn their own "locality pay."  Mikey drew a 25 % additional pay for 29 years because of where he was stationed - it counts for his retirement.  The military housing pay does not count for their retirement.  

Mikey has been shown stats that show that very few upper rank officers are dual married but yet claims there are hundres of thousands of them.  

Mikey hates the military because he blames it for all the failures in his 38 years on the government teat.
President is a little strong. Occupant I will agree with.
Who voted for Bush? I haven't been able to find them.
You think Romney would have been for Vets? He might have been for Vet generals but not for us.
Really, really filled with hatred and blaming the military for his 38 years of failures.
I'm a vet and it is hard to complain about health care that is free. The VA advises you to quit smoking and lose weight. If you don't want to care for yourself then they are less likely to try to support your careless habits, but overall they do a good job of wellness therapy.
Believed wtih no actual proof, just an anecdotal story?  Not to bright are you?
ok nig g a
ABC News/Washington Post poll:

"Only Watergate-plagued Richard Nixon had a worse rating than Mr. Obama at the same point of his presidency."


LOLOLOL
"George W. Bush still would have gotten more votes than Al Gore even if the U.S. Supreme Court hadn't halted the manual recount in Florida, according to a comprehensive analysis of uncounted ballots."

"In fact, Bush's 537-vote margin of victory would have increased to 1,665 under the ballot-counting standards Gore's supporters had advocated, according to a review.  -ABC News


Yet nearly 14 years later, you're still spouting stupid shllttt.  What a typical lefty loony you are.  HaHaHa
These conservatives stay in denial when it comes to Bush being the worst POTUS.
Yea he had a higher approval rating when he scammed his way into the White House after a miscount in his brother's state.
Your elected officials. Arizona is ran by your favorite party.
Who's in power?
Who did they fire? The guy that was going to retire anyway...yeah good one!
Why didn't your favorite party find any solutions to this problem, since there was a known problem? Seems like they are good for nothing too.
He don't even know what was untrue. That's the best lie he could come up with. He said he just found out about it! Seems like everybody just found out about since they are now firing people.
HaHaHa!!   What HASN'T your clown lied about?  He lies about everything.  It's so easy to see too unless you're a mentally ill ObamaBallLicker.


Remember the closing of war memorials and the sequestration lie?


1)  Sequestration was HIS idea


2)  It cost more to close the open-air war memorials than it did to leave them as is.


Your clown from Chicago is a sick boy.
me?


or the top level post, Bucky...?
That would be true.
I raised two daughters who did not become pregnant as teens.
O ran on fixing the problem, was also told by the transition team that there was a problem, so O saying he didn't know was not true.
It's called the do-nothing Senate. Not hard to figure out.
Way to stay on topic...lol.....
Barack Obama owes Sarah Palin an APOLOGY. 
 
She was right and Obama was wrong.
WRONG.  


GW Bush had a higher avg approval rating than your Chicago Clown does.
Where are my sources that there are no government run death panels? 
The burden of proof is on those of you who make this crap up.
Didn't Sarah Palin let the local hockey stud sleep over with her MINOR CHILD DAUGHTER - while Sarah was sleeping in the same house.....?

She could have been the first "White Trash president"
BTW...what's YOUR defense for the lack of 'leadership' among your Congressman on this or ANY issue?  I mean, cite me any sensible Bills they've passed that were good enough to get to the Oval Office for signing??  'Cause you KNOW had there been any your loud congressional reps would be all of FoxSnooze accusing him of....SOMEthing!  LOL,
Almost 5 years ago, Sarah Palin saw Obama's Death Panels for what they were.
Just found out meaning when?
What did he say that was untrue?
Nope.   GW Bush already holds that title and backed up by polls results showing 22% approval.  Lowest in American History.


But thanks for playing.


.
So back it up where are your sources?
My sister is a conservative, but at 28, I don't think she fantasizes about choir boys.
You and Sarah Palin have something in common, you are both white trash.
Bat Carter is breathing a sigh of relief. His legacy will just be bad not the worst!!!!
Hey, dumaz. There are no death panels, and the rationing of health care continues by private insurers.
The other day when he said he just found out about it!
Didn't Sarah Palin let the local hockey stud sleep over with her MINOR CHILD DAUGHTER - while Sarah was sleeping in the same house.....?



She could have been the first "White Trash president"
What did Obama lie about? Name one. Then tell us how that lie killed a vet.
There were about the same military casualties under Clinton.  And the military deaths in Afghanistan under your Chicago Clown has well exceeded those under Bush.
Sarah Palin on Obama's DEATH PANELS 
- August 7, 2009

As more Americans delve into the disturbing details of the nationalized health care plan that the current administration is rushing through Congress, our collective jaw is dropping, and were saying not just no, but hell no!

The Democrats promise that a government health care system will reduce the cost of health care, but as the economist Thomas Sowell has pointed out, government health care will not reduce the cost; it will simply refuse to pay the cost.

And who will suffer the most when they ration care? The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course.  The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obamas death panel so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their level of productivity in society, whether they are worthy of health care.

Such a system is downright evil.

 ...

Barack Obama lied and vets died.
Actually not quite.  The Veterans Benefits Administration is separate from the health care system.
Hater?
Worst President Ever
Hey, silly boy.  You might want to realize that Obama's appointee, Donald Berwick, said rationing care was inevitable.  Liberal go-to so-called economist, Paul Krugman, said death panels are the answer.  And yes, he used the term "death panel".
That's government run health care for ya!
Finishing papa bush's vendetta was worth more than 4000 dead active service members as far as regressive are concerned. 
Obama Lied. Vets Died.
Anyone who supports ObamaCare must be a fool
Does Obama owe her an apology for letting her run her stupid mouth and show how ign0rant she is?
We have free speech in this country. If Sarah wants to open her mouth and show what a m0r0n she is, she is free to do so.
Because conservatives fantasize about choir boys?
Wow what a comeback lefty...truth hurts? Guess you will be in shock come Nov!
just you.....
Isn't that funny. You quote a completely clueless rant by sarah pain er palin, then say Obama owes her an apology.
The ACA is not a government takeover of health care.
Obama puts thousands of troops on Death Panels. 
All Chris Christie did was close a bridge.
VERY TRUE!!  It means the most to Obama too.  Case in point:


Shinseki - bonus-driven gaming of the systems w/Vets suffering and dying.
Obama's response:  *probation*


Gen McChrystal - mildly criticized Obama during magazine interview.
Obama's response:  *fired*  Obama said he didn't uphold standards
only on talk radio, Bucky.....
Progressives fantasize about putting Tea Party members on Death Panels.
Good for you - my mistress is an Argentinian woman....
No many many people voted for O that's why the outcry O played lots of people and now has let them down because they now know they got played by the Most Divisive President in history.

As more Americans delve into the disturbing details of the nationalized health care plan that the current administration is rushing through Congress, our collective jaw is dropping, and were saying not just no, but hell no!

The Democrats promise that a government health care system will reduce the cost of health care, but as the economist Thomas Sowell has pointed out, government health care will not reduce the cost; it will simply refuse to pay the cost.

And who will suffer the most when they ration care? The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course.  The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obamas death panel so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their level of productivity in society, whether they are worthy of health care.

Such a system is downright evil.

 ...
Borat Obama owes Sarah Palin an apology.
Maybe it's because the "top" post in this sequence was:

"Perhaps Ben Carson should be offered the job?"



I went to Catholic school - we learned to read there - I'm assuming that you have been "home schooled"...
Obama's Ego is worth more than a few thousand dead Vets as far as Progressives are concerned.
And in case you want to know my wife is half black, just like Obama. You happy now troll?
Aaaaand how is that related to the VA?Deny, deflect  is that your MO?
Mac you don't get it. Sit in a waiting room of any Veterans system, you would find few vets have anything good to say about the service they get.  Even the VA's own IG, should have their heads on the chopping block, they are charged with watching to make sure this doesn't happen. I'm 45 years out of service and still fighting to fix problem that were untreated in Vietnam. To many of my friends have died at the hands of the VA.
Then I've sure asked the right person.......
Those pesky campaign promises....getting elected on promises is one thing. Making it work is another thing.
I don't know any vet that likes it. What kind of retarded statement is that?
I was quite amazed that Asians voted for Obama in almost the same % as did the Latinos.....


I had alway thought the Asians were somewhat conservative - but I guess they still feel the string of being discriminated against for so many generations....
Do I have any friends of color? Dumbest question ever....
The lack of reason and logic on the Left never ceases to amaze me.
I did not know that the VA is under the congress??? Having said that I think that the current house and senate are a bunch of useless bastards
Would you now like a cookie for that statement.  He may not answer you but I will.  I also have friends of many colors also.
Pointing out that Sarah Palin is ill-equipped to even be a city council woman is not a war on women. Sarah Palin ran to be vice president, yet did not know that we are allied with South Korea and not North Korea. 
Christine Todd Whitman, Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Nancy Pelosi, Kathleen Sebelius, and a good number of other women have earned my respect as politicians. Sarah Palin? not so much.
Give it a rest. While Palin was unfairly treated by the Press she has been an embarrassment to her party and our country. Best if she retires to Alaska and works with the native population to rebuild her brand.
I have black friends, brown friends, yellow friends, red friends.


Do you have ANY friends of color....?
Didn't Sarah Palin let the local hockey stud sleep over with her MINOR CHILD DAUGHTER - while Sarah was sleeping in the same house.....?


"White trash" where I come from....
Whats your fascination between white and black? Are you gay or what?
And the war on women continues but not by Rep but by Democrats LOL
How is that all related to the VA fiasco? You have now talked about everything from Palin to Polar bears. Man grow a pair and man up
Sarah Pain er Palin wouldn't know what a VA center is, nor would she comprehend that people who go to war get wounded.
to take them out of the hands of the insurance companies......?
Wait - aren't there built-in inefficiencies and bureaucratic failures in any large, centralized organization? Consider the (former) USSR's command economy, or the US Post Office's ability to adapt to change.  Why should healthcare - the doctor to patient relationship - be managed at the mercy of a huge bureaucracy? Why not give Veterans subsidies and let them choose in the private market for healthcare?
The lying and playing everyone like a chump because he thinks he is the smartest guy in the room, or how about his divesive politics!
you like most of the  Obama mice seem to want to change the past instead of the present or future. Until they invent a time machine, no one can go back in time 10, 20 or 70 years ago, like your ridiculous statement. President Obama has had control since 2008, and was aware of the problem and even campaigned that he would change it. Yet here we are TODAY listening to his excuse that he learned about the problem from watching tv. Accept the simple fact that while you can try and defend your idol by pointing your fingers at other times and presidents and try and avoid the or hide the fact that Obama has once again failed to show leadership.
Stop using the race thing we are better then the Progressive Liberals.
I dont know, I dont hate him. I just dont like his policies.
A White President would have the decency to apologize to Sarah Palin.
then YOU explain the "visceral hatred" to me.....
Most Americans did you dolt. Thats why he won twice. Obama sucks
buwahahahaha...if everything else fails blame it on race
I do


I know a  half-dozen places with killer fried chicken.....
What is your point? We shouldn't be upset with the VA? 
This isn't a partisan problem this is a systemic bureaucracy problem. The people in charge are more concerned about looking good because that is what the measure for bonuses is. 
I know the VA  does a good job once you start receiving care. 
The problem is getting in to receive care.
Didn't she used to bonk Glenn Rice...?


You know - the tall, black NBA player with the real big hands......
Obama's Death Panels were put there for this very reason.
Does Michelle Obama eat fried chicken?
Do you think she ever calls out Glenn Rice's name when she's with her husband....?
I use Tricare myself and I also try not to get within 100 miles of a VA facility
Sarah Palin was RIGHT about Obama's Death Panels.
Progressives owe Sarah an APOLOGY.
Yes they do. But the problem is actually receiving that service. If you cant get medical attention for 6-12 months or just ignored all together. They can have the best medical care in the world  but if you cant get in it makes no difference...
And You cant argue with the comment by "Robert" 
"Want to know what government health care will be like?? Ask a vet."
How negligent is it to believe the Federal Government will do any better with Obamacare when they cant even take care of our soldiers?

You know that is not a bad idea. I think that it should be their benefit package. Take away their medicare and place them into the VA system. That is something I will have to think on.
These brave Vets gave up limbs, blood and their sanity to protect us, and Obama goes and puts them on Death Panels.
 
That's how much Obama cares about decent folk - NOT AT ALL.

Obama and the rest of His Progressive Cult owe Sarah Palin an apology.
They should be executed for treason.
Well Halliburton is a Public company,  so it is not "Cheney's" company.  He earned $0.00 from them during (and for a good period before) he became VP.  100% of ALL stock options during his tenure were donated to charity so that he made $0. His donations during his terms are easily found. Maybe you want to go look at them.   Then look up Bite Me Biden donations to charity.   
Sarah Palin tried to warn us about Obama's Death Panels way back in 2009.
CNN massages Obama's balls in worship.
Obama's IQ is 102, so He's plenty smart enough to know His plans include Death Panels.
The Progressive Cult is incapable of finding fault in their God Obama.
I don't believe it is arrogance, it is ignorance.

You may be technically correct in a most narrow, naive and hence meaningless sense.


During his actual term as VP, Cheney did not receive a salary from Halliburton, and his stock ownings were supposedly in a "blind" trust, per protocol.


However, I doubt you're naive enough not to see the well-known "revolving doors" for those who work for the war corporations => high office => lobbyists => neocon chickenhawk think-tanks => and the Fox-RNC apparatus.


Bottom line is Cheney and his friends and associates lobbied hard for a war in Iraq for many years before 9/11, finally got what they wanted, and profited very well from it in direct and indirect ways throughout the years 2000 to now.
Sarah Palin was right, but Obama is just too arrogant to admit it.
rb,,, Let me guess,,, you're on welfare and don't/refuse to work,,, Right ?? How's that working for you ????
Then why even bother commenting on it ? What do Unicorns offend you as well ?
Atheists such as myself don't believe in god.
Yep lets take advice from someone who can't hold down a job  lol
Yep. Do some research before you post.
Seriously? LMAO
Claim it, own it.
Everybody knows he doesn't get bad news until the press breaks it.
Look it up for yourself
And what exactly at that time did he say was wrong with it...other than long waiting times? Which was known to every president BEFORE him..lol

Sarah Palin claims Barack Obama runs a 'death panel'

Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, urged her supporters to oppose Democratic plans for health care reform on her Facebook page.

	"As more Americans delve into the disturbing details of the nationalized health care plan that the current administration is rushing through Congress, our collective jaw is dropping, and were saying not just no, but hell no!" wrote Palin in  a note  posted Aug. 7, 2009.

	She said that the Democrats plan to reduce health care costs by simply refusing to pay for care.

	"And who will suffer the most when they ration care? The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course. The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil."
I don't recall him saying anything about 1000's being denied care and dying from it. Show me where he said that.
He should have, otherwise he is unqualified for the position.
It's been all over the news.  The video of Obama promising to fix the VA.  At least six years ago.  Where have you been?
Didn't he campaign on this saying he was going to fix the VA?
Liar. Obama CAMPAIGNED on this very issue WAAAYYYY back in 2007. He knew, he promised, but he LIED AGAIN.
Progressives Cultists would never fault their God Obama, so they will find any excuse to ignore this.
The VA is part of the executive branch.  And as such he is the "boss".
And as the boss it is his responsibility to make sure the folks working for him are telling him the truth and not doctoring the numbers.  
And while it is certainly at too low a level for him to always be aware, as the boss it is his job to establish a climate within his organization that doesn't hide things to look good--as much as the boss may want to look good.
So are you trying to say he knew about this 6 years ago?  LOL
Obama is president and He promised to fix it years ago.
What, you're saying you dont know Mitt was RIGHT ?....LMFAO...how ignorant are you ?
It will be a cold day in HELL before Progressives will admit their God Obama lied.
We'd see some action on this if Obama and Shinseki had to wait in line to see their doctors.
Of the Executive Branch dear.
For what? LMAO
He also owes one to Romney.
Of the military dear.
Because you're saying that since Bush is gone, he has no blame in this either.  It's been going on for decades so multiple Presidents have done nothing.  Maybe we should all start looking at the common denominator, Congress.  *Signed a vet also waiting for his claim to go through*
Barack Obama owes Sarah Palin an APOLOGY, but He's just too arrogant.
They are the only ones who CAN bring charges against these people.
He's their boss and the buck stops with him.
He's is the Commander in Chief. Top dog, head honcho ect.
lol
It's time for Shinseki to man up and move on.  His dream of following in Inouye's footsteps as senator from Hawaii are over too.
Obama isn't the one that lied and covered up all those lists.
Carter agrees!  
He's no longer in last place!
Every one who voted for Obama, based on his race...is a racist themselves....
Obama Lied. Vets Died.
 
When will Progressives stop worshipping their God Obama?
Anyone who thinks bush was better should be in serious counseling for mental defects...
My husband is ex military and won't step foot in a VA Hospital due to their incompetency.  The ones who go there usually have no alternative.
That maybe true but you also have to remember he was voted in on his skin color.
A little more retaliation from the Obama administration should get them back in line.
The color of Obamas skin has nothing to do with his incompetence.
They're already back to it.
CNN is just hoping for some random lifevest to wash up on the shore so they can switch back tot he airliner story and cover up this for Obama.
Because everything was better with a White President.
Not in the least..Why?
Miss Bush yet?
Obama is a Liar.
 
He will NOT fix this problem, just like He hasn't fixed anything.
Obama worshippers will never fault their God Obama, even though He's clearly the Worst President in History.
Obama Lied, Vets Died.
 
Sarah Palin was RIGHT about Death Panels.
doesn't everyone?
Progressives dream about killing their political opponents.
I sit on the death panel that she created.  I'm afraid your name is on it :(
Sarah Palin was RIGHT about Death Panels but Obama was just too proud to listen.
Not so.
How about all presidents since the founding of the VA?
After the Revolutionary War payments promised by Congress to disabled veterans were left up to the states, and only a few thousand of those who served ever received anything, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

"left up to the states" - good luck with that one - even today.....
54321 blame bush...
blame some one...not obama?
how much does obama pay you?
Don't expect anyone from this administration to accept responsibility for anything.  There's a long history of that,
what he meant was time may change me but I can't change time
the real issue with things like the VA are funding.
make all VA employees use VA healthcare system themselves and only VA healthcare system - as condition of contiued employment - problem solved instantly and saves money too - now what do people think about that idea? no m,ore gov for me but not for you crp
Your right, there has been problems for years.  Also remember that WWII, Korean, and Vietnam vets are at the age where their health risks are at the greatest.  This was something that could/should have been planned for.  When Desert Storm started it should have been known and planned for another increase, and the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq also should have been known to add load to the system.  This is what Washington is supposed to do, plan for known expenses and hope you budget enough extra for unknowns.  Not plan how to position your party to do well in the next election.
Moron, the Tea Party and Libertarians (two entirely different groups from the GOP) have never remotely been in power, and never had any opportunity to fix the VA system.  


If you are a soldier as you claim, then the VA hospital system clearly failed to fix your severe mental retardation, since you turn a story about the present failure of the VA under Obama into some idiot rant about two groups who don't have any sway on this issue.  (Nor were either of them around back in 1971)
It's not just older vets dying. Young vets are not being properly treated for PTSD and other medical issues and are committing suicide at an alarming rate. 
Please provide your statistical data and source because your are LYING. 
You do not speak for all vets either. Are you even a vet? Do you have ANY idea what VA health care is like or how hard it is to get an appointment, from PERSONAL experience?  "The lack of reason and logic..." Are you kidding me? Your desire to take a vet's comment about the overall discontent of VA health care and to be condescending, is indicative of a desperate attempt to appear intellectually superior.  Suggestion: Get over yourself. 
Yes we do. The VA even calls me days ahead of time to remind me about my appointments.
It would be good for partisans of both Parties to read Machiavelli's "The Prince," which speaks of the power of dividing two groups so that a third maintains all the power.
Until Veterans recognize that groups like Concerned Vets of America and Vote Vets place their partisan agendas above all else, Veterans will continue to be a tool in a political game.

The result will be predictable, whichever group prevails; sadly Veterans will come out last - again.
If "numbers" were the real problem, most Veterans would not be in an uproar.
The source of our anger is the absolute nastiness, arrogance and misrepresentations made by V.A. managers in every level of the system.
I assure you, there ARE genuine, competent and compassionate employees within the V.A.  BUT many work under an atmosphere of intimidation and retaliation if they so much as open their mouth about even miniscule problems.
Do you really believe that 2500 Veterans received colonoscopies that were performed without the tubing being sterilized, without at least one nurse/tech questioning the process?
I seriously doubt it.
More than likely, those who recognized the problem were shut down, transferred or made so miserable that they quit.
I've personally seen what happens when one makes an effort to utilize the Chain of Command in the V.A.  - Retaliation.
Because Republics running against them will use this as a Campaign issue when they can easily fund the VA properly and have taken care of our Veterans over the last 20 years...INSTEAD OF ABUSING THEM AS POLITICAL TOOLS.
Nobody is saying ALL vets are unhappy with the care they're getting at the VA.  And how dare you minimize the atrocious way too many of our veterans were treated.  
What about those that voted for George W. Bush twice? Do they have any better "reason or logic"? No, they certainly do not.
So is my husband.  Does that mean that vets don't deserve quality healthcare for their time served...in ANY capacity?
Open your eyes.  VA medicine is third world medicine.  If a vet is happy with the VA it's because he  doesn't know anything about medicine.
The Big Three are back and  in Laden dines with the fishes.
wow, the inverse of your statement is no less true then, correct?  I'm a healthcare administrator for ambulatory outpatient care.  We try to help vets get VA benefits daily.  It is a horrible system to maneuver.  If they qualify, medicaid in our state is much better run and is recommended over the VA.  Private insurance, if available, trumps both.
All it takes to be completely happy with something is for it to have every feature you want, and be paid for entirely with other peoples' money.  That doesn't sound impossible.  That's just what a lot of people want and think they deserve.
All
s, I agree.  I think VA is a very good system, consider it is free.  I don't why people are weining so much about it.  I have been in the VA's care for the past 8 years. A+.
So?   a fair amount of folks have had some trigger time who only rate a campaign medal, an expeditionary medal or have drawn HFP or wear a CAB, CIB, NDSM, or even more an OSI-FWTS..which doesn't mean they haven't been in the mix or risked their bacon...even the REMF's have taken mortar rounds on more than a few occasions nowadays!  What's the point?
Neither, one thIng is for certain, U R A D!CK!!!!
No, he's simply pointing out that people who for voted for Obama twice are unlikely to be people who voted for Bush twice.
Sorry all decisions of our JUDGES  are final!  Maybe tommorow!
Dont forget... o does plenty without congress whenever it suits him.
I DEMAND A RECOUNT.... IN FLORIDA!!!
Gee! Really? Who'd a thunk a huge government military bureaucracy wasn't ALL combat personnel? You must be REALLY smart!
I believe you.
Every word I penned is true, unfortunately. 
Do you know that the vast majority of vets ARE NOT combat decorated?
Abuse and fraud and waste in the government system?

Say it ain't so!
Why are you so angry? Because you are on the government dole and all the big kids got to go into combat and you didn't?
If you want to stop another exhibition of abuse in the massively bloated DOD and VA healthcare systems, then STOP permitting female military dependents from abusing their US taxpayer funded provided healthcare by having surrogate pregnancies for money!

Each year there are THOUSANDS of dependents who are blatantly abusing their US taxpayer provided health care to contract their bodies FOR CASH to have children for foreign nationals and others via surrogate pregnancies off the backs of the US taxpayers. 

And I KNOW what I am talking about. We even had wives of highly paid Navy officers participating in this garbage!

From a prior "business manager" in an OB GYN Dept at a DOD health care facility. And a prior Section Chief in the IRS's CFO Office. 
Why are you afraid?
REAGAN IS NOT PRESIDENT NOW,MORON!!!!!OBAMMY SUCKS!!!
Every word I penned is true. And every single figure I cited is 100% accurate. You can google these tables yourself to verify all of this $21 BILLION PER YEAR entitlement festering tax free gravy train that 99% of the general US population knows anything about. 
Are you on that kick again little one? ARE YOU PUNK?
Do you even know that the vast majority of vets, INCLUDING ME, are not combat decorated?

Tell you what, we'll reduce the military to ONLY those who will serve in combat and see just how far they get.
I am in full agreement with both the prior and current SECDEF's public statements declaring that the all volunteer military has vastly bloated personnel costs that are "unsustainable." And here's one facet of those vastly bloated costs that everyone can relate to.

I just checked the DOD travel site to see the new "BAH" (or basic allowance for housing) tables for 2014. They were just increased ON AVERAGE by an incredible 5%. Some locations, including no less that tropical vacation destination for many- HawaiiI, were increased by a whopping 15% AND MORE! And in 2013 they were ALSO INCREASED by 3.8% on average as well!

For those of you who do not know, these monthly allowances (that in actuality are tax free handouts) for optional off-ship or off-base 'housing' needs for military volunteers are (a) tax free; (b) above and beyond base pays, other pays, and other tax free allowances; and (c) require no proof whatsoever that they are even being used for optional off-ship or off-base 'housing.'

Here's a small sample of these staggering figures by 4 cites and 3 ranks for "dual married' military couples (when two members marry each other, including homosexual couples) with 1 dependent:

Washington, DC:
Two married E-3s*: $3,612
Two married E-7s**: $4,608
Two married O-6s***: $5,919

San Diego:
Two married E-3s: $3,552
Two married E-7s: $4,608
Two married O-6s: $5,553

Honolulu, HI
Two married E-3s: $4,563
Two married E-7s: $6,060
Two married O-6s: $7,778

San Francisco, CA
Two married E-3s: $5,709
Two married E-7s: $7,116
Two married O-6s: $8,949

* E-3s are typically 18/19 years old, GED or HS educated, wiith 1 year in the military since moving out of their parent's homes.

** E-7s are the same as above but add 10-12 years

*** Essentially all 'dual married' O-6 couples are already being paid cumulatively from $220,000-$280,000 per year in combined base pays, other pays, and other tax free allowances. And all other lower ranked dual married officer couples are being paid from $125,000-$250,000 per year!

Every word cited above is true. And every eye-popping and absurd figure is fully accurate that was taken right from the "2014 BAH Tables."

The culture of entitlement is alive and well in our nation's all volunteer military. DOD ought to be ashamed of itself for this $21 BILLION per year tax free monthly GRAVY TRAIN that 99% of the general US population knows anything about (until now)! 

Contact your members of Congress today to get this preposterous $21 billion per year and growing waste stopped.

Single payer system is the only one that will work...not this watered down version forced on us.
You sound pretty delusional. You are not going to get a gun and go after blond schoolgirls for rejecting you are you?

First thing in the morning, call you psychiatrist and ask him to up your meds. The current level is not working.
Racism
The frequently and worn out word used by liberals when truth and facts elude them.

How typical of a liberal
How pathetic.
Yes, we liberals want a dysfunctional and corrupt socialized medicine program so we can take over the country.
please dont make a complete liberal of urself in public !!
Because freedom!
More racist blather....
Are ju gay? And brain damaged?
Probably......
Ditto.
Benghazi?
does that excite u ?
Run away, little one. You are very much out of your depth and league with me.  Run away.
Hillary has now brain damage. That and the VA scandal...why would anyone vote for the Democraps?
OUTRAGEOUS!
He should be arrested.
Single payer (VA style) is the plan liberals have been working on. Obamacare is just an interim step.
Most Vets needing treatment  are from Vietnam and Korea.

You know, those unnecessary wars that Dems FORCED young people to die?
good for u !
and honesty is hard to come by
So thats why vets are waiting 6 month for care? Dumb lying liberal. This has been going on for years under this regime.
XGOTTS ARE LIB CHIC! UNTIL THE NEXT CAUSE CELEB COMES ALONG!!!
Are you THAT stupid?
More bonuses for union workers that have been reprimanded for poor performance.
Everything. 
yep, so does big corporation = big money = big problems. just to keep you honest.
So the VA problem is caused by Kennedy . Johnson?
HA HA HA
The VA had a 500 Million surplus at the end of 2013. What do you want to spend more money on? The fat salaries of these VA admins?
Did you intend for that to make sense?
Nothing
I personally know of no one who is stupid enough to believe that. Nonetheless, they volunteered, they were promised healthcare, they served doing what I wouldn't want to do. I would bet that most of the combat decorated grunts appreciated at least some of the non-combat veterans. Sound like you have a chip on your shoulder. Get over it loser.
CLEAN BILL D....HEAD,CLEAN BILL!
Therefore:
Big Government=Big Money
Yep, our math is good!
You mean Kennedy, Johnson?
You do not know what you are talking about!

Nope!

OBAMA DUNG EATER
Pick a different job then!
The myth that joining the mil is akin to fighting in combat and putting ones life on the line. For a relative few it can be true. But for the vast majority who sit behind desks in DOD office BLDGS it's an insult to the relative few combat decorated grunts!
Obama renews pledge to get to bottom of IRS scandal
Illegals, prisoners and gays get better health care under Obama, than our vets.
As a current reservist (25 years both active and reserve) now working at the VA, I am FORCED to use the VA (FEHB) insurance and can NOT use Tricare. It's crap :(
America has had it with fake scandals it looks like. Fox News' ratings were down 27% in May.
No. They were promised healthcare. 
OBAMA DUNG EATER slrp, slurp, good doggie
And your point is...? 
Not at all. Most join with GEDs and HS diplomas as office support staff from their mommy and daddy's houses to run away from min wage jobs!  Are you that clueless?
What myth?
Manufactured scandals are not really scandals....
I.E. Benghazi.....
You make it sound like a bad thing!!!!!
So your an expert are you?  Great, then get off your duff and do something about this issue.. If not, I don't honestly care what your opinion is.
Racism ahhhhhhh...racism ahhhhh
Big money = big problems.
and drag Reid and Pelosi by the short hairs behind them!!!!
Scandals, really you are sick of scandals, then you need to find another pastime other than following the news.
You are BS, thats all you got fat boy?
The vast majority NEVER SPENT A SECOND IN COMBAT, and especially so the lifers!
Irrelevant to my post regarding illegal aliens, do you get it?
BS--
Funny you should mention fecal matter.  Bush was full of it.
So most never served in combat. Kinda takes a bit of the myth away doesn't it?
Shinsekie resign ! And take Obama and Holder with you. We have had it with scandals!
no like those liberals beating up returning soldiers in airport bathrooms all in the name of"peace",moron!!!!
So do prisoners, lazy people, and just about everyone else...
So?
Are you aware that relatively few vets or active duty are combat decorated?
Big government = Big Problems
No illegals,liberals and minorities like you
Illegals get better care under Obama than our vets! And Obama wants to add another 17 Million parasites to our bloated system.
See and READ my post above!  Are you even aware that relatively few volunteers opt for combat arms ( do you even know what this is) or are combat decorated?  Turn off your Fox TV channel and start thinking for yourself and GET OVER YOUR FEARS!
In denial, are we?
And i want to put all generalists on the waiting list.
And the Michigan and Minnesota Senators?

Where is Stewart Smaley?
Buwahahahaha
You are as dumb as your dumb avatar.
Try, at least TRY responding with at least a modicum of intelligence to my substantive and fact-based post and drop this fear-based stupid stuff! 
How about a clean bill w/ no dumpocrap pork then we'll see who votes against it,moron!!!!!
Yeah right--you're a Democrat like my cats a dog
Deliberate gaming, with bonuses attached, at the expense of Vets suffering & dying has nothing to do w/funding.

Secondly, the budget has doubled the last decade.


Lastly, Congress was in charge of a VA Accountability bill last week.  It passed overwhelmingly in the House.  Senate Democrats blocked it.
Read my post dummy
Wow,
Comprehension issues?
Its being investigated in 24 states. Try to keep up with the news..liberal
You may not want to vote Republican again either - This has happened under both parties watches.
Of course you would, but some do not believe that the VA budget is a waste.
That's all they know.
Throw money at a problem when it's failed for 20 years
Lincoln was a true conservative, that is why he was for emancipation. It was the Christian conservatives who were abolitionists not the Democrats. It was the Democrats who owned slaves, it was Democrats that created the KKK and Democrats that voted in Jim Crow laws and Dems that were against equal rights.
Cool story
Are you high or drunk?
This is outrageous. I will never vote Democratic again.
He should keep an eye on what happens in his home state, especially since he is a Veteran.
Ahhh are you angry that you are losing again. so sad...sniff
Yea so McCain is in charge of the VA, dummy?
VA budget has increased 87% since 2008. At the end of 2013, they had 500 Million surplus. Yet liberals want to blame congress for not wasting more money. Typical
They're in charge of the money--look it up
So congress is in charge of the VA. Interesting....
Your levelheadedness and proper historical context has no place here! ... But I agree with you on that.
Aaaand how is that related to Obama's failures, dimwit?
Brought to you by the folks who brought Obamacare...enjoy
CRYING RACISM IS THE LAST REFUGE OF A SCOUNDREL AND THE 1ST REFUGE OF A LIBERAL!!!
Take another look at these numbers.
Yea sure dimwit. Even the Democraps are calling for him to resign.
interesting you should go there. Since 1971 there has been 19 sessions of congress. Of the 19 sessions, democrats have controlled the house and senate in 14 of them. Which if my math is correct, that is 74% of the time. 74% is not just a majority of the time, but a VAST majority of time. So using your own statement with true numbers your post should actually read '"there has been a vast majority of chance to fix it, but the dems would rather do nothing and blame others than own the fact that they have had three times the opportunity to fix the bad joke than the republicans. Things that make you go hummmm
U R A D!CK!!!!
No thanks, that helps our active duty...not hurts.
As well BAh can vanish if you go out on ship. so you know little of it.

All for nixing officer pay, but name me ten couples of married O'6 you can't.

22 years in never knew more than 8 married enlisted couples.
AND WELFARE CRACK HEADS DON'T PAY TAXES AND GET A 30% INCREASE IN FOOD STAMPS ! OUR PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY ARE SPECIAL NOT DREGS LIKE TOOTHLESS CRACKHO'S!!!
Translation: Mike J. Smith is a lonely old man who wants someone to talk to to keep the demons of his disappointing life at bay for a few more hours. Attacking the military will get him the attention he craves!
Oh dear.....your mental fatigue persists.  Can you hear me?  It is 2014 and the country is socialist.  Bush is retired, has been for over half a decade.  Get someone to read you the paper, maybe it will help.
And mindless union work rules.
Feel free to take advantage of this benefit. Move your family every few years, risk getting your limbs blown off. Then get back to us with this horrible injustice. 
The same research will also tell you that most yetis are satisfied with their wireless carriers, and chupacabra prefer AquaFresh.
If it is as simple as doing the math why are they hiding the results?  What ever happened to taking problems head on?  Political babies and cowards who value their own positions over the operation of medical services for our veterans.  I don't care who takes that cowardly position; they are unworthy Americans, the President included, if they do not confront this and resolve it like yesterday.
U R A D!CK!!!!!
UNION PENSION FUNDS AND OVERTIME!
I am in full agreement with both the prior and current SECDEF's public statements declaring that the all volunteer military has vastly bloated personnel costs that are "unsustainable." And here's one facet of those vastly bloated costs that everyone can relate to.

I just checked the DOD travel site to see the new "BAH" (or basic allowance for housing) tables for 2014. They were just increased ON AVERAGE by an incredible 5%. Some locations, including no less that tropical vacation destination for many- HawaiiI, were increased by a whopping 15% AND MORE! And in 2013 they were ALSO INCREASED by 3.8% on average as well!

For those of you who do not know, these monthly allowances (that in actuality are tax free handouts) for optional off-ship or off-base 'housing' needs for military volunteers are (a) tax free; (b) above and beyond base pays, other pays, and other tax free allowances; and (c) require no proof whatsoever that they are even being used for optional off-ship or off-base 'housing.'

Here's a small sample of these staggering figures by 4 cites and 3 ranks for "dual married' military couples (when two members marry each other, including homosexual couples) with 1 dependent:

Washington, DC:
Two married E-3s*: $3,612
Two married E-7s**: $4,608
Two married O-6s***: $5,919

San Diego:
Two married E-3s: $3,552
Two married E-7s: $4,608
Two married O-6s: $5,553

Honolulu, HI
Two married E-3s: $4,563
Two married E-7s: $6,060
Two married O-6s: $7,778

San Francisco, CA
Two married E-3s: $5,709
Two married E-7s: $7,116
Two married O-6s: $8,949

* E-3s are typically 18/19 years old, GED or HS educated, wiith 1 year in the military since moving out of their parent's homes.

** E-7s are the same as above but add 10-12 years

*** Essentially all 'dual married' O-6 couples are already being paid cumulatively from $220,000-$280,000 per year in combined base pays, other pays, and other tax free allowances. And all other lower ranked dual married officer couples are being paid from $125,000-$250,000 per year!

Every word cited above is true. And every eye-popping and absurd figure is fully accurate that was taken right from the "2014 BAH Tables."

The culture of entitlement is alive and well in our nation's all volunteer military. DOD ought to be ashamed of itself for this $21 BILLION per year tax free monthly GRAVY TRAIN that 99% of the general US population knows anything about (until now)! 

Contact your members of Congress today to get this preposterous $21 billion per year and growing waste stopped.
iF HE HASN'T DONE HIS JOB UP TO NOW WHAT MAKES YOU THINK HE'LL START NOW?!! KINDA LIKE OBAMMY!
Doesn't matter. If it wasn't bush it would be someone else. They still wouldn't own up to anything. They don't have it in them.
One solution...get rid of it. Send them to the only healthcare that works...the private system.
Let me take a wild guess who you voted for..........
U R A D!CK!!!!!!
And I can't help but wonder, if it were a private insurance company/medical facility behaving the same way, would you be making excuses for them? Would you trade your integrity to protect those greedy devils?
As many as 60 vets found dead in a morgue over an 18 month period?!!!  Are they that incompetent  that the dead are piling up and have to hide them! ' Over there, under here, under there, every where ...so beware say..... a prayer!' America,this is our future!
Sure, downplay it. The principle of the entire thing is completely meaningless, right? Honesty and straightforwardness are just silly 50s TV pipe dreams of the past, just like promises, right? Are you REALLY a vet?
WITH YOUR NOSE UP OBAMMY'S @$$WHY DON'T YOU LICK HIS KNUTSAC ?!!!!!
GET YOUR NOSE OUT OF OBAMMY'S @$$ FOR A BETTER VIEW!  IF NOT YOU MIGHT AS WELL LICK HIS KNUTSAC WHILE YOU'RE DOWN THERE, XGGOT! !
BLUE STATE STUPIDITY!
You are making the claim, so you should substantiate it.
General Shinseki is that you?
Not sure what scoreboard you're looking at, but clearly sitting in the "Away" section has distorted your perception of the game. This hoopla and constant scandal and sensationalism media environment has you tuned up about nothing. Sorry, but the Republicans will have stolen 8 years of salary and probably untold billions more without contributing one bead of sweat towards solving any problems before this is all over. In fact, they've done everything within their power to block any sort of progress remotely possible. You want a healthcare system that was primed, optimized right out of the gate? Ask your Republicans why that didn't happen. Instead, we got what was absolutely necessary to get a foot in the door...something to spend more time and money fixing. Everywhere I look, I see the same uphill battle against treasonous corporate sponsored Republicans feeding off of the American people. 
True, objective research will show Vets have problems with the care and do not trust the VA.
I asked my dad how he was affected by the VA problems, and he said "what problems?".  Some people are actually quite happy with what they are getting.
Nope he inherited his first term ills from W.
His second term he inherited from himself.
LOL.  @disqus_z858v9kuto:disqus That is a straight up lie.  VA is bad and has been bad for so long that they even made a movie in 90s? About it (Article 99).
Just doing my job.
Stop smoking that reefer and pick up your local newspaper you hermit.
Like most Americans liked their healthcare???
And it's a rip-off for the veteran himself/herself.  You don't have to be disabled to use VHA.  No claim necessary, no service-connected condition at all.  TriCare after service is for the families.  Many can do better, anyway.
The ones still living, or the ones died waiting?
NOPE.  That won;t work.  THIS President claims he knew NOTHING of the problem and "is made as hell".  Yet as a candidate for President he made a pledge to the Vets to fix the VA.  He can't have it both ways.
He either KNOWS nothing (about anything all the time) or failed to deliver on his pledge and RAISE the issue to the country when the GOP said "no money".  But he was silent.
This is Obama's mess for a failure to take any action of any kind at any time.
This President claims he did not know and he is "made as hell".  He could have spent the money he wasted on ACA on the VA.  He is going to build another gov't agency to run ACA and yet can't run the VA.
Ever heard of TriCare?  Like private.  It's the government's promise of 'free health care for life' for retirees, you just have to pay for it...
The gov't has the responsibility for supplying Vets with healthcare.  Just as your ridiculous assumption that ACA is going to be responsible for supplying healthcare coverage and is going to operate any better.  Many Vets have few options due to the severe nature of their injuries and handicap.  
The only ignorance of the problems is with Obama (who while campaigning made a pledge to the Vets), his administration (that wasted time on ACA) and YOU who believe that our Vets do not deserve better than the run around they have been receiving.
Proud to say I have never and will never go to the VA...commonsense, it has always been garbage...Once you retire or rotate back to the world, get private insurance...NEXT!
Why go to the VA...get private insurance, cheapskate.
Thanks for your service!
Robert's assessment is very accurate. Your statement is rooted in mistruths and disinformation.
call your congressman and tell the GOP to fund vets..stop cutting, cutting cost lives
When we can actually get an appointment.
Yes we do.  It is fantastic.
Yes I am.
Remember when Shinseki was just confirmed ...the Obama Administration 
floated the idea of euthanasia for critically ill Veterans that was 
about the time when  former Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano put Veterans on the terrorist watch like.
You KNOW ohbozo doesn't give a rat's patoot about veterans.
Step away from the crack pipe.  It's rotting your brain.
So you were an intern and a nobody. Got it.
Still waiting to hear how that is relevant?
You mindless lemming Rs are surely driven by fear that's for sure!   Boooooo!
Grammar dude!
Utter nonsense!
Give it a rest already.
I don't think death panels.   But more like who you know.
Remember when Shinseki was just confirmed ...the Obama Administration floated the idea of euthanasia for critically ill Veterans that was about the time when they put Veteran on the terrorist watch like.
Not relevant, Mikey.
President Obama is far from being a bad President too. He's played the hand that he was dealt as well as anyone could. I seriously feared he too would share the distinctions of Kennedy and Lincoln before finishing his term. People are deluded to think that we won't see such a thing again. Illusions of civility. The animals are getting restless...and armed. 
Really?  Please look at the GOP voting record in Congress to support your argument.
Ahahahaha 
Yeah, like Dubya did? Pffffft!
Progressives support murderous criminals.
 
Conservatives support honorable vets.
Are you combat decorated?
Sarah Palin is RIGHT off the charts of any known intelligence.
your daddy in chief is a stinking pig
your anger disturbs me.....
Sarah Palin was RIGHT (again). 
ObamaCare = Death Panels
Serious question, did your parents have any kids who lived.
You were incharge of the coffee and xeroxing papers.  You have never been in a position of any real authority, Binky Boy.
Only if it makes him look good................
75% of Lesbians are Obese. Coincidence?
Sure you did. Questions like: do you want cream in you coffee? And Would you like me to pull the car up, Sir?

What is a neocon you failure?
bite me
suck a dik, hmo.
Utter reposted from YOUR VERY OWN POSTS.  

Deal with it, Mikey

Should have learned to keep your mouth shut and your fingers off the keyboard, little man. 
Shut the f up.
Remember Democrats: YOU FORCED THESE DEATH PANELS ON US!!
Point instead to the guy that caused them...
In 2003, then-VA Secretary Anthony Principi stopped allowing any more group 8 enrollments, saying their numbers strained the system for higher priority veterans, including wounded returning from Afghanistan and Iraq.
As if Obama even CARES about a few thousand dead troops...
Utter crapola! 
Proof of failure: 

1.)  job hopped: 4 jobs in 8 years
2.)  believes a 2 year paid internship that no one fails is important
3.)  Ended his civil service "career" (term applied very loosely) at the same GS 13 he began as. 
4.)  Failed 1,000 consecutive times to get hired in a single 3 year period.
5.)  actually lists "law school" on his resule when he only completed a single semester 
6.)  lists that he was "accepted" at a university yet never enrolled, took a single course, nor graduated and believes this was important enough to post year after year on these very boards.
Are you an "honorable vet" Michelle...or just spouting off against Obama?
If it wasn't for FOXNews, CNN and the rest of the press would have covered this up for the Progressive God Obama.
Well that is a color blind equation. The military industrial complex doesn't care about white or brown, only green.
Obama doesn't give a f--k about vets. He just cares about Himself.
Just a thought for my GOP buffoons==>Private partnerships only work when the government is paying contractors  crap loads of money, preferably in service of bombing brown people.
Death Panels are part of Obama's plan.
Nah... 35 is too high. Pushing 20.
obama will throw this guy under the bus as soon as the document destruction is done.
Corrupt POS
What's a few thousand dead Vets, we're talking about Obama's LEGACY, after all?
The Clown-in-Chief addressed the graduating class at West Point earlier today. He informed them the greatest security threat to the USA was climate change and they would spend the bulk of their careers dealing with refugee situations from various natural disasters that would be occurring at some unspecified point in the future. 
 
Pravda reports Putin was watching on TV and nearly wet himself from laughing so hard.
I, as a Presidential Management Fellow, along with several fed execs had a briefing at Bain by one of their execs in the mid 90s. I wanted to puke after hearing about their parasitic "business model." I tore apart that speaker with some very pointed questions he'll take to his grave. 
Miss Bush yet?
The blood of those honorable Vets are on Obama's Black hands.
your mom did, right after I 3 holed her for 5 bucks.
Bush led the charge...
Really? What makes you not a failure? An internship over 20 years ago?
They should have an Obama / Fifty Cent baseball throwing contest. Closest to home plate over/under 12 ft
Did somebody help you to spell discourse? I don't believe you could do it yourself with your IQ of 35
Mikey has been on the government dole for 38 years.  

I served my country for 20+ years and then established and ran a successful business,  He is simply jealous of that success, being too afraid to try to survive, much less, succeed in the real world.  

I would suggest that he is the one with zero credibility.
Obama Lied, Vets Died.
Elect GOP and get this

Fraud, failure and bankruptcy pay well for CEOs

Commentary: Have you fed your Cash-Eating Organism today?

Richard Fuld had a $66 million payday in 2000 because, well, he was a great chief executive officer, now wasnt he?

Though the Internet bubble popped and the Nasdaq peaked in 2001, he made another $105.2 million. In 2002, he bagged yet another $28.7 million; 2003, $52.9 million; 2004, $41.8 million; 2005, $104.4 million; 2006, $27.3 million; 2007, $40 million.

His tab for eight years of CEO work came to $466.3 million.

You may still remember the name of his company. It was called Lehman Brothers. In 2008, it set a record as historys largest bankruptcy, setting off the nuclear reaction we now call the financial crisis and cementing Americas future as a socialist state for giant banks and corporations. 

Fuld is among the cast of characters enumerated in a retrospective report released by the Institute for Policy Studies: Executive Excess 2013. Bailed Out, Booted, Busted: A 20-Year Review of Americas Top-Paid CEOs. Before 2008, he made the list of Americas top 25 highest-paid executives for eight years in a row. 

To be in the top 25 for eight consecutive years before you crash and burn the economy, its just unbelievable, said Sarah Anderson, one of the reports authors.

Her study analyzed 500 corporate executive positions that have been listed in The Wall Street Journals annual executive pay surveys over the past 20 years.

When she began this research, she expected bailed-out, booted and busted CEOs would make up maybe 15% of the sample. But no, it tallied 38%.

These poorly performing chief executives either wound up getting fired, had to pay massive settlements or fines related to fraud charges, or led firms that crashed or had to be bailed out during the 2008 financial crisis, the report says.

 CEOs whose firms received taxpayer bailouts or ceased to exist held 22% of these 500 slots over the past two decades.

 CEOs who were forced out of their jobs made up 8%. (This is not bad work, if you can get it: The average golden parachute was valued at $48 million.)

 CEOs who led companies paying significant fraud-related fines or settlements comprised another 8% of the sample. (Most of these settlements totaled more than $100 million

Nearly 40% of the top-paid executives were bailed out, booted out or busted.
your troll fu stinks, take your meds and log off.
Obama spies on all Americans, kills our vets, and helps the Radical Jihadists take over the Middle East.

And He throws like a hom.
He knew, He just didn't give a F--K
Tax breaks for the job creators

Wrong
at a gay bath house in Chicago with Rahm
Coming from a lifelong failure, he has more credibility than you.
such bs...all you can come up with...What about McCain's voting record on veterans...how convenient to forget that
ObamaCare is designed with Death Panels.
Coming from a life-long recipient of federal tax dollars. This poster is a retired zero combat decorated mil who was later handed a double dipping DOD desk job from his fellow double dippers in that hyper inbred and mediocrity reeking DOD office. He has ZERO credibility!
26 Republican governors not expanding Medicaid  are the death panels for vets.
>>:>If I were a vet
But your not so move on
Obama COULD have helped these Vets, but He had a golf game that morning.
Define Neocon Socrates!
thanks for staying on topic, I bet you are gay with HIV and the AZT be rotting the brain.
Will the next GOP candidate for POTUS bring his Etch-a-Sketch?

Everything changes. Its like Etch A Sketch. You can shake it up, and we start all over again.

- Nitt Rumnuts
Obama won't let our troops vote, and now He's killing them with His Death Panels.

If I were a vet, I would be furious to know that Obama is killing your brothers in Death Panels.
Yet you have no clue what a neocon actually is!

You are pathetic.
Here, here!
Elect a Black Socialist Liar, this is what you get: Death Panels.
You can't be wrong if care, even if your clueless
You are on the wrong website, and likely the wrong planet.
Word Ian, very trivial.
Romney?  Are you serious?
Sarah Plain
The fact that Obama is Black just makes Him arrogant.  The fact that He's a Progressive makes Him hate the troops.
Like what? You're delusional. The only aspect of life that went to Hell was loss of civility brought on by neocons trying to make every day and situation seem like the end of the world. Of course they were all making a fortune in the stock market while you were falling for it though. They will have taken 8 years of your life by the time you get a clue. 
So, what is your point!  You wanted to learn a trade - it took you 5 years - you then moved into the civilian world and continued your long list of failures (38 years worth.)
We do? Are you a vet? Did Obama give you the research results?
Still no FACTS.... Id JIt
Right!
Yea, "bring 'em on" chickenhawk to the bone Shrub as well as all of the other neocon chickenhawk abysmal failures sure "supported 'da troops," huh....

Mindless lemming R principally motivated BY FEAR!
But most veterans, unlike you, are not huge POS
Black Obama is just too arrogant to admit He was lying and Sarah Palin was right.......again.
There are some Veterans including myself that are highly decorated, but nevertheless, we all served proudly.
Bush put them on death panels. He also created so many they overloaded the system.
Progressives like Obama just love killing off babies and veterans.
Is every Obama hater as incoherent as you are?
We like our healthcare...when and if we can get an appointment.
It helps if you play by the rules and don't get banned.
Looks like Sarah Palin was spot-on about Obama's Death Panels.
 
 Will the arrogant Black Obama ever admit He was wrong about ANYTHING?
The US Code was changed and Mikey hates that his OPINION is being ignored by everyone who has the authority to change it.  So he rants here - but is banned/blocked on most sites so only has CNN as a playground.
That's 2,920,00 per annum (do the math).
Once again, stupid.
Another fool off his meds.
Stop blaming Obama. It's not like he is in charge of anything.
Because every aspect of life was better?
Most veterans, including me, are not combat decorated. 
Not that I was a huge Bush fan, but given what we have now...HELL YEA!!!
Awe Mikey, you really are throwing in the towel now! Don't give up! You didn't give up
When you hit 200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900,1000 rejections until you found someone who would hire you! Don't give up now! 
For the WIN!
you have 18,000 cnn comments lol
Even a bad elected President is still hands down better than one that SCO/TUS appoints unconstitutionally.
You KNEW that Bush loved our troops, 
but with the Black Obama you get the sense He would rather they be put on Death Panels.
blame your mom for that
Da speelin waz rite ta ME!!!!! ah dunt kno whacu be tiepen bout....cunt!
Every day in every way.  Bush had more class in his fecal matter than Obama has in his whole body.
Yeah... we miss Bush like a john misses syphilis.
Oh I get it! Those bureaucrats pushing vets away from treatment are respecting them. Sorry, you're right.
That was then. Now they get two. And every figure I cited was and is 100% accurate! 
So many posts, so little thought.
Still waiting for a response, Mikey.
I assume you refer to the administration of Mr Bush.
Why the Hell for?  Bush did what he was told just like every other President (except Lincoln and Kennedy). Wake up. 
Stop whining about Obama. The VA has had problems for decades. Fire Shinseki and prosecute the book cookers.
Even conservatives hate outright bigots and racists.
They prefer subtlety, unlike outright bigots and racists.
Miss Bush yet?
And she is still wrong.  It is the managers greedy for bonuses.
ROTFLMAO, do you know any real vets, cause they suck.
Obama lied, Vets died.
Doctor Dumb is more accurate.
And even more spittle, vomit, and bile from a cowardly old fool. 
Hmm, a Conservative President started two (2) unfunded wars.  The Conservative GOP consistently votes AGAINST anything for the VA, because they can't have additional add-ons they want & that have NOTHING to do with VETS.  They take from the Vets when they can't get what they want.  1000% pure obstructionism.
But he's in the seat now.....
No surprise here that Obama uses Death Panels, Sarah Palin told predicted this long ago.
Selfish American Progressive women kill 8000 babies every day.
 
Why would Progressives care about a few old Vietnam Vets?
Hilarious!  What a fvcking mor0n.
Actually true.. Are you a mole for the FBI trying to win my confidence?
Be careful how you word it, because your rights are being taken away by this site. They took away my last 2 posts.
Not true in any way.
The death panel thing is going overboard.   The waiting list is all about who has pull.
His yells for the NSA was a new low! And hilarious!
Conservatives cut their funding every chance they get. Once they have fought their war they don't care.
I'm a clean and liberal Christian.
And I care.
You're just a nasty and mean spirited bigot.
Conservatives put murderous criminals to death, and Progressives protect them.

Progressives kill our honored troops, and Conservatives defend them. 
 
 Progressives are sick.
Partisan hack.  You're all useless.
This started well before Obama was in office.
Conservatives put murderous criminals to death, and Progressive protect them. 
 
Progressives kill our honored troops, and Conservatives defend them.
Exactly what have I lied about, Mikey?
Only in the GOP & FAUX's bilnd-eyes...
Progressives like the vet-killing part, but the Bad Press makes them nervous.
And evidently you would follow Sarah Palin.
Or mail that promised letter.....
He is not killing vets the selfish managers are.
Progressives eagerly follow their God Obama to hell.
That would be the stench from you in the presence of actual FACTS.
Obama will do NOTHING to hold His people responsible.
 
Obama will be killing Vets until He is replaced.
Yeah...my best friend is a vet with some health issues. Just getting any kind of regular treatment is very difficult at the VA...although he tells me it varies from hospital to hospital. He switched to a farther facility and the care is better but still not as frequent as he needs.
And payments are LEGAL & AUTHORIZED only when housing is not available.
I'm progressive and blame Obama.  It's on his watch.
But death panels?  Stupid.
Mikey, are you drunk enough to start screaming for the NSA to save you from our mean posts?
Where is msnbc, holder the poser or Americas favorite senior lesbian blowhole, penosi? If shinski is this incompetent and won't step down, maybe his past credentials should be questioned.
Yea
And you hold more ignorance and bigotry than substance.  I feel bad for you.
Obama is truly their God.
The truth from you and your shipyard buddies, Mikey.  You really should not post so much information that you do not want shared with the public.
She's a fount of wisdom.
No he does what he does best, just looks the other way
It's not by design, because Obama doesn't have a clue what's going on.....
Selfish managers who wanted bonuses.
Progressives are evil.  Their goal everyday is to try to convince us wrong is right.
You're quoting Palin again...
When I arrived in Misawa in 1975 i was assigned to a tiny 8x10 room with another person.  They were a slob and I had no intention of living in that situation.   Since "quarters" were "avaialble", I did not apply for nor draw a housing allowance.  I simply purchased a two bedroom house in town for the time I was there (loved it and stayed for 2 1/2 years) and sold it when I departed.  I was the only round-eye in a several block radius and enjoyed the atmosphere and neighbors.
vets? doubtful. current active duty- sure why not, they only pay $50 a month for it
filthy Liberals.

including you?
LOL.
then i will gladly enjoy Bush's execution as a result of the 911 attacks
Progressives would NEVER blame their God Obama.
 
 But it is Obama's fault - His Death Panels are killing vets.
Pour spelling, worse logic, and devoid of facts.
I think it's because he's stupid
Firing people won't fix it.  FIXING it will fix it.  It's going to cost trillions and several acts of Congress.  The problem is that Congress and the American people just don't care because it doesn't affect them.  I've used VA before, in general, you'd be better off stepping in front of a truck...and NOT because the staff are bad.  Most aren't.  Their hands are tied by all the red tape.
You are a bald faced cowardly LIAR!
Sarah Palin has been right about 89% of the time. 
 
Obama...not so much.
Ah, your old fallback when you are at a loss!

Define neocon you loser!
Black Obama doesn't really care about these vets, He only cares about the Bad Press.
Just like all the rest of you filthy Liberals.
That's not what makes him lie . He lies because he is to stupid to find the truth
Liberal part is true 100%
I really don't like to insult, but that was a stupid post.
Nope...and that's why heads should roll in this case. Vets were deliberately denied care and it was covered up by false records. I'm not a vet myself but as the son of a WW2 combat vet and godfather of a current vet who has served in Iraq and Afghanistan, it sickens me.
Obama is a liar because He's Black and a Liberal.
The left would rather appease Europe than have a successful country.
Your fear is palpable!
Obama is killing these vets as payback for the sequester.
Try an stay on topic...I know it hard for liberals.
Just keep talking simpleton
Coming from the Queen of the Stupid, he should consider it a compliment.
Not true and shown to be NOT TRUE over and over.  Deal with it, Mikey, they aren't going away.
You should read Federal labor law...you might learn something.  This isn't the private sector.  You can't fire people because you may be having a bad day.  Outside the private sector, workers have rights.  You can get fired from a federal job (pretty easily, actually) provided you have a management team that properly documents poor performance.  Without documentation, you can't fire people.
It got out of hand because Black Obama is president.
I like your kind
Anyone want to know what McCain has done to improve the VA Hospital situation in 30 plus years in the Senate===>Absolutely Nothing
The only liars are you prior and current entitlement moribund recipients of these absurd tax free handouts!  Every word I've said and every figure I cited is 100% true and accurate and verifiable simply by googling and then perusing these handout tables. Now cry all you want!
This doesn't surprise me at all. Progressives like Obama hate vets to begin with.
Or you can continue to post your moronic drivel to let everyone know what end of the intellectual spectrum you are from.!!!!!!!
The most corrupt administration we have ever had - top to bottom - and it starts at the top.
Well, in my VA experience,  these calls are handled by the VA facility by Americans. The VA gives good care,  this is a management anomaly of serious proportion... and should be dealt with harshly.
Nobody needs to defend it to you because you are a nobody!

And the 2-3 year moves are quite recent.
Most posts from a silly little failure who refuses to accept that he is the source of his failures, now and in the past.  Now that is FEARFUL.
lol so gay
Obama kills Veterans, Clinton Rapes women, Algore profits from terror-sponsoring Oil nations.
 
There is no line Progressives won't cross for their egos.
If you get a terminal disease, you are better off committing a crime and going to prison to get top level health care for free.
Or you can continue to post your moronic drivel to let everyone know what end of the intellectual spectrum you are from
Nope, just someone who appreciates the truth.  

A "coward" claims he attended "law school" when he attended a single semester.  That coward has to try to appear to be more important than he could every hope to be.
Doesn't explain why the U.S. government is killing vets.
Utter rubbish spewed from a coward afraid of these facts about these $21 billion per year tax free handouts getting known by the general public.
No, you need proof housing goes unused.

But proof has never stopped you rants before. But you are used to failure!
Obama kills American Veterans. 
Chris Christie just closed a bridge.
Lord Obama says Shinseki didn't do anything wrong.  If you say Shinseki should be fired you are a racist.
I'm sure vets have to call in to make a Dr.'s appointment....... The call goes to India !
Wake up America. My wife work for Northrup Gruman on highly , highly classified $#!T.  You have to be 100% American, born here, parents lived here, no foreign relations whatsoever. Check , check check.
Go try morron. Go back to your trailer and lock the door.
That is your defense of tax free handouts of upwards of $3,000 a month for singles and $9,000 a month for dual marrieds be they heterosexual or homosexual? 

And these moves every 2 to 3 years that cost the US taxpayers BILLIONS each year are a defacto musical chair drill with roots in the LAST CENTURY! 

Your arguments are beyond pathetic to support these absurd tax free handouts of $21,000,000,000 per year off the backs of the US taxpayers! 
might as well be, neither work.
I haven't drawn a housing allowance in over 35 years.  When I did, it covered 1/3 of the rental on my efficiency apartment.  Terrible handout it most certainly was NOT.

They aren't going away, Mikey, no matter how much you lie.
The tone of the organization is set at the top.  Ultimately, Obama is responsible.
Progressives don't care that Veterans died, that makes them happy.
Please if your former military you know blame always rest on the shoulders of command....
liberals live to fail
It's amazing that people like you probably talk to government employees like that AND expect them to treat you with the utmost respect.  Isn't that right?
+100
I don't think so.
Obama owes Sarah Palin an APOLOGY.
obama doesn't care.  all VA patients are republicans anyhow...
Obama lied, Veterans died.
What a SAD Country we have become.  Illegal Immigrants get better health care than pour Veterans.  Nice Job Barrack Obama.
Point.
I believe we can find a balance between cost and care....right now we have extremely high costs and a fairly unhealthy population compared to other Western and industrialized nations with universal healthcare.
Sarah Palin was right, but the Black Obama is just too arrogant to admit He was wrong.
She DID quote Palin! ;)
Privatize it and print money.....
The Left gave us The Emperor Rufus, and now wants to replace him with Mrs Magoo -- this collective band of Leftist perverts, socialists, and degenerates have ruined our once great American culture and place of honor in the world. Remember In November!!!
Not yet....
Death Panels.
The VA isn't Obamacare, troll.
Look into a mirror then. You made the stupid comment for me to look up something on the internet that does not prove anything.
Or you can  post your moronic drivel to let everyone know what end of the intellectual spectrum you are from
Sarah Palin was RIGHT!! 
ObamaCare kills people.
Lying by omission is still lying, Mikey.  They are legal and authorized and are not going away just because you don't like them.
Obama Lied. Vet Died.
Rubbish and spittle from a coward.
Not much you can do about 2008 and 2012 either.  So shut up about it.  The problem is the voters, not the people that get elected.
More vomit from another fearful current recipient of these absurd tax free handouts. 
...now I can't even understand his babble. Your meds are wearing off.
Or better yet post his own post that claimed he had failed 1,000 consecutive times to get hired in a 3 year period.  Priceless.
I know it does...which is why it's even more infuriating.  The taxpayers of this country have had damn near 100 years to demand change, but always back off when they see the price tag.  We (vets) are screwed.  The private system is run like a business, so it's priced out of range for most people, and the VA kills you.  That's the definition of futility.
Liberals get over yourselves and your "ideas" that never work.
Google the tables ourselves and you will see that every word I said and every figure I cited is true and accurate. 
LEGAL & AUTHORIZED payments which are made ONLY when GOVERNMENT QUARTERS ARE NOT AVAILABLE.

Deal with it, Mikey!   They aren't going away simply because you do not approve of them.
Not taking any time to look at anything current.  When I was AD, married military couples (both military) received about 1.5 the single BAH rate.
Would you care to elaborate on how many more vets and non-vets are being treated between those years?
Everything is fine, just check the polls.  Vets love the VA.
More vomit spewed from a fearful recipient of these handouts, 
not much we can do about that now is there? btw, I tend to agree, Bush was a massive spender and greatly increased the size of government...  then we got stuck with someone magnitudes worse.
Miley, post the link to the article about you so we can all have a good laugh!
So Obama himself falsified those records himself>  Huh Dummy
In order to get bonuses!!! 
The problems at the VA go back decades...but this scandal is particularly disturbing.
Mikey's "career"(if you could call it that) was spent on a ship in Sd harbour learning a trade, aparently poorly as he job hopped through 3 related jobs in the next 12 years.
If Obama for once actually acted like a president and started rolling heads sure. But what do we get? "Needs more time to asses the situation".... Mr. Jello Spine.
Obama doesn't have anything to do with it.
Shouldn't have done that in 2000 and 2004.
Rubbish!  Google "2014 basic allowance for housing tables" for yourselves. And you will see that every word and every figure I cited is true and accurate. And the figures for other cites is just as absurd as the four I cited. See the facts for yourselves about this $21 billion per year gravy train off your backs. 
In 2008 we probably should have elected something other than an inept clown who is totally incapable of fixing any of the problems.
Obama signed it into law... what reality are you living in?
Look guys, this is not an accident or an oversight. It's a deliberate falsification of veterans' hospital records. Can you pull yourselves out of Obama's bum long enough to recognize that?
When you have a spineless president of course nothing will change.
I deal in the truth, Binky Boy.  That is why you hate to have the truth pointed out about you and your "career."  I will admit it is not a very pretty sight but you do OWN it.
Awe, someone realizes they have to proof!
Feel free to take advantage of this offer, move your family every few years and risk having your limbs blown off. Then suddenly it seems a small price to pay. 
Cherry picked numbers to support his OPINION and nothing more.  Lying by omission is still lying, Mikey.
EVERYTHING!
You are a fearful liar!
This is the most disgraceful government ever.  Pump us full of drugs instead of helping us deal with the horrible stuff we've had to do for the people of this country and then sweep us under the rug...until we start mowing down women and children because we just can't cope anymore, then we're the bad guys.  Nice country.  I wonder if Russia treats it's vets this good?
Difficult to forget George when his legacy of failure is all around us.
Nope, if you have any actual evidence that quarters are available and not used, pull them out Binky Boy and show the world.  You have not had any for the last 8 years and have none now.
Obama firing a union worker?  He'll allow the Keystone pipeline before that.
Every word is true. Every figure is fully accurate and 100% verifiable!
Sorry, not in todays world.
Because I'm talking about 5 years.....not 10.
Legal: yes 

But PLENTY of quarters go unused or underused in favor of these $21,000,000,000 per year tax free handouts and gravy train!
I'm pretty sure if any POTUS wanted to fire somebody, he'd fire them. Effectively.
OPINION only.
His therapist gave up trying.
Obama doesn't have a handle on anything, except maybe his gulf club.....
You neglect to note the immense increase in services provided over the last decade.
LEGAL & AUTHORIZED and paid ONLY WHEN there are NO GOVERNMENT QUARTERS AVAILABLE.

Deal with it, Mikey!
I am in full agreement with every human on earth: you are a failure.

You don't even know what a neocon is, yet you use the word because you heard it as a catch phrase!
Break up all public workers union. It is a perverted system
Give Obama/Shinseki firing rights and they will do the job. Until then the civil servants will continue there raping of America's treasury.
Apparently no one told Ian Zinger that George Bush is no longer President.
He simply blames the military for his 38 years as a failure.  He had no interest in the truth which has been provided time and again to him.
To the reasoned and intelligent readers. Every word and every figure I've stated about the tax free so-called "housing" handouts is true and accurate. 

But this site attracts posters who are or were direct beneficiaries of these objectively absurd tax free handouts, They are fearful and resentful of my efforts to inform the public about them. Ignore these very small minded voices of fear, bitterness, and selfishness. They are unworthy of a single moment of your attention. 
Unionized government workers. What could go wrong?
Local building officials will get you to fill out tons of paper work when they know, they will never approve your job.
I am in full agreement with both the prior and current SECDEF's public statements declaring that the all volunteer military has vastly bloated personnel costs that are "unsustainable." And here's one facet of those vastly bloated costs that everyone can relate to.

I just checked the DOD travel site to see the new "BAH" (or basic allowance for housing) tables for 2014. They were just increased ON AVERAGE by an incredible 5%. Some locations, including no less that tropical vacation destination for many- HawaiiI, were increased by a whopping 15% AND MORE! And in 2013 they were ALSO INCREASED by 3.8% on average as well!

For those of you who do not know, these monthly allowances (that in actuality are tax free handouts) for optional off-ship or off-base 'housing' needs for military volunteers are (a) tax free; (b) above and beyond base pays, other pays, and other tax free allowances; and (c) require no proof whatsoever that they are even being used for optional off-ship or off-base 'housing.'

Here's a small sample of these staggering figures by 4 cites and 3 ranks for "dual married' military couples (when two members marry each other, including homosexual couples) with 1 dependent:

Washington, DC:
Two married E-3s*: $3,612
Two married E-7s**: $4,608
Two married O-6s***: $5,919

San Diego:
Two married E-3s: $3,552
Two married E-7s: $4,608
Two married O-6s: $5,553

Honolulu, HI
Two married E-3s: $4,563
Two married E-7s: $6,060
Two married O-6s: $7,778

San Francisco, CA
Two married E-3s: $5,709
Two married E-7s: $7,116
Two married O-6s: $8,949

* E-3s are typically 18/19 years old, GED or HS educated, wiith 1 year in the military since moving out of their parent's homes.

** E-7s are the same as above but add 10-12 years

*** Essentially all 'dual married' O-6 couples are already being paid cumulatively from $220,000-$280,000 per year in combined base pays, other pays, and other tax free allowances. And all other lower ranked dual married officer couples are being paid from $125,000-$250,000 per year!

Every word cited above is true. And every eye-popping and absurd figure is fully accurate that was taken right from the "2014 BAH Tables."

The culture of entitlement is alive and well in our nation's all volunteer military. DOD ought to be ashamed of itself for this $21 BILLION per year tax free monthly GRAVY TRAIN that 99% of the general US population knows anything about (until now)! 

Contact your members of Congress today to get this preposterous $21 billion per year and growing waste stopped.
LEGAL & AUTHORIZED, deal with it!
looks like your bosses at Media Matters gave you a lot to cut and paste in tonight
Mikey is relieving stress because the nurses took his walker away!
Watch for Elizabeth Warren.
VA budget in 2009 was $88 Billion  now its $153 Billion -- about double in 5 years.

Plenty of money to give corrupt government workers bonuses.
You're a broken record .
No need to defend LEGAL & AUTHORIZED housing payments, toilet paper boy.

And you have provided no evidence, yet again, to support your OPINION that there is adequate housing that is not being used.  


Deal with it, Mikey.
Dual married volunteer couples, the vast majority of who sit behind desks and are NOT combat decorated, get handed TWO, repeat TWO, repeat TWO of these tax free handouts.

If they have a kid one gets the higher "with dependents" rate and the other gets the slightly lower "without dependents" rate. If no kid, then they BOTH get the "without" rate. Anyone asserting otherwise is either IGNORANT OR A LIAR!

And yes, there are tens of thousands of these couples getting handed from $4,000-$6,000-$9,000, yes $9,000 a month TAX FREE in addition to their combined base pays, other pays, and other tax free monthly handouts in the $100,000-$280,000 a year range depending on their ranks and years as a military volunteer.

Absurd
Ludicrous
Preposterous 
But 100% true and accurate and fully verifiable
Google "2014 basic allowance for housing tables" and see the facts and ridiculous figures about these $21,000,000,000 per year tax free handouts for yourselves
Dear Abby.


I am in a bad way. A hotwife, and I mean hot, has moved in across the street with her husband. I can't stop looking at her. Too fine!!! She comes out in the yard everyday just to tease me. I know she does it on purpose and I am tired of spanking my meat raw. I'm not sure how to deal with this. Should I:
.
.
1. Buy her a pretty blue dress and spew on it like bill clinton did?
2. Get her drunk and drown her in a ditch like teddy kennedy did?
3. Hope my wife gets cancer so I can be a baby daddy like john edwards did?
4. Send picks of my weiner across the country like anthony weiner did?
5. Say she won't have me and shoot up the town like the llibtarrd in california did?
.
Confused llibtarrd from Houston
$15 is CHEAP! 
Focus your attention to lower-level personnel, not just Colonels & above...
Over the Bush/Obama years, VA spending has tripled and the number of patients declined by more than 4 million. While campaigning Obama claimed the VA was a priority. Of course in retrospect that was just another of the endless Obama lies.
Now where is your long awaited defense of the TWO handouts for the dual married volunteers? You know, these couples who are getting handed tax free monthly windfalls of $4,000-$6,000-$9,000, YES $9,000 IN ADDITION to their combined base pays, other pays, and other tax free monthly handouts of $100,000-$280,000!

Don't continue to be afraid! Step up. Let's hear your ENTITLEMENT LADEN argument why these highly paid couples should NOT be expected to fund their own housing needs from their salaries JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE!

The floor is ALL YOURS! Good luck! You'll SURELY need it!

Well Mikey, specifically what is to blame for your 38 years of medocrity and failure?
A Center for American Progress analysis says, "President Bush's 2005 budget would increase prescription drug co-pays from $7 to $15 for many veterans. In 2002, the co-pay went from $2 to $7." This co-pay increase would have the biggest impact on "near-poor" veterans whose incomes are just high enough to require that they pay the new premium.
Just flag this dullard...they will start deleting his babble.
NONE would be my guess.....
...Oct 2003==>Bush Administration opposed plan to give National Guard and Reserve Members access to health insurance. Despite the war efforts of America's National Guard and Reserve Members, the Bush Administration announced in October 2003 its formal opposition to give the 1.2 million Guard and Reserve members the right to buy health care coverage through the Pentagon's health plan. One out of every five Guard members lacks health insurance.
Well, we wouldn't want that nonexistent smoking gun to be a nonexistent mushroom cloud, now would we?
Unless you post any sources this is all just BS... you're one of the dumbest people on here.

He sure did.


We'll be paying for that Iraq fiasco for decades.
GW and the GOP were real busy in 2003===> Bush Administration cuts $172 million allotted for educating the children of military personnel. The Bush Administration's 2004 budget cut $172 million of impact aid funding. Impact aid funding assists school districts by making up for lost local tax revenue from tax-exempt property, such as military bases. These education cuts will especially affect school-age children of troops serving in Iraq who reside on military bases.
Source?..lol
I too am happy my TriCare program...
Fake scandals are still FAKE no matter how many times your Tee Vee spews them at you.
And more rubbish from a fearful recipient of these tax free pseudo welfare handouts!
2003==>Bush Administration proposal would end health care benefits for 173,000 veterans. More than 173,000 veterans across the country would be cut off from health care because of Bush Administration proposed budget cuts and its plan requiring enrollment fees and higher out-of-pocket costs
Rubbish!
Utter rubbish! It's only been in recent years that these entitlement festering a  free handouts have even been permitted on ships! 

Red States receive $1.24 for every $1 they send the Federal Gubmint.

Blue Staes receive $0.89 for every $1 we send.


Thank Democrats for the free ride.
Tertiary syphilis - it does terrible things to the brain.  Mikey spent way too much time in those open Navy showers onboard his ship for 5 years.
Those debts you can kiss the conservatives for.
WRONG yet again, Mikey.  You are welcome to your OPINION but you have no facts to back up that loud mouth of yours and never have.  Deal wtih it, Mikey!
No, plenty of housing is not available. Are you senile? This is a serious question!
Get to a real hospital.
Bush lied.......
Bush....
But Bush........
The past is the past.
That's because the GOP is responsible for it...
But Bush.....
He isn't interested in the truth.  He blames the military for 38 years of failures and has posted this rant for almost 8 years, updating it with newer numbers every year.
The progressives are just waiting for today's dinosaurs to become extinct.
Times change.
Just look at the time, 6 years have passed.
Obama '06 on raising the debt ceiling. (Just one of many lies)

"The fact that we are here today to debate raising Americas debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. Government cant pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Governments reckless fiscal policies.  Increasing Americas debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that the buck stops here. Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better."
What a pile of utter nonsense! Plenty of singles living quarters exist on the bases and ships these volunteers are assigned!  But most go unused or underused in favor of these ABSURD tax free monthly handouts! 

And every figure I cited is 100% accurate and verifiable.  YOU are either ignorant or attempting to deceive!  Which is it you zero combat decorated PUNK!

And most of these dual marrieds ARE ALREADY being paid from $100,000-$280,000 ( depending on their ranks and years in) in combined base and other pays and a plethora of other monthly tax free handouts! 

You entitlement moribund lifers are sickening in your depths of entitlement thinking!  Get off the binky and try to earn a living in the REAL WORLD away from the financial security blankee that IS the mil for most of you zero combat decorated desk jockeys!
Obama '07 Promise (Just one of many lies)

"I will provide our intelligence and law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to track and take out the terrorists without undermining our Constitution and our freedom.

That means no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens. No more national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime. No more tracking citizens who do nothing more than protest a misguided war. No more ignoring the law when it is inconvenient. That is not who we are."
It's 2014.
Obama '08 on Bypassing Congress. (Just one of many lies)

I taught constitutional law for ten years. I take the Constitution very seriously. 
The biggest problems that were facing right now have to do with George Bush trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch and not go through Congress at all, and thats what I intend to reverse when Im President of the United States of America.
OPINION - still without a shred of evidence to the contrary.  Deal with it, Mikey!
Obama '06 on raising the debt ceiling. (Just one of many lies)

This only talks about the Navy.  BUT, a single sailor can't be expected to live aboard ship the entire time they're active-duty.  They wouldn't be able to recruit more sailors!
Fox News is for low grade morons.
Because Republics nearly destroyed the World Economy with their Great Recession 2007-2009.

Job LOSSES 2008-2009 = (-7,200,000)

Job GAINS 2010-2014 = +8,700,000


No Mikey, you remain clueless and refuse to listen to anyone.  Which is why you were rejected in over 1000 applications!
We got to the bottom of it.  It's Bush's fault.  :)
Had Obama just watched Fox News he would have known about this and the other scandals early on, instead he tuned in to CNN and learned about a missing plane.
Maybe the vets that have no real issues, as I know for me been 6 years trying to get treatment. Been waiting for something done about the Thyroid cancer they told me I have now for over 9 moths...
Currently legal? Yes

But there is PLENY of unused and underused singles quarters on their ships and bases in favor of the tax free handouts! 

You are either ignorant or a liar!  You pick!
Are you a vet?  Apparently NOT.  You have NO IDEA what you're talking about.  BAH is ONLY GRANTED WHEN NO OTHER HOUSING EXISTS.  The military members don't chose where they're stationed.  The military ORDERED them to these locations.  Active-Duty Military would be HOMELESS in high cost of living areas if it wasn't for BAH.
Mikey, what is a neocon you failure?!
And that's a bad thing WHY?
Wait a minute, Hillary isn't a man?
No, it's not.
Gee? Really????
LEGAL & AUTHORIZED housing payments which are ONLY PAID when GOVERNMENT HOUSING IS NOT AVAILABLE.  

Deal with it, Mikey!
If Hillary was a man, Obama would have been President.
Woo hoo!  Cannot wait until November!
Only not really.
If Obama was white, Hillary would have been President
Obama can't get re-elected, he's not eligible.
No.
Mission accomplished and he didn't even need a cod piece.
Is the Progressive movement dying?

Majority of Governors are Republican.
Majority of State Legislatures are Republican.
Majority of the House of Representatives is Republican.
Soon, the Majority of the Senate will be Republican.

Some locations, including no less that tropical vacation destination for many- HawaiiI, were increased by a whopping 15% AND MORE! And in 2013 they were ALSO INCREASED by 3.8% on average as well!

For those of you who do not know, these monthly allowances (that in actuality are tax free handouts) for optional off-ship or off-base 'housing' needs for military volunteers are (a) tax free; (b) above and beyond base pays, other pays, and other tax free allowances; and (c) require no proof whatsoever that they are even being used for optional off-ship or off-base 'housing.'

Here's a small sample of these staggering figures by 4 cites and 3 ranks for "dual married' military couples (when two members marry each other, including homosexual couples) with 1 dependent:

Washington, DC:
Two married E-3s*: $3,612
Two married E-7s**: $4,608
Two married O-6s***: $5,919

San Diego:
Two married E-3s: $3,552
Two married E-7s: $4,608
Two married O-6s: $5,553

Honolulu, HI
Two married E-3s: $4,563
Two married E-7s: $6,060
Two married O-6s: $7,778

San Francisco, CA
Two married E-3s: $5,709
Two married E-7s: $7,116
Two married O-6s: $8,949

* E-3s are typically 18/19 years old, GED or HS educated, wiith 1 year in the military since moving out of their parent's homes.

** E-7s are the same as above but add 10-12 years

*** Essentially all 'dual married' O-6 couples are already being paid cumulatively from $220,000-$280,000 per year in combined base pays, other pays, and other tax free allowances. And all other lower ranked dual married officer couples are being paid from $125,000-$250,000 per year!

Every word cited above is true. And every eye-popping and absurd figure is fully accurate that was taken right from the "2014 BAH Tables."

The culture of entitlement is alive and well in our nation's all volunteer military. DOD ought to be ashamed of itself for this $21 BILLION per year tax free monthly GRAVY TRAIN that 99% of the general US population knows anything about (until now)! 

Contact your members of Congress today to get this preposterous $21 billion per year and growing waste stopped.
Obama could hold a press conference on the White House Lawn, urinate on the American Flag, light it on fire, and he'd still get re-elected, if eligible. After him will come Hillary for 8 years. Due to mass immigration, there will never be another Republican President so long as America exists. These scandals will not have any bearing on the upcoming Presidential election. Midterms, maybe, but not 2016.
13 Benghazis occurred on Bush's watch without a peep from you.
There's been that talk about third term.
And we did.


They were all fake.
"I will get to the bottom of this and punish those responsible." - Obama on Benghazi
"I will get to the bottom of this and punish those responsible." - Obama on IRS
"I will get to the bottom of this and punish those responsible." - Obama on AP
"I will get to the bottom of this and punish those responsible." - Obama on F&F
"I will get to the bottom of this and punish those responsible." - Obama on NSA
"I will get to the bottom of this and punish those responsible." - Obama on VA
Got to blame Bush for that too
Go TriCare.  I've been retired 13 years & happy with my medical care.
That's what I get for trying to converse with a tbagger.
How about you putting on a uniform, then when your time is up, you go to the VA and do YOUR reserarch?
Benghazi never was.
"Dude, this Benghazi and IRS thing was sooo 2 years ago.......but Bush......."
I hope he doesn't run again.
Blow me
Only nasties toss their cover like a rag.  The Marine Corps has a little more respect for its uniform, and would only stand when ordered.
If you hate government so much, there are places without it, please feel free to move there.
Feudalism does not lead to prosperity or freedom, contrary to what you hear at TP rallies.
Obama is soooo finished. Even the Democrats are calling for Shinsekie to resign
Better not vote GOP.
Don't question the POTUS.  If you do you are a racist.
Its clear to me folks that big government is a big failure.
There's a select few people with less credibility than President Barack Obama.

1. CNN, the missing plane network.
2. Bill Clinton
3. Hillary Clinton
4. Nancy Pelosi
5. Harry Reid
6. OJ Simpson

Federal funds earmarked to offset Affordable Care Act insurer losses

The Obama administration has quietly adjusted key provisions of its signature healthcare law to potentially make billions of additional taxpayer dollars available to the insurance industry if companies providing coverage through the Affordable Care Act lose money. - LA Times
They'll be on KP for being racists.
I like the fact that only 25% of the Westpoint finest applauded for Obama.....must have been embarrasing
"MGKnJAK -->mac4242
6 hours ago
No we don't.  We just deal with it as best as possible."


I agree MGK.  I have an interesting observation on this.  My small consulting biz didn't do too well, and I found myself living in a neighborhood in Phoenix that was very low income for a while (around 59th & Northern if anyone knows the area...technically Glendale).


A lot of vets lived nearby, due to the low rent and a Veterans center building nearby.  These poor, poor guys ...in wheel chairs, some without limbs, some who couldn't speak.  It was outrageous to me.  This is how so many of them end up, barely living hand-to-mouth, crossing a 6 lane street in their wheel chairs, and as I now know, bereft of medical attention, something I wondered at the time but had no reason to know for sure.


Regardless of what any of the talking heads are saying, we collectively don't do too well taking care of our vets, and in a country that is supposedly wealthy, it is disgraceful.  But then, we still have firefighters from 9/11 with health problems who are turned down for assistance because it might cost too much.



To the veterans, and any of you who've helped others and now suffer, you will ALWAYS be appreciated by me and many others.  I wish I could tell every one of your personally.
They are?
whahahahaha get a Burka and move to Pakistan
All
Bye, bye Shitsekie...go and join Sybillius ha ha
If the economy is so great, why is there always a need to extend unemployment benefits and expand the amount of food stamps every year?
How many of the food stamps recipients in the Red states are Democrat voters?
One scandal after another......
GM is dead and Al Qaeda is alive.
especially the dead ones
but in order to keep your dem card you are specifically to blame Bush
Rightie said, "BUSH WHO???? BUSH NEVER EXISTED!!!! NEVER HEARD OF HIM!!!"
That's redundant.
and Bush, don't forget Bush.......
Without government, business will screw everybody to make profits.
There is plenty of evidence to support that.
46 facilities in all states are being investigated. Dont politicize death you liberal
Class game of the GOP.  Drain all the money out of program and then say "OMG!  Gov't can't do anything!!  We must be more fascist and privatize!!!""
The government is fine.  It's republicans that are the problem.
Unfortunately for many on here, they don't get it .  They are going to be the same people complaining about long lines when we get pushed into a single payer system.  It is going to happen.  We are all going to have to wait 6 months for an Xray, one year for knee replacement surgery.
Compared to your age yes
They are these days!
Unless you consider 21 a kid.
Why do people want the Government running anything. Isn't the Post Office, VA, or IRS proof enough for you ldiots?
But gays can marry and kids can smoke weed.
Now thats progressive folks......
Wow, that is beyond dumb.
Prove that!
6+ years is over night? 
VA is what is a single payer healthcare system looks like.  We should all get used to long lines.
Sibillus and now Shinsekie...wow that Obama cabinet is a real winner folks....
Yeap. I got 20 bucks on that
This needs to be investigated by the DOJ and put on CSPAN for everyone to view. All the way to November
Hey, who invited the guy who refuses to blame Bush??
That is your opinion.


It is wrong.
It's not gonna happen overnight, CONservatives damaged it over the course of years and years. It's not easy getting it done when the right-wing is always sabotaging everything.
What is clear to everyone now is that this administration is incapable to manage their way out of a brown paper bag.
BUSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well he did a wonderful job, did he not??? Bawahahahaha
B S!  you deal with the insanity if there is no other choice.
You could just repeat #2 all four times and saved some key strokes.
Why would I google or gogle something based on people's opinion and not facts?
You're full of spit. Please tell me which war you fought in...and also if you saw actual BATTLE or if you're just milking the system for all it's worth like everyone does now. My niece's husband was in Afghanistan for 6 months and he cries PTSD...never saw real battle. His wife now struggles to make ends meet w/THEIR 2 SONS while he drinks himself to death on taxpayer dime. ENOUGH ALREADY!!!!
What a stupid comment.
What strikes me as odd that liberals are defending this atrocity by:


1. Bush did it
2. Bush was worse
3. We need to spend more money
4. Billary 2016 


You people are so..dumb
Told ya, liar.
All the drugs will do that
Oh right, because EVERYTHING on the internet is true.
Now it's so, first it was no.


What a liar.
But the number of wounded vets has increased 150%.  Tell Congress to get off their fat @$$$$es and INCREASE the VA budget proportionally to the need.
The VA had a 500 Million dollar surplus at the end of 2013, how do explain that?
Are you a vet?
Google it and see.
So, These people waited for half a year. Your numbers dont add up.
I have no idea. Maybe because he does not want to?
They voted down a $21 billion funding bill in February.
You lie, VA funding has increased 78% since 2009.
Why do you think he never leaves the country?
When was he charged with that?
War criminal
But, but but BUSH!!!!!!!!
is a criminal.
BUSH????????????????????/
Actually no, GOP House passed and Dem Senate led by dirty harry reneged
Do better
And what do you think you're gonna do?


Shine my shoes is what you're gonna do.
I punched a liberal yesterday, does that count?
I know you think your posts are cute, but the reality is that the GOP blocked several of the things you mentioned. Do you point fingers at them as well. Heck no. You are far too busy being a troll.
And I am giving myself an upvote. So proud....
In my area there is one VA location where lots of vets personally known to me who are really NOT happy.  I've switched to private (and more expensive) physicians and prescription services with great results.  Show us YOUR research.
Ill have no lobbyists in my administration."

"I'll close Guantanamo."



Really, he said that...lies?
If Obama would have not pandered to gays for 5 years, this would have not happened.
BS, I am a vet and I am scared to death of the VA health care and only use it when absolutely necessary. Did the research identify the 1700 vets waiting for care in Phoenix. Most vets are glad they have any healthcare and appreciate that they get healthcare from the VA, but everyone knows its substandard care. This is one case where the Obama Apologist are not going to get away with this. Shenseki must go!
You talk like a hater of military service?


Tough guy eh?
Where did you serve? On the corner of 8th and Main? Wahahahaha
You picture in facebook
Infantry is where they send everyone too dumb to be useful in combat,
What was the first thing you noticed about me again?
Or you get a cap into your rear scum sucking low life liberal

Ye about liars like you
You are obsessed! Lol
Obama needs to go with Shitsekie.....
Faggie
It's Shinseki's?
The data speaks otherwise liberal!
Its NOT their job to schedule patients, is it?
So what? That doesn't give him any authority over anything. 
Wrong on both counts, but don't let that stop you from departing reality.
Really? He is war hero. Something you only dream about. Low life scum
I will end two wars

I will kill Osama Bin Laden

I will save the Auto Industry

I will turn around the world wide recession and get back all jobs lost under Bush

Everyone will have acess to healthcare

I will lowet unemployment rate

I will do all of this with only one budget, never one vote of support, 337 repeal attempts while nothing else got done or passed by Congress and even through a government shutdown that cost the US economy 32 billion dollars

Id say he did more than any other president has or had to, he has also proved that McCain, Boehner and all those other bias bigots no nothing and couldnt find their way out of a wet paper bag...
SCOTUS helped the first time, Democrats had a weak candidate the second time. Neither time was "Buwahaha" worthy.
Cruz was right on Obamacare
Palin was right on Death Panels...
Good question!  That said, having worked in extremely large corporations, unpleasant information frequently doesn't trickle up to the top - by design.  Those below the top play CYA quite well.
Bush got elected twice. Buwahahahaha
Obama, while not perfect, was the better choice of the two on offer.
Twice.
"You can keep your doctor"

 

"You can keep your plan"

yeap he said that

Good for him. Obama was mistake

Ill put the Health Care negotiations on CSPAN so everyone
can see who is at the table!.

 

Ill have no lobbyists in my administration."

 

"I'll close Guantanamo."



He said that....
Keep trying.
Eventually, someone will say yes.
Why didn't the guy in charge know about it?
Faggie
Hoping to get lucky?
"I did not know the NSA was doing illegal
wiretapping."

 

"My immigration reform is not Amnesty."

 

"I plan on having a more transparent government."



He said that, really
My health care plan won't cost Americans an additional

"I saved Detroit."

"Benghazi was a random attack."
Most of the Americans dont? Are ju gay?
No one said McCain was in charge, dumb@$$$.  Why didn't he know about this?  You think no vet ever called his office to complain about it?
What?
And besides that Democrats are now pushing for Shitsekie to go. You know those who want to re-elected in November
#sodidsomefemalestaffers
Ahhh he is not in charge of the VA you dumb liberal
Fagggie
#a l o n e
I got the largest raises from Bill Clinton.
I hope you like standing alone.
Pointer for you: Who started Vietnam, and Korea?
FAK U
I will never vote Democrat again, these people are so utterly incompetent...
That is you, mac. Not all vets!
"I will have the most transparent administration in history" To bad the death lists are not that.....
he knows "what his son would look like......"  ..... if he had a son.
It is good when the world sees how incompetent the USA is.  It is good when the US loses prestige.  The more Obama denies responsibility, the more the Americans are revealed to be a pack of renegade heathens without order, discipline, or responsibility.  It is good Obama denies responsibility.  It shows the world how rabid Americans are. 
We would have not the problems we have now ! McCain 2016!
What DOES Obama actually know, other than his tee time?
 My Wife waited over a year for a VA claim. She proudly served this country for 30 years. Our Government cant run anything efficiently or correctly. 
Vets died and Obama lied
It is good when American institutions treat Americans murderously unethical.  You see, Americans accept abortion, human sacrifices, for American lust, pride, and greed.  The American harvest will hurt
they used to.  it has gotten worse over the past decade.  I worked as a VA primary care physician for 10 yrs.  it's gotten worse.
Vets died and Obama lied. Again
'Twould seem neither of you is old enough to vote anyway, hmm?
Obama and Shitsekie need to go, ho ho , need to go
Obama needs to go!
Resign Shitsekie and better take Obama and Holder with you.
Sure see in November you liberal trash
I enjoy waiting 6 hours in the ER along with the guy who's been waiting 8 to treat the gushing wound in his arm, all while children who have been waiting 5 hours continue to puke everywhere and cry. All this on top of the 100 degree heat because the Army needs to save a few dollars on electricity.......
Brought to you by the fine folks who brought Obamacare....
Congratulations on being so healthy, you hit the gene pool lottery. How much do you pay for insurance each month? Do you think someone making 20 grand a year with kids or dependents can pay that?

The #1 cause of bankruptcy is medical bills, nearly 80% had insurance. The reason we haven't made reforms is that the young and healthy don't have to deal with the ridiculous supercharging hospitals or the pre approving of insurance companies. The young and healthy have all the energy to protest and demand change and by the time they realize change is needed it's too late for them.

Insurance paid my bill as well, but do you really think 2,000$ is fair for an x-ray and ace bandage? Keep in mind you can buy a pretty good x-ray machine for 40,000$. No way someone uninsured making 20000$ a year can fork over 2000$.
not true...but you keep hater mongering the issue.  do some research...you will find this has been there for years long before the head moozlim in charge took office...you will also find the repubes cut spending and cost to our veterans...go ahead ...look it up...i will wait...
Lie
Obvious you've never had to 'lead' a group of people who simply do not like, respect, or want your leadership - who, from day one, plan on your ouster and attempt to set you up to fail and infiltrated by a bunch of mindless insecure bigots!  Any 'Leader' who has to 'lead' a group of insane, bigoted, naysaying, hateful, insecure, and nonsensical people who care more for their own careers than those their efforts are supposed to enhance...would have a most difficult task.  The thing about you and those like you...you're quick to point a finger at anything that sounds negative in order to bolster your personal bias, but never once do you assign 'praise' when the man does or tried to do something good!  That's the telling trait of a 'hater' - the opposite of an "independent" mind who opposes a person based on 'thought' or 'policy'...a trait that does not allow them to pat anyone on the back for any job well-done!  And btw...when you sound like a partisan hack, walk like one, most likely that's exactly what your are.  Delude yourself no longer into thinking anything you do is 'independent'!  :)
My VA's great had all kinds of things performed,$8 dollar prescriptions. Regular blood and labs done. longest I've ever had to wait is an hour. Mental health program is good. Hell even the chows good at my VA. Is it perfect no? does it need some revision? yes They'll need to be revised. Some are just better than others.
Tell that to ones that died waiting for care and the 1700 in this article.  This is just 1 VA hospital.  Let me guess you don't use the VA!
Neo-cons are the worst type of people and probably won't go to heaven.
This comment thread is filled with unemployed Neo cons waiting for a republican president to start another war and get contracting jobs with the government.
Make a claim, but when challenged, not willing to do any research to support the claim.  What if he made $0?
You probably got some useless liberal arts education at some college nobody has heard of.
If that's the best you can come up with, please don't bother.
Never had any schooling :(
i wish i was as smart as you lol. bye
Why would you call the man a name because he likes his VA?
No idea who youve been talking to, the healthcare sucked when I was in and its twice as bad as a vet. For the record, I wasnt one of the four year short timers in it for the college money either, I had the benefit of 14yrs of govt run healthcare.
I was responding to a comment made by Mac,that was all,Didn't mean to upset you
Quit deflecting the question. What type of degree do you have?
"Oh yea? what do degree do you possess, sir?"...reread that slowly. Didn't i tell you how smart you were? Issac Newton has nothing on you.
Too many MOOzlims in the White House screwing things up on purpose.  Following their Sheeeryai Looow
Irrelevant. The result is the same whether he made $1 or enough to last the rest of his life.
I've had private sector health care.  I am eligible for and use the VA healthcare system.  I am eligible for private sector health care right now, but I turned it down.  Why?  Because my private sector health care was so poor (cost wasn't really the issue) that I figured the VA couldn't be worse.  My local VA is a lot better than the private sector, at least for me. 

Yes, there was a period when I experienced long wait times, rescheduled appointments and difficulties in getting an appointment.  That was prior to 2007, and part of it was because my primary care physician had just had major surgery and was still recovering.

I like my "government health care".  But then, I liked the health care I received as a child and later as a tourist (in 2004) under England's National Health Service (NHS).
and dem Blacks
Oh yea? what do degree do you possess, sir?
When and how much did Cheney make from Halliburton during that time?  Before you answer, you may want to do so REAL research.
And them gays
You mean constitutional republic, thank God.
smartest comment of the internet. I bet your IQ is off the charts!!
A majority of one.
America is a bankrupt nation and a failed democracy.  Too many christian red necks are on welfare.
Too young to remember, just remember driving to leavenworth and seeing lots of guys in uniform. 

Saying there wasn't headaches is exaggerating a bit. Mom cried and stressed plenty. The good thing though was that he isn't spending the rest of his life in debt. Or being forced into bankruptcy like so many others who wind up with health issues.

I read that health care bills are now the leading cause of bankruptcy in America and 80% had insurance. Sad state affairs, I won't argue that ACA is a cure-all but working as physician who serves poor and uninsured almost exclusively I know we need reforms. ACA has actually been a big pain for me.
No, she can't get into the tanning booth -- Boehner won't leave.
The article  wasn't about how GOOD the VA care has been for some or many. I asked why you were ignoring it's point, asked two questions, is asking why twisting or dismissing what has happened ?
CNN broke the story.
Why all the FOXies flock to CNN for their news?
But hey, on the "bright" side, Cheney's Halliburton Corp. netted a cool $38 Billion on the unnecessary, bungled Iraq war and occupation -- much of it in no-bid contracts.


"Mission Accomplished!"
No nuts in the mommy pants
Agreed. I didn't like waiting 5 months for an MRI before I could continue with treatment. I don't like jumping through hoops for two months just to get an appointment with the chiropractor that I've been seeing for 5 years.
Obama's left nut has more brain than you and your dog
Bush's fault for sure.
Ben Gazzi?
To funny
McCain should be impeached.  He is a liar and senile
Then find something else.
The VA doesn't treat active duty Marines, JUST SAYIN'.
grouchy grandpa
I'm a vet and I have received good care - lifesaving, in fact.  However, I have encountered some staffing issues that I have been told were linked to budget cuts.   I guess I'll have to accept that - tax cuts for the wealthiest among us are so much more important than our care - NOT! Kills me here how so many are appalled at the situation in AZ, as they should be, but apparently don't give a damn when VA funding suffers.  Where have you been!?  Hypocrites, I say.
Try living in a place where the recreational pastime of the people surrounding your base is to lob mortars into your compound. Try sleeping at night when you spent a year reacting to every sound as if it were incoming enemy fire.


How about you watch some documentaries about Afghanistan and tell me how mentally perfect you would be when you come home. Documentaries like "Restrepo". You might start considering those "Xanax" jokes a little inappropriate.
Former Marine here...


When I was in the Corps, the VA hospital just gave us aspirin.


<i>-Just sayin'<i/>
You are an ObamaDouchebag
Im glad you dad got the proper care. Was his insurance Tricare? that is a huuuuge difference than the VA healthcare system
I'm not rich and my health insurance pays for just about everything.
Novel
Just as long as I get my Xanax.
That's how everyone feels about their healthcare. Well except rich people, but I'd prefer not paying $2,000.00 for an x-ray and ace bandage. That's what I get for thinking I broke my ankle I guess.

Give me military healthcare any day. My dad had a brain tumor removed and years of physical therapy: no charge, no problem! Ex-marine.

Greedy people will screw up even the best systems. Just like what happened here, but at least when we catch it, people work to fix it. There are no checks and balances in private care unless you live in a big city.
Both VA and Tricare are horrible.  It would be much easier to just give every veteran a normal health insurance plan for life.  It's obviously to difficult to maintain a separate health care system.
There's a reason we call Trippler Medical Center, Crippler.
obamas on the job....
Go back to mommies basement and wait on your welfare check, troll.
so, if the majority of vets like their VA healthcare, does this justify keeping as it is? If yes, then why wasnt that logic applied to folks who lost their healthcare as a result of the ACA? Hmmm?
You can't even spell "majority" correctly @disqus_z858v9kuto:disqus . Please speak for yourself as all veterans do not agree with you.
The military does have a distinctive feel of working for "the government" these days rather than for the nation, the constitution or the people.  It seems to be the "government enforcer" rather than a protector of the nation.
True. We are arguing with t3abillies. Facts get in the way of their "I hate the black man in the white house" agenda.
Sure they do Ace!
You should probably look a litter harder at that 2013 independent survey you cite as you are spreading disinformation. Please look at the population that was surveyed. You will find only those that were treated in a VA facility were given the survey with about an 85 percent satisfaction score. If you remember correctly, the people that are upset or dead were never treated at these facilities and were placed on secret wait lists. I guess if they had actually been treated they would be satisfied, but instead they were not seen and died. That is an awfully big disparity in satisfaction. I would bet those that were not seen or died are not too satisfied.
Should have thought about that before joining the army and risk your life for the government 
Well then sucks to be you, goof
I cannot install AdBlock on some of the computers I use.


Don't be a goof.
ADBLOCK. Dont be a goof
bull. my uncle had no injuries form ww2 and used the VA
AdBlock
The veteran system is less comprehensive and more administrative than active duty care.  That's all I need to know.
I would beg to differ... the vets I deal with on a daily basis love their healthcare and the way they are taken care of and are tired of the VA being painted in such a bad light..not all VA's are bad and some of us love to take care of and do the best we can to help
Your wording is very...political. The correct wording would be, a majority of vets like their healthcare coverage. There is a huge difference between the two statements.
You must have taken one of those polls to get your results.  You know the ones the news stations throw out all the time where they contact a couple hundred people and then show a + or - 3% error factor, and then quote, "All Americans Believe".
Vets only get full coverage for ailments/injuries caused by their military service.
Well I like my Tricare :) It does differ in what branch . Most navy I know like the care.
then a get a job and get coverage yourself like anyone else.
FAIL
Are you a vet?  Have you even stepped inside a VA?  You are probably another lib that wants more tax $ for schools but send yours to private schools
How does Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson feel about Obama being half-white? Obama's evil white blood is coursing through his veins. His mother's side of the family probably owned slaves, too. Keeping the black man down.
if the executive order says to treat the needy at VA hospitals, and VA hospitals are the ones turning them away, then executive orders are not worth the paper they are written on.
Oh..he's Hawaiian now? I thought he was black.
Speak for yourself VA-run healthcare or any govt-run healthcare is deplorable. As a veteran, I'll go with my private insurer if its all the same to you! My father would agree with me and he served in Vietnam. So, talk what you know and not what you think you know.
The research is in. No they don't.
I like how you ignore the executive orders passed that do help the vets.
This proves the government does not care about vets.
Yes, it's been an ongoing practice that Obama let go on for 5 and a half years after he found out about it.


The fact that it's been going on for decades doesn't excuse Obama for letting it continue on his watch.
We know that if you want to get placed in the hold file, just even start complaining.
Familiar with the concept of leadership? Leadership is getting people, who are determined not to work with you, to do so anyway.


You may notice that going on national TV to insult the people who don't want to work with you, isn't leadership.
Dude - facts don't matter here!

So why are you attacking my civil rights?  Don't you believe I have a right to speech, worship, and assembly?  You must be one of those 19th Century Marxist.
he probably should resign, but that won't solve anything.
Yeah, rather than a Hawaiian.
silly girl
AMEN
After 230 members of the house and 43 members of the senate resign. Obama has asked for more resources EVERY YEAR, and in February, Mr. McSHAME joined 42 other republiCONs in filibustering money for the VA.
As long as those Americans you are refering to want to start another WAR where thousand of  Americans DIE.  That will NOT happen
Well, there are some inaccuracies in your post.


Bush cut taxes on all Americans (that paid taxes).


It did stimulate the economy, and the US quickly recovered from the recession.

Ah ha!!!  I knew it....

There's a double secret list to get on to the list!

Shinseki, just resign....just resign
Was that a government survey?  Because I know about 15 vets and none of them are happy.  Your undying love for Obama is pathetic.  Welcome to government run health care.  Obamacare is not going to get better because the V.A. has been around for decades.
Next time, maybe Democrats will vote an American into the presidency.
I would have to substitute "like" for "tolerate"
It must be a very silent majority.  I have 2 siblings that are vets and my father, none are wealthy and all would spend their last dollar not to go to the VA hospital.
Blaming Bush? Sorry but this involves every veteran from every war and peace time involvement who is alive so blaming Bush only shows your ignorance.
I wanted to give a positive account of my Dad's experience with the VA.  He was laid off in 1993.  By 1996, he was without any healthcare benefits and had some nagging health issues.  I forced him to start the process of getting into the VA's system. In 1998, he was diagnosed with bladder cancer.  The care he recieved was very good - even when he moved completely across the country and went to a different VAMC. He is still kicking and going to the VA and is thankful for the care he receives.  I will say this, you do have to understand the process to get the most out of it.     To those affected,  my sympathies - hopefully the system can be improved.
IHS (Indian Health System), is also government run and equally deplorable if not worse.  From direct experience.  I work in a clinic on the res and am native.  Government is terribly inefficient in some things, like providing healthcare.
I heard the 1700 werent very satisfied customers
Romney said he would do that, too.
He really should tights them instead.
how about the CIVIL one we are on the brink of?
This isn't true.
No he just LOOSES them!
He supplied weapons to terrorists in Syria and almost got us in there.
McCainisatoothlessclosetgaylordsuckoffjerkoffuselessfuck
Obama didn't start a war.
Can't ask some of them, because they died while waiting for an appointment to be treated.
You know what'll really help the VA deal with budget problems? Not starting wars. McCain and Obama should resign along with Shinseki.
Really don't care what he is.  Time for him to go.
Shenseki is McCain's boy-toy he hates so much firing
VA---Very Awful.  Active Duty/Retired...Tri-and-get-Care.
Because you ingested fresh herbs?
Obama's butcher of Vets, Shenseki must go now !
My father went to the VA once.  He said he got better care from his field medic.
Yep... The 1700 that were never given an appointment must really love their healthcare.
That "majority" likes the cost and nothing else.  It is a horribly inefficient system trying to deal with too many people.  It would be much more efficient if they would just implement an 
insurance policy that would allow veterans to go wherever they like.
mac, you would be incorrect.
Most vets "deal" with healthcare as that is all they have.  The only option they have, and something is better than nothing.  Similar to the "poor" who will now have free healthcare (free being relative) due to the ACA..
What about Walter Mondale or Michael Dukakis?
Those who aren't dying while they wait to receive the care in the first place!
I have been waiting to see a doctor for 6 months now. The VA in San Antonio has stalled getting me an appointment and new doctor at every turn. No one has helped. Not even the Patient Advocate Office.
Heck I would even take Jimmy Cater
Among other places.
It can, and should be, much better.  Access to civilian benefits as seen in the corporate world is what they deserve.
I took a look at your page, gratitude to God is near to the beginning of all wisdom, and maybe it the other side of the coin that is the beginning of all wisdom.  Mr Tom GI, May The Lord bless you, keep you,  be gracious to  you,  and give  you and your family peace that surpasses human understanding . 
Liberals and democrats would have a field day over that
McCain wants troops anywhere and everywhere someone stubs a toe. Its time for the voters of Arizona to retire him.
Obama did send troops to Nigeria.
And McCain wants to send US Troops to Nigeria.? Wonder what profit he's making from it?
That's BS. I had a torn muscle and and was given antibiotics because my "pain was caused by folliculitis (irritation from the ace wrap the medic gave me a week before)". It took a civilian doctor's diagnosis, paid for out of my own pocket, before anyone took me seriously. This is an active duty story.  My VA experiences haven't been bad once I made it through the initial waiting list, which was 26 months.
Medicare?  What are you talking about??
I really hate to say it but I would take Bill Clinton for our president to fill out Obama's last remaining two years
"...and the former was a phony, and the latter was a fake!" from "Casey at the Bat."
Reading the VA Inspector General report (on the main page of their website) this has been going on and been known about as far back as 2005 when it was noted that "Nationwide electronic wait lists could be understated by as many as 10,000 veterans" and that the "VHA lacks standardized training programs for scheduling" and that there was "Insufficient oversight".

Subsequent reports on a yearly basis showed the same issues. This is nothing new and both "sides" have known about it for a while and done little but talk..
Right...only presidents that can guarantee that no wrongdoing will ever be done or exposed.
anybody with their last names..
Well yes, because you can only serve 2 terms, then you're done forever.
WEAK DEMOCRAT OVERSIGHT = MORE HENSLEY WAR PROFITS?
Bush, Clinton, and Obama never again
that's baloney
McCain is so full of it 

Using an arms length distance from his wifes assets to shield himself from conflict of interest problems, McCain released only a two-page summary from his wifes separate 2006 federal income taxes which were filed six months late via an IRS-approved extension, after which Mrs. McCain received a 2007 tax extension until October 15, 2008just 19 days before the November 4 presidential election in 2008unless she files for an additional extension to hide the profits until after the election.

Kind of odd.  Why not just go single payer from the get-go?
While Americans squabble like rabble children amid accusations and denials, the nations and people of the world see the mounting American incompetence and the mounting moral degeneration of the USA
If it's not too much trouble, would you please tell us one thing that Sarah Palin was actually right about.
Sorry to say but I just can't seem to consider your statement nonsense.  It rings true to me.
If they have million's don't vote for them!
Everybody I know knew about it and has for decades. Except for a US Senator of 27 years and a veteran himself apparently. The guy who voted against VA funding and is now trying to place the blame elsewhere as you are. Congress is to blame for this.
Yeah, let's let the private sector run it!  Oh, wait:
"DENTON, Texas -              

A former employee is accusing a Denton hospital of not only neglecting a  patient, but attempting a cover up after a man died in the emergency room. 

Richard Evans, a husband and father, was taken to Denton Regional Medical  Center in 2013. He had constipation. Hours later, he was dead.  

A former employee at the hospital claims the hospital fired her because she  was trying to tell the truth about what really happened to Evans."
Our politicians are full of shite.
What government healthcare are you referring to?
It's a good thing we have government health care......... O wait
In more shocking allegations which media and Democratic congressional leaders have failed to investigate, a U.S. intelligence authority with scores of federal contacts, said federal agents also know that Mrs. McCain made millions in insider short-sale profits involving Swiss re-insurance put option stock orders placed prior to the September 11 attacksprofits of death which have remained untaxed by the U.S. government and raise questions as to her 9/11 tip-off.
Americans have been spending more than a trillion USD per year on defense.  Americans don't count NSA, CIA, NASA expenditures designated for military satellites, cyber security, oceanographic expenditures designed to facilitate navy operations, Homeland Security  etc.  Americans are ignorant.  They are also very vulnerable.  The more moving parts an engine has, the more opportunity for mishap.  But the death of the US will not be mishap.  A God the USA denies is breaking the USA down, and when He is ready, He will destroy your nation.  
Every President since Nixon has known about it and done squat.  The complaints go back further than that.  So don't side with the GOP especially since this round started in a GOP state.
Single payer, this is what liberals are planning. Obamacare was just an interim step.
You really need to get up on the history of this. This has been happening for decades. I know you feel you need to blame somebody but at least get it right.
I think they can contract that out
he would just cover his behind
They probably do considering the majority of vets DO NOT rely on the VA. If you think they do then you haven't done YOUR research.
WashingtonAccording to a high-placed federal agent actively based in Washington, DC who spoke with federal whistleblower Stewart Webb, Republican presidential candidate and Senate Armed Services Ranking Member John McCains wife Cindy Hensley McCains multiple undisclosed federal income tax returns will reveal millions in Iraq War military procurement contract profits involving Hensley & Co. (Hensley Beer), Mrs. McCains large Anheuser-Busch beer distribution firm.
Dumb biatch troll somewhere else
And you want them to build a border fence?
Secret list, 1700 patients with even an appointment, what are they covering up there?
Since when?  The number 19 hardly is "many".  The number of veterans in Congress has significantly decreased.
Obama is not that bad of a president. All he did was make America into a laughing stock
Federal agents: Cindy McCains full tax returns will show war profits, pre-9/11 insider trading, secret off-shore accounts linked to 1241 Class C Nevada corporation payoffs and bribes (Real Corp Realty)
I have an appointment with mine on Friday.
That's ridiculous. This has been a problem for decades. You know who's been in office for decades? John McCain. And he votes against VA funding. And if you take the time to listen to veterans most know this. John McCain has been a US Senator for 27 years and that's been plenty of time to fund and create legislation to fix this problem. He's part of the problem not a piece of the solution. You are misplacing your blame. And not aware of the history of this problem perhaps?
Children died and Ted Cruz lied, but you're cool with that.
Brought to you by the folks who brought Obamacare. Big government, big problems.
Three words....... Bush did it
So, please tell us how the NRA is at fault?
You can not blame Bush on everything
But, but Obama did not know.....
nieve are you...there was bad stuff in that desert, and to cover it up...slow treatment down...
Obama lied about nothing
Ignorant piglets try to blame everyone but those at fault. Phoenix az VA
Kurt Vonnegut described a "jerk" as someone off to the side playing with himself. I define it as a "capitalist."
He most certainly did so did Clinton, Bush1 and Ronny Raygun
You can keep your doctor. Period.
BUSH>OBAMA
You're thinking of Bush, Cheney, Rice, Rumsfeld and Powell. Try to keep up.
You re right....it is an "America" problem, not a party specific problem
Jesus Christ
he was apart of it...
Veterans died and Obama lied. Again
What about the VA hospitals that have no crisis?  Obviously, this horror is state by state.
and Cheney and Rumsfeld and Perlman etc....
Why worry about the veterans? How about the mentally impaired or physically disabled? Everybody loves RR, but he closed down the mental hospitals and set up facilities to hand out drugs to people that won't take them and end up buying guns to go postal! (thanks NRA). "That's a wonderful catch that Catch 22!" "it's the best there is!"
My brother received $1100 in a class action suit against DuPont after a stroke from Agent Orange. The government gave him sh*t! Why is this news?
He didn't.
Anonymous surveys over decades, with many different vets responding across all regions are saying the same thing - they like their care at the VA.
"A government by the people and for the people shall not perish from the earth." The fact is the despise between democrats and republicans is actually healthy. We live in a country in which differences of opinions are encouraged. And that we can criticize either side without the fear of being arrested or tortured. We have a large amount of wealth, maybe not as distributed as some would like. You are nuts if you think America is about to collapse.
Outrageous! Resign ! And take Obama with you!
Just that he sets my "gaydar" off big time.
You're in the wrong forum.
I can't believe Bush would let this happen
That is true. For decades now, the numbers indicate that most vets like the care they receive from the VA. And many return often. That is well documented.
Not so, they were just taught not to complain.
This was happening long before Obama, yet it is now a thorn in his side for you to poke him with.
My taxes go to GAO office parties.  I'm kinda mad they put an end to those.
BUSH!
My taxes go to treat our vets so give them the care I pay for.
Bush did it
nah...just white people...lol
Is China and Japan about to get into it ? :) I mean with a war not the VA :)
I know a vet and he was treated for many ailments over several decades. He is alive because of VA treatment.
Amen ... our CIC is not acting like a CIC.  He must be out playing golf somewhere...
still the best comment I ever read you posted  yesterday
In America, no one is responsible.  The USA is a nation of heathen renegades.  God is draining the USA of its competence, discipline, wealth, and prestige.  God is giving these treasures to other nations.  When God is finished bleeding the US comes sudden, utter, and final death.  The USA will not exist as a nation.  Its name, lands, and people will be gone.  They cannot imagine what is coming.  The USA has rebelled and been making war upon God.  God is not a liar that Americans should mock Him, and use their God given treasures to beguile the nations, and provoke them to join the USA's Satanic rebellion..  God mocks the USA. God causes the US to be incompetent, yet, America remains smug. America will surely die swiftly just like Goliath.  One swift motion.  There will be no chance to respond.  America will drop dead completely destroyed from where it stands as it is boasting.  The government, and ALL the America institutions will die.  
He's partially to blame for invading Iraq for no good reason.
ha just scroll down mane.  The progressive crazies will never give up their man.
I guess they will blame Bush for all of this
I did...I'm one of them...I don't.
Because congress vets do not have to go to the VA. They have the best health insurance in the US.
"I will  not have it", I read it in the news. Just like all the other scandals
How can Congress treat the Vets this way since many of them were Vets themselves?
lol... that's your defense? I'm sorry, this is Obama's responsibility. He was elected to lead. Leading doesn't mean working with those who want to work with you. Leading means convincing those who are determined not to work with you, to do so.


For the record, I'm an independent. I'm not part your partisan games.
This will slide by Obama, he is partly to blame for knowing about it and not doing anything as with the other Presidents.
Do you know any vets?  I am one and know plenty more and the healthcare is garbage.  


Just a tip...when you have no idea what you're talking about it's best to keep your mouth shut.
My father, a military vet, has been turned away from the VA for an abdominal aortic aneurysm but his private health insurance provider sent him straight to surgery and this saved his life. If he relied on the VA, he would not be here today.
Fire everybody who is in charge at any VA hospital or in DC
What is the PRESIDENT supposed to do when CONGRESS is the one who pays the bills?
I've heard nothing but complaints from veterans.  Besides weather the majority likes it or not isn't relevant.  The majority of Americans liked their healthcare before the ACA too, but we got the ACA anyways.
Have a clue, then post.
Yes, most vets do. The numbers have painted the same picture for decades now.
Why is it so hard for YOU to understand the man isn't a magician - he can't 'fix' anything without the help and $$ afforded by CONGRESS!  Also, like most people, you expect THIS President to fix EVERYTHING wrong with America or he's "unfit for office" - as though the pressing problems he found were those he inherited!  SO, even though Bush knew about the problems - in your mind, he gets a pass on responsibility??  Hmmm...so, if the next President in 2016 is a Republican...let's see how much 'unfixed' problems you no longer blame on Obama and say it's HIS responsibility!  Yeah, that's gonna happen!  YOU understand that if you bought a burnt out house, can't get the money from those who control the purse, can't get any help from anyone to help rebuild it, can't get any fresh or new ideas on how to fix up the house from that other side - HOW in the hell are you supposed to fix the house??  Obama is governing with one hand tied behind his back - YOUR side isn't governing at all!  They're good at the blame game, but terrible at resolving anything!  Tell me...what HAS your side done about ANYTHING since 2010?  ~cricket chirping~!  Regarding the VA, you do realize that the Republicans voted against funds to help the organization back in February, right?  41 Republicans voted against a sweeping bill to help veterans!!
They deserve it.
Republicans block closing Guanatanamo, and then complain that it's not closed.
Republican hypocrisy is endless.
what a wonderful president he is ;)
No, we don't. Do YOUR research!
Yes, and we also found WMD in Iraq.
but now it has exploded in obamas face...stop blaming and stand up and lead
Obama has told you repeatedly...he gets his news from MSM and didn't know anything until they told him about it!
Obama's executive orders giving vets better access to mental health care and education and job opportunities prove it!
Hey, it's okay for government officials to lie.  After all, we closed Guantanamo.  Didn't we?
When did Bush become a liberal?
I am sure the ones died waiting were not polled...
The VA system has improved vastly under Obama....1700 facilities...8.76 millions Vets served...amazing developments in care of war wounded...attracting a much higher level of physician...the success must irk you....funding cuts can be attributed to the GOP
see, this administration is letting down women AND veterans
As Hillary would say - what difference does it make.
Then cries "FORWARD" by the man himself.
Most Presidents are guilty of doing absolutely nothing about this since they knew about these problems.
yes and it works ;) We are talking about veterans who fought for our nation and came back home with horrible healthcare sponsored by our government. Who's at the top of the government.... you guessed it president Obama. If Obama just took very little time to read what was happening in the VA there healthcare probably would have changed or if he did read what was happening and not care until the media brought it up. The free will thing could be debated.. There are theory's that everything we do is always predetermined.
Freedom in Iraq? We gave it for free to Iraqis.
I think Obama took over a train wreck of an economy.  I also think that in 5 years, he should have been able to generate something more than slowing the slide.  And before the finger pointing at Congress starts, all Presidents have to deal in a two party system.  The walls of obstruction have been built by both parties.
Women have over a year waiting period to be seen after being raped in some cases.
Obama needs to draw a line in the sand for evaluating when Shinseki must go... oh wait...forget that.
Do you have proof or are you just basing that on your own prejudice?
That she really does read every magazine and newspaper in existence?
Those numbers are classified, like the satisfied customers of Obamacare!
So the private market place can milk our govenment for all it's worth.  Remeber teh $800 toilet seat in the 80's?
They were hiding the stats FROM the administration. Geez
Liberals have always hated American Troops. This is no big thing for them.
When it comes to other people's lives and money, there is no end to how much our government is willing and able to squander.
And precisely where would one "research" the percentage of Veterans who like their healthcare?
IT's because it's in their nature to persevere and to follow orders.  They hurry up and wait and deal with nonsense and wait and generally get mistreated and forgotten about..
Sure.Ever try to steer a kid in the right direction??? :)
We are talking about thousands of people working in these places every day..
If ONLY he had that kind of power.. Wow..
And if he did, then what if we had a evil man for president?
Good thing I guess people do have free will , huh? And a president can't control every single person in the USA!
Carter's economy was in the toilet...Reagan got it back on track (unlike Obama's inability to deal with the mess Bush left him).  And, last time I checked, all anyone does is blame Bush for the current economy.  I don't blame Obama for the economy he inherited.  I blame him for the lack of a recovery given 5 years to get things on track.  Let me guess your response...Republican led House's fault, right?  God forbid the Chief Exec take responsibility.
I guess he lied on that to
How many vets will Obama kill before He finally admits Sarah Palin was right?
Does the president of GE now what every worker is doing in China....I don't see you holding the head of JP Morgan responsible for the action of every trader.....
How many babies must Sarah Palin murder and eat for people to realize she is a monster!?
You apparently hate our vets?
It is sick that our soldiers put their lives up on  the line for our freedom and their treated like this.
Lindsey Graham is clearly gay.
Here's a clue: WE are the government. If you don't vote...then you shouldn't gripe. If you chose unwisely in past elections...then you've been better educated for the next.
yea exactly, obama couldnt be bothered with such middling problems
but it does give you the power to steer America in the right direction
And who would they be or are you just making up stuff?
This is so local that it does not get bumped up to the WH....re: there are 1700 VA facilities that serve 8.76 million Vets annually.
OK, Now I know you are joking>>
So just simplify this.. At any school how many kids pull of stunts that the principle had no clue about until happened..?
Well..there you go..
Being president doesn't give him super powers..:)
so, for the first months of Obama's administration, he had Dem House and Dem Senate.
You FAIL
News alert....Obama says he has just learned of existence of Arizona VA hospital from news report.  He is vowing to investigate.
Now Obama's killing our vets. 
 
All Chris Christie did was close a bridge.
He is the president ;)
Bush isn't President and what he knew or didn't know is currently irrelevant.


Obama knew about this for 5 and a half years, and did nothing. We know that for a fact. 


Obama deserves the blame for what he didn't do. Why is that so hard to understand?
Sure.. How did he not know what some guy at the end of a thousand person line was doing?? :(
Well he doesn't know any things going on... He gets his news from cnn come on Keep up
Speak for yourself pal.
I thought Obama was going to bring the troops home. He is still working on it after five years. Yes, Bush was a horrible president
The problem is the existence of the VA itself. All politicians are accountable for not dismantling this wasteful and inefficient government program long ago.
Republican or Liberal doesn't matter.  He should have taken some action on this long ago.
I'm sure he'll make up some mystery math to answer that question.
How did Obama not know this was going on?????
They look just like you.
More than Bush
Abolish the VA. Maybe once people like McCain and Obama are out of office, we can get our spending under control and do away with wasteful, inefficient programs and move them to the private marketplace.
Sarah Palin was RIGHT and Obama was WRONG!!
Funny how the military didn't miss anyone for the list when it was time to get on the planes....
The question is ... how many veterans has Obama saved?
Well they are use to lying their sicko heads off so why not.
Lying Obama doesn't really give a DAMN about these Vets, He only cares about the Bad Press.
Democrats can take full control if they run with it that Republicans voted against our Vets.
But it IS Obama's fault that he let it continue under his watch, after knowing about it 5 and a half years ago.
What a liar!
He's a RINO. He's not up for re-election and not running again in '16, he's showing his true liberal colors if you look at how he votes and what he says lately.
Oh, please.  How many veterans did Bush kill?  And Sarah Palin hasn't been right about anything.  Ever.
Democrats you need to learn from this and run with it that the Republicans do not care about the Vets
So, let me get this straight: You are equating the CRIMINAL acts of VA administrators with an issue of just funding? Do you still take a bottle before bed-time?
.
Wrong healthcare program again Michelle!!
Neither has Obama! LOL......
Republicans blocked it all because of sanctions to Iran?
Even if he did all that, he failed at the most important thing.....helping vets.
.
As always more BS than substance.
Thank you that is my whole point. To me they want to keep bringing up Bush, I mean if Hillary wins can she blame Bush too. By the way I am neutral on Bush. I think he made a lot of mistakes, I just like how he handled those mistakes.
Our government screws up everything it touches. They can't even capture the traitor Edward Snowden and we expect them to take quality care of our veterans. How ridiculous.
Funny...I hardly remember hearing the amount of whining from his administration on the news and other media outlets. But I guess you must have played chess with the man and listened to him gripe. I guess the ultimate blame goes on George Washington, for he has nobody to blame and it should fall on his shoulders since nobody needs to be held accountable. Benghazi, IRS targeting, dividing the races further, VA nonsense...all Washington's fault.
Yeah, and then we start anew. I don't care about any of these pigs.
Most in DC are gay.
It would have to be a lot because I am not sure she has ever been right about anything
ummm - 9/11 was a little more obvious than some VA hospitals covering up their incompetence don't you think?  I don't blame Bush directly for 9/11, but intelligence was certainly lacking.  The entire US economy folded affecting MILLIONS.  The VA issue while bad, is a speck of sand compared to the US recession
Obama Lied. Vets Died. 
 
Sarah Palin was RIGHT about Death Panels!
Its sort of like why are Republican Senators who are gay against homosexuals?
How many veterans must Obama kill before He admits He was wrong and Sarah Palin was RIGHT?
Spoken like a person that has never talked with a vet.
No one gives a hoot what McCain has to say about anything. He's lucky he's not up for re-election this year or the voters would boot him out like the RINO he is. Another big-government, big-spending establishment conservative.
tell your senator or complain about him like we do Obama.   I didn't like Bush either but it doesn't justify Obama's shortcomings. Didn't your parents teach you two wrongs don't make a right?
Those pig politicians from both side of the isle must be kicked out.
Can't wait for our inevitable single payer health care system....
Why would John McCain a hero to our nation be against the VA just look at his record with the VA?
You are correct.  As a candidate in 2008, Obama said the department would need to make 
progress on four fronts to meet his definition of "national leader in 
health reform:


		Improve electronic records interoperability;



		Expand effectiveness research;

		Promote wellness programs;

		Instill more accountability for performance and quality improvement initiatives.
So far he's accomplished many of his lofty goals, had a few stalled and others failed.


Increase the Veterans Administration budget to recruit and retain more mental health professionals - DONE


Expand Veterans Centers in rural areas - DONE


Fully fund the Veterans Administration -  DONE


Assure that the Veterans Administration budget is prepared as 'must-pass' legislation - DONE


Expand the Veterans Administration's number of "centers of excellence" in specialty care - DONE


Expand housing vouchers program for homeless veterans - DONE


Launch a supportive services-housing program for veterans to prevent homelessness - DONE


Dedicate more resources to fight employment discrimination against military reservists - DONE


Create a 'Green Vet Initiative' to promote environmental jobs for veterans - DONE


Institute electronic record-keeping for the Veterans Benefits Administration - COMPROMISED


Allow all veterans back into the Veterans Administration - COMPROMISED


Establish standards of care for traumatic brain injury treatment - COMPROMISED


Reduce the Veterans Benefits Administration claims backlog - FAILED

Point being these were all issued that were present and growing before he came into office.  The Veterans Administration was not a shining beacon of success and efficiency in 2008.
Death Panels? Every doctor in every hospital makes daily decisions about access to care.....you don't give a $40K cancer treatment to a 85 year old with Alzheimer's....but you do give it to a 30 year old....you don't do a CT on a person who is not a surgical candidate or will benefit from treatment....
Does a fish flip flop out of water?
I am a vet and I work for the VA and the majority of Veterans I encounter as an employee and patient would prefer private medical treatment. MGK is sopt on for about 90% of the people I dealt with in Albuquerque, NM and now deal with in the New Orleans area.
We won't make it!
pppppfffffftttttttHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Oh....oh man....I just choked on my lunch a little....thanks for the laugh!
It's good to see that at least some of America is waking up against these forces. That's a positive.
Wrong program!!
You are the trashbags that uphold Obama's lies and even condone them
NO we don't!
I heard about long waiting lists for veterans in almost every VA hospital. DC was about the worst.
Sarah Palin was RIGHT about Death Panels.
 
That proves Palin is smarter than Obama.
I'm sorry they are fighting another fight here at home. I've had mine as well.
I'm a disabled veteran in Denver, and the VA here is doing a great job.  I do know the Denver VA sees an average of 6000 patients a day, which is a lot.  The most pressing thing here, I believe, is the lack of parking, and which has been greatly expanded in the future hospital currently under construction.  There are also issues with the new VA they are building, cost overruns and delays, but that is a whole other topic.
vote on age not political party. 65 and under 26 and above
throwing money at it isn't solving the problem.  It's ineptness.
Obama is a good reason to not vote for any Democrat.  McCain is a good reason to not vote for any Republican.  
What's wrong with that?
The best way to deal with this b.s. is impeach Obama and get rid of all responsible at the V.A.  What a shameful way to treat our men and women in uniform!
Any time someone else decides if you get a chance or not is a death panel.   I just had a freind who needs a stomach, pancreas and liver translant.  She had to wait until a doctor approved her for the operation.  That was a death panel for her.
Obviously spoken by a NON vet.
Most Vets deal with the cards they are handed and dont put up a fuss. Its not they LOVE it or even to a lesser degree like it....they deal with what they have. By the headlines there are 1700 at least that arent real happy and we cant poll the ones that are dead still waiting. Obama recognized issues with the VA when he was running for President as he ran on fixing those things he identified as wrong. Well..........8 years later............The Va issues are eerily similar to the economy, Guitmo, transparency etc...... just the HOPE aspect of his circus. Maybe you should research some more!
Sarah Palin was wrong and you are a complete M0R0N!
one pig wears lipstick and the other is just a pig...
LOL>..."right" lol....
Sarah Palin was RIGHT!!
 
ObamaCare = Death Panels
I don't agree.
Do you feel the same about what Obama inherited? Unfunded wars in Iraq and Afghanistan leading to high and climbing debt levels, high unemployment, a stock market headed for the basement, etc.
Sadly, Liberals would rather throw money into the failed welfare system for people that don't even try to get jobs than aide our soldiers.
I live in Iowa and I have 2 brothers who are one 20 years and the other 32 years National Guard Vets. Both have war injuries and have been fighting tooth and nail to get benefits and medical care. The VA gets to decide if you qualify for benefits based on your injuries from war and its been a 18 months and still waiting for one brother and with the other brother they decided they are not paying for his injury anymore based on "We don't believe the specialist report that you personally paid for that we requested from you in the first place". They need to view ALL VA Hospitals, Benefit Applications regardless where you live.
Patriot Acts one and two got passed under Bush not Obama. Those two laws essentially gave away all of our civil rights.
"they" - source please?
or is the voices in your head starting again  :-)
You're a minority:
Take a back seat, Abe. You too, George. Ronald Reagan was the nation's greatest President, according to a new poll.
About 37% of Americans gave the Gipper a No.1 ranking in a pre-President's Day Gallup survey.
Abe Lincoln finished second with 14%, followed by Bill Clinton with 13%, John Kennedy with 11% and George Washington with 10%.
About 5% picked Barack Obama as the best.  ( I wonder who that 5% was?)

he also won two elections by the biggest landslides in American history
Meanwhile last week, 56,000 horribly selfish American women decided having a baby was too much of a bother...
Honest discussions with conservatives about the state of the entire system.


Too much, I know.
The other Filthy Faction just want to save money.
What no dems since 1971 were president?   What about Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton who served two terms.  You wouldn't want to forget they also had the opportunity to fix it and didn't now would you?  Bottom line it's both parties and we are all losers for following parties that don't actually give a fig about any of us, except as cash cows.
I guarantee you that when (if) the next president is a Republican, that people like you will blame everything on Obama, just like you do now.


What about some compromise to make things better?  Your kind voted over 50 times to repeal ACA, but not once did you try to improve it.  You slowed down the rollout of ACA and then complained that it didn't go smoothly.  Well guess what... It went smoothly in states that prepared (blue states).
This has been a problem for years.  Lousey care from the VA is nothing new
Filthy Progressives want to kill our veterans and spare our Criminals. Sick.
Grant was nothing but a drunk. LOL
And how many innocents have died or been wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan?  Over 100,000.  Yeah.  No comparison, eh?
They say about 20000 US male soldiers have been raped by their commanders or leader and the VA ignores it.
no they don't.  just used to getting crapped on
The VA has been inept forever and the Obama administration has been inept since it came to power.  What a combination
The ones that are happiest are probably the healthiest and have little need for elevated levels of care or service or attention....if you ask me if I LOVE my Mercedes...I'd say heck yeah..no maintenance til each 10,000 miles...but if one or more things break...you can bet my answer would be different....
Liberals despise our soldiers, what do you expect?
McCain Loves the camera. Any chance he gets. Even though he looks dumb and hideous.
Exactly! If you don't WANT to have to take CARE of Veterans then don't CREATE veterans in the first place.
The fact that we don't go around whining about it, doesn't mean we like it.
THIS is your ObamaCare, filthy Liberals.
We have a good military but not a great one but we could make it great.
It worked for G W Bush. He spent his entire 8 years blaming Clinton for everything under the sun.
Too bad the republicans offered unacceptable alternatives. McCain shot himself in the foot with Palin and Mitt was like a fish out of water.
You aren't a Republican?  You must call yourself a Libertarian, the party that doesn't know the meaning of it's own name.
Says the guy who doesn't even SPELL incompetent correctly. LOL
Too bad Congress failed to function during those times as well. Incredibly, they bear a large part of the responsibility for bringing this nation to it's knees. Ya see, the President doesn't originate bills and the Congress has the authority to over ride a Presidential veto. Not familiar with the party of NO?
Most of the veterans I have been acquainted with have Tricare. They don't need to deal with the VA hospitals. The best thing to do is to figure out a way to stay out of the VA hospitals. Many of us veterans have private health insurance via our employers. The GS employees have good health insurance as well.
That's the problem with federal agencies they all think they don't have rules to follow. But we have to follow their rules.
The crisis wasn't coming.  It was here.  It had been.  The VA has been a disaster for decades.  No President can fix it.  It's going to take an infusion of funds to re-build the infrastructure to accomodate the flow of our Veterans who are not only just now coming back, but those who have fought for our country in the numerous wars and police actions that have been going on almost endlessly since the end of WWII.  As a nation, we have turned our backs on our brave men and women, and now political parties are once again using them to get elected.
People are either simple-minded or have short memories. If they did their own investigating, they would discover that the VA's systemic issues have been happening for decades. The other problem is, they can't fire Federal employees without completing a formal investigation and submitting the report under union rules.
Go suk a diq Art.
If you give me your address, I'll send you an invitation to the present!
What about uner Bush?  Remember Walter Reed?
The man is dead. Let it go.
Reagan was a POS! I can see why he was a Hero to the Repubs!
Yadont say
So bad
Clinton had problems with the VA also.
The VA was horrible under Reagan.
Actually, the VA has been a nightmare for decades.  It's not a new problem.  And it gets lots of run towards the election cycle.  And that's what the politicians are doing now.  Making hay out of this so they can get elected, then they will ignore it too.
No way!
How do you "research" how ALL vets feel? Do you have the phone numbers for all veterans who actually are authorized use of VA facilities?

The majority of vets do not even USE the VA for health care.  A veteran is anyone who served in the military.  Just by virtue of service alone does not get your health care in the VA system (many people do not know that).  A veteran has to have a service connected condition rated high enough to be seen at a facility. Or they must have an over all high enough disability rating to have all of their health care taken care of at the VA.  Example. A veteran served from '93-97 and was awarded 10% disability for their knee. All they are going to be seen at the VA for is their knee unless they get a higher rating for something else. It is not like everyone who gets out of the military has the option of just going down to the VA whenever they want. Some people really think that is how it is.

The care isn't what you think. Try getting a same day appointment like most civilians can. Or even the same WEEK or month. Some VA clinics might be able to, but most can't. They will tell you to go to an ER. Nice, huh? That really bites when you have a sore throat or worse. I think we all know what an ER nurse will tell you if you go there with a sore throat (after your 12 hour wait that it).
The government likes to let people think they are on top of mental health care too, right? HAHA Where I am people are given an option to SKYPE with a counselor in another city for mental health care because they are so short staffed on people. Really! Who in their right mind would get on a camera and spill their guts on the internet, knowing that the government is storing every frame of video? No thanks. Oh, this is in a community very close to a MAJOR military installation with thousands of combat vets. Nice huh?
The VA had the most problems under Nixon. Well could be a close tie with Carter.
Vote Libertarian
Actually, I have had excellent service. Delays are there, but at least at the facility I use, they are probably not that far off from private specialists.
To do what
The irony is that Lincoln, today, would be a Democrat.  Look at his policies.  They were primarily liberal policies, such as emancipation, forgiveness of the South's debts, etc.  But hey, who's paying attention to such things?
What choice is there? They want you in the VA system cuz you served'. Sometimes I wonder if that benefit is a curse? at least in Miami. Boston and San Diego were good.
I don't think Dubya had entire media networks in his back pocket protecting him like this guy does. Doubt that?
Does the Government pay for Police and Firefighters health care ?
Please.  Explain how he has "lead from behind".  I find that comment insanely interesting.
Buchanan was much better
Short of getting the best service and free healthcare...everyone will complain to some degree.
Don Lemon I will go on your show.
I can't remember a time when the VA hasn't been messing with the vets.
Greg
Just like George Washington.  Well, except for the whole slave thing.
The VETS need to say their are illegal aliens and every politicians would be there for them.. to make sure they got everything they want.. these poor guys are just American vets.. big deal..
Carter took hostages in Iran?  Carter was in charge of OPEC?  Ah, so it is okay to blame Carter because Reagan inherited the Carter economy, but that doesn't hold true in blaming Bush for the economy the current administration inherited?  And no, interest rates were not right up there with Reagan if you go back and check the data.
Typo, You mean the Dems
What's your point? Since it's been this way we should just leave it be? Slavery was around for decades in the US yet all it took was a book to open the average American's eyes to how cruel and inappropriate it was.
Republicans claimed that they blocked the bill because Majority Leader Harry Reid would not allow an up or down vote on an amendment that would have attached sanctions on Iran to the bill.
"Hey, I know the back room is caving in...and I know you have all kinds of higher priority problems I'm leaving you with like stopping a Depression and two wars to fight, and high unemployment among the plethora of other things needing fixing around this place - but HERE, it's a detailed report on the stuff we found but didn't do anything about.  I gotta get outta here, so hey, when you finally stop the rest of the house from falling in, you got all the info you need about the back room to get it fixed - we had it for eight years but it's your baby now"!
We treat illegal aliens better then our vets.. even when are vets went to DC to protest they were blocked but illegals were allowed and even had the Dem leaders in congress show up to speak for them.. amazing how backwards this country and politicians are today..
It's Bush fault.
Because they know.
No, that was the Bush administration.
Okay? What's your point? We should all put our heads back in the sand?
Since 1930.  Check it out.  
No we don't!!!
lolwhut?  "Netsex"?  LOL4EVER
You got it mister. I am not yours I never was we had a netsex relationship that was it and your married so leave me alone.
Can you imagine the comments had the military requested their use and the President prohibited it? If they save an American soldier's life, I'm all for it. And I'm wondering if there is an accurate count of the innocents killed by conventional warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Yes we DO like our healthcare. Yeah there ARE problems, but over all, we get better care than MOST of the civilian population.
You don't get to decide who can and cannot respons to you on a public forum.

Your only choice is to not post.
I WAS in it.
Just another day of incomptence from the most inept Administration since James Buchanan's.
My father (a vet) didn't live close to a VA hospital (thankfully in hindsight) and got his healthcare from "normal" hospitals.  The coverage he had through CHAMPUS was quite comprehensive.  Vets aren't forced to use VA hospitals, right?
DO IIIITTTTTT
Michelle Obama needs an ass-reduction surgery, stat.
..the bunny?
If you reply to me one more time I am going to sue that's a promise. You need to leave me alone.
Don't forget blaming Bush and free stuff.
.
You mean, "UUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH" let me be clear.
Sure, just make sure you ask the ones who the VA didn't kill.
This has been going on for years with the VA its nothing new.
And the ones who don't like it can't say so, because they're dead!!
Astounding logic!  LOL!  Bush knew enough about the VA problem to have it investigated, verified, written about, and reported - but...you don't think he should share ANY of the blame for its condition?  He's 'innocent' of not attempting to do anything..since, after all, he handed the problem off to the next guy?  Seriously??
I am not a vet. My grandfather is, as is my boyfriend. I have seen the way they are treated at the VA here. My boyfriend started having numbness and tightness in the chest and called and tried to get in and despite his symptoms they said it would be at least four weeks before they could see him. A few days later I didn't give him an option and took him to the ER at the hospital closest to us. He was in hypertension stage 2. I am happy it didn't get worse than that but I think about how bad it could have been if he had waited any longer. Unacceptable. He has been dragging his feet with getting help with his PTSD because he knows it will be a nightmare in itself just to get that process going. I won't even take my grandfather there. People can argue with me if they like, but from someone who sees it everyday at home, it breaks my heart the way you guys are treated, or should I say lack of being treated.
Don't worry, he will say some useless words, most likely lies, preceded by "Let me be clear"
But Obama may it his project when he took office. Gave a big speech about it and everything.
You guys exemplify exactly what is wrong with our country.  You are stupid enough to think that one party is "good" and the other is "bad".  That's exactly how they want you to think.  The truth is they both suck horribly.  Both Bush and Obama could have fixed the VA but didn't.  
Word of advice - hold your own chosen political party to the same level of accountability as you do to the party you oppose.
I blame Greg
Ya because that is a new thing right? Because Dubya supporters didn't ever try and push blame back on Clinton.  Nothing like the indignation of a hypocrit.
Yes we do...and we do deal with it...
Republicans turned their backs to our vets.
nutjob alert
Majority of vets HATE their healthcare. Just go do the research
first off Brandon - I'm 49.  I may be a kid to you though.  My Uncles didn't rave about anything about Vietnam.  My Uncle Jim flew out the injured in his Huey and to this day BARELY has spoken a word about his time there.  He's getting up there in age and is getting decent care at the VA.  But he won't talk about what took place over there.  My other 2 Uncles (one on my moms side and the other on my fathers) didn't see as much combat but still are up there in age and are getting great care at the VA. And btw my grandfather also received the purple heart in WW1 as he was shot, and is proudly displayed in my parents home.  I don't make up crap to prove a point, its fact.  I don't really care how miserable you are, and I'm not your son so don't call me that.  Just because you had a horrible experience doesn't mean everyone does so get over it.
He's going to get to the bottom of this
Hey Andre,Why do you twist words,Is it to justify your actions & words.Yes I am a fellow Veteran 1977-1984 US Army.
Bush cut taxes on the wealthiest saying it would stimulate the economy. It didn't and noone with a basic understanding of economics really thought it would.   Then he borrowed huge amounts of money to cover the holes in the tax revenue and started 2 wars that he didn't have the money to pay for. He has his staff go on national TV and directly lie to the citizens about the need to invade Iraq.   
Nearly 4,000 dead US Soldiers in Iraq and according to The US Military at least 70,000 innocent civilians so that 2 guys who did everything they could to make sure they and their children never had to go anywhere near combat could show the world how manly they are.
Because you shouldn't be spamming.
He wont stand for it
Current use of drones is super annoying. However it is still the future of warfare regardless. Future administrations regardless of political ideology are most likely going to still misuse them in some way.
And Mr. Harry Reid does not allow votes.
So you don't care about the vets that suffered the VA's incompetence 10 years ago? 20 years ago? 70 years ago?


Only those dying under Obama's watch? How nice.
Oh how they love to try to forget their worst President ever!  So, why do you evoke President Reagan whenever you want to lament the past - and just skip over Bush?!  Kinda speaks volumes, since it lessens your nonsensical argument about Obama!  Again, trying to rewrite history by denying Bush ever existed!  Jeez!!!
And yet Obama and his useless administration has made things much worse by leading from behind. Making this a partisan issue is simply foolish!
Yet you voted for Bush TWICE and the same problem existed then. Sit down hypocrite. At least Obama will leave the nation better off than when he found it, unlike Bush who left it a smoldering pile of ruins.
Like everything else, blocked by "the no compromise, un-American, Tea Party GOP"-TIME.
And dp1973, you do realize who has pulled the purse strings for those 5 years right?  Obama can only do so much without adequate funding.
Close the VA and let them get Obama care.....
Spoken like someone who is not on that program, and hasn't used ANY Vet healthcare!  I am related so someone on it, and she chooses to use medicare/private insurance!  You do the research Mac, and please post it for us.  The rest of us have jobs.
It's not all Obama's fault but he is the current president and has the power to change things. All past presidents have no such power. It is not a partisan issue as both parties are equally incompetent as is the waste of space in the WH.
Wait....wait....Shinsucki's got this.....
sorry, "Anything of importance or worth"
The lack of reason and logic in this country never ceases to amaze me". - "That's exactly what I think of those that voted for the current president TWICE".  

That's exactly what I think of those who voted for this current Do-Nothing Congress...some of them who will do again in Nov. 2014 - TWICE!
And the first thing the right wants to do is play politics. Perfect example of how they continue to hold this country back. Lots of whining, crying and finger pointing, lots of disinformation, lots of lies and not a single solution offered by a single republican. Not one. That too is an embarrassment, they are just to ignorant to realize it.
You saw the other option in both those charades didn't you?
Funny :) Exactly what I said 7 years ago!
He's obstructing...that takes effort....
Many people don't have money for insurance.  What world do you live in?  
These men served our country and are entitled to utilize this system as Veterans.  They should not have to provide themselves with private insurance.  They risked their lives for the country for a minimum of 2 years if drafted and 4 years if they volunteered to serve.  Why should they have to reach into their own pocket when they are supposed to be covered by the VA?
Yes because those vets didn't start having any issues with the VA up until he became President. I mean we all know anything bad that's happening in America only started happening in 2009.
yeah, because there were no issues whatsoever with the VA before then, right?
VA physicians make twice that of a private doctor!
Go ( beep) yourself.

The VA said you had too much income?
I guess you will have to ask those vets that died due to lack or no VA healthcare and ask them.
Agreed but Obama stated when he took office he was going to "change" things at the VA. I did not know he meant for the worse.
1700 vets that can't even get on the fairy waiting list and many who have died isn't "aren't happy," it's as inexcusable as your post claiming some great doctors who do a wonderful job excuse a system that has caused others to die. What is your agenda, really?
What was so bad about Carter?  Hostages in Iran, gas lines, interest rates right up there with Reagan (after all, Reagan inherited the Carter economy), etc.
WHAT?! My friend needs heart treatments...pacemaker, and more studies...6 months before he will see the specialist. I don't think he appreciated that.
Most of my vet buddies who I served and still serve with, find the VA dreadfully incompetent and inefficient.
I am glad someone else realizes that Bush and Obama are equally awful. I wish more would.
It's not a funding issue. VA funding has doubled since 2009 and they've carried over hundreds of millions of dollars in unspent money every year - $500 million from fiscal years 2012 to 2013.
I don't believe that he should be the Scpae Goat for years and years and years of poor service from the V.A.


I would rather that someone that now knows what is Screwed, be given a chance to makes changes,


Otherwise it is just starting over, and an opportunity to sweep in all under the rug.
u 12?
If your income is not poverty level you're denied care. I know. I'm honorably discharged received care in the early 80's  went back few month ago for heart and cancer and they said I now had too much income. That shouldn't matter if your an honorable vet.
Obama spits on their graves.
Do you understand why?
Greg Johnson I am warning you for a final time leave me alone.
Obama hates Veterans
Agreed
yea....time to go Shinseki....it's okay...knowing when to say "when" is important....

McCain...time to go also....

Note:  Military/VA health care has always sucked.
Obama hates America.
I am just telling you what the truth is. Once the vets get into the system the majority of them like it.
This doesn't have anything to do with Bush's war vets!  This has to do with the 50-80 year old vets that are dying under OBAMA's watch because of blatent abuse and fraud!
Oh, I read your bio. Tells me that you believe in several things.  Doesn't make the true intent of my reply any less true.  Also just how are your guns going to protect your freedom of speech?
Don well I will go on your show this needs to stop.
Don't get it twisted, they never said that.  They said no change to the current VA healthcare systems funding.

Besides, if the hospitals had been doing their jobs from the beginning and showing how long actual wait times are, I think everyone would agree on spending what it takes to take care of our Vets.

And don't forget, Democrats voted to get us in these wars too...Kerry, Dodd and Clinton (along with many others) all supported going into Iraq & Afghanistan.
The bank bailouts were paid back with interest. Do you disagree with that?
GOP voted against funding NO MONEY they said that was in MARCH how we forget.....
Johnsons
Another Obama failure.
CNN will not let me copy and past in a post.
Yes, I mean the one that was signed into law originally on October 26, 2001.
The VA has always suffered from too few doctors and underpaid physicians...
what is this
Just wait, he'll take credit for the next guy's successes too.
Because it was part of the benefit package they were promised when they signed up.
No we don't.
Other than the 40 that died waiting and all the others on the secret wait list. Yeah i'm sure the majority are so happy with things. Get a clue and stop repeating political talking points.
GOP voted against it......NO MONEY they said .....but they can always find it for wars
Nor does it make any sense.  The VA has been an issue for decades and through multiple presidents.
Why does it need more funding? They cant even manage it with what they have
Have you had to deal with the VA? Are you a vet waiting on a list?
read bio genius. Romney was to let it up to each state.
And you are very astute. I wish I was as smart as you. I can only dream to someday be on the same level to hold a conversation with someone who has even an inkling of the brain power that you do.
"There have been many chances for the republicans to fix it"



And... there have been many chances for the democrats to do it, too.


At some point you will realize they are basically the same group. Slightly different demographics in their target markets, slightly different words said, same end results of their actions.
Obama doesn't control the field level decision making, or the strength and movements of the other side.  There is no correlation between the POTUS and the rate of death on a day to day basis in a war that has been running for 10 years.   If the rate of death had gone done and people were lauding Obama's military leadership I'm sure this is what you'd be saying to me.
Whiskey, Seems as if you have been drinking to much of that stuff.  Where do you think the idea for the ACA originated?  The Heritage Foundation originally suggested this plan which happened to have been implemented in Mass. under Romney.
You trolls really give a crap about the vets don't ya?
Its funny under Bush no one said a word ,,it was OK to have our kids go to a war but vote down money to take care of them...THAT IS WHAT THE GOP DID not Obama...IDIOT......
Are you sure?
Nah, we don't.  The problems have been around for much longer.  I know that, and you need to do some research so that you become aware of it as well.
Yes he does speak for all vets!  No vet gets the adequate health care they need unless they are retired from the military and can use TRICARE.  A combat wounded or service connected disability vet doesn't stand a chance!
Why are Republicans ok with referring to Reagan, Lincoln, Washington, Jefferson, Eisenhower and even Clinton but not Bush?
Can you translate what exactly it is you are trying to say. Thank you
Yet you and your left wing pals held George W Bush accountable for everything from 9/11 to the housing bubble bursting, didn't you?
Senate Republicans blocked the veterans bill by using a procedural maneuver to invoke the 60 vote rule. The final vote to waive the budget point of order failed, 56-41.
TROLL
Obamacare is designed to kill undesirable Americans.  Obama is president now, but later who will orchestrate the deaths.  Ha Ha Ha Ha.  First one side murders the other, then the other side; meanwhile, vacancies are being created for good immigrants to replace the population.  God is destroying the heathen America from many degrees
Go to hell CNN with your blocking my posts its from another site about McCain.
Yeah the children out  there don't know anything about mortgages being 20% under Reagan (I had one at 17.5% and thought I hit the lottery)! Or the negative equity situations and 15% unemployment rates and failing banks of GB1  in the early 90's
And, of course, Carter, Clinton, and Obama (all Democrats) fixed it right up, didn't they? Oh, wait...
What is your point? I know quite a few who haven't had one complaint. Maybe you know other who have complaints. As you will see from these comments there are some vets who like and others who don't. I think it depends on your region.
Nope, just wondering why you care
First off the ACA is health INSURANCE not health CARE. Second, the ACA is not even government run health insurance. You still have the same insurance companies as before. Now they must abide by the guidelines of the ACA. The real joke is someone who tries to apply logic in places it doesnt fit with false information.
Ignorant democrappies no doubt. Evidently some are too stupid to know Shinseki was an obama appointee so they still blame Bush.
Come on CNN let this through it has to do with this.
Check again. Bush 43 signed off on a bill that limits secret service protection to 10 years after the end of their term only. Lifetime protection was ended with Clinton.
that doesn't rhyme
The problems at the VA are nothing new, and to claim ignorance of them is, well, ignorant.  If needs are that dire, there are alternatives.  Use them.
Demonrats control the Senate!  12 VA bills sent there from the House sitting on Dirty Harry Reid's desk. He's refused to put them to vote!!!!  Try some facts!
Your initials, do they stand for what you are FULL of??  Royal Bulls**t???
Carter was a successful Southern business man and he didn't own one slave?
I don't care where he was born. He's not fit to be the leader of the U.S.
Name calling lowlife trailer trash.
And you are ignoring the Thousands of fellow service members who can't even get care or have died in the name you got what you should why? Are you really a fellow veteran?
It's not a funding issue. The VA carried over more than $500 million from fiscal years 2012 to 2013.
Hardly. The three benchmarks for bad presidencies have been and still shall be: Nixon, Harding, and Buchanan. Sorry, it's too soon to judge Bush 43 with the level-headedness of history and my feeling is Bush is a middle of the road president, just as I feel Obama is a middle of the road president.
I have went to private healthcare since the early 90's. I prefer it. I personally don't want to drive 3 hours one way and have to wait a month to be seen.. There is no need of that.
Contact me about our liking of VA health care...I'LL TELL YA SOME PERSONAL HORROR STORIES..
Are you going to completely ignore his point about the rate of death?!
Trish - there were riots when WW1 Vets were not getting war pay from the Government. There are so many examples of our government dumping on our veterans post war its ridiculous. Feel free to point out its all Obama's fault if that makes you feel better and you want to ignore the continued mistreatment of our vets by the both sides of the government over our nations history. Remember though, if you want to whine about it being Obama's fault, plenty of people will respond by asking why exactly did we go to war with Iraq to create all these needy vets in the first place.
Making this a partisan issue is exactly what both sides want.
Are you CNN?
My father is a vet and gets FIRST CLASS care that is far beyond what my employer insurance or ACA will provide.  The problem is certain locations are being swamped and rather than address the issue, the culture is apparently to hide the issues rather than fix it.
ACA is not designed to replace the VA healthcare network.  
Don;t insult vets by saying "no one is going to hand it to them". They earned VA benefits.  Perhaps if someone TOLD them the VA benefits would not be honored the VETS could do something different.
Instead of ACA, Obama should have kept his promise to the Vets he made as a candidate.  Instead he did nothing to address the issues HE knew were coming.
So?
Pretty sure the VA exists no matter what political party has the Presidency.
CNN other news sites across the globe police their blogs.
Ridiculous.
You are just dead wrong.
I'm not sure why you are nitpicking with your point.....that somebody said ALL vets don't like their healthcare.  If you were able to READ, check the article.  ANY vets dying because their health was neglected due to the inefficiencies at this GOVERNMENT RUN SYSTEM is UNACCEPTABLE.  It is a prelude to what YOUR president wants for the ENTIRETY of our populous....with his joke of a bureaucracy, Nobamacare.
There shouldn't be any serviceman in Afghanistan in the first place.  I remember how surprised we all were that Russia was so willing to help the US get in there logistically, but now realize Putin and the boys must have been peeing themselves laughing at how moronic the Bush administration was to go in there with full knowledge of what happened to the Russians in the 80s.  Clowns.
The VA hospital system was regarded as a bad joke when I got out of the army in 1971. There have been many chances for the republicans to fix it, but they would rather work for the very rich and let the rest of us go to hell. Time to get rid of the GOP/Tea Bag/Libertarians.
mac4242, you're clearly not a veteran lol
Bush 43's administration knew of issue with the VA as early as 2005, yet chose to do nothing for his last term. Why are you surprised that another administration has also sat idly by?
CNN must we have the childish idiotic name calling in here from these nutso's.
Sorry, as a veteran, I will never forgive Bush/Chaney for the deaths of 4,500 or more American soldiers...
No, but he block funding to make it better.
Here is why: U.S. Senate Republicans blocked legislation on Thursday that would have expanded federal healthcare and education programs for veterans, saying the $24 billion bill would bust the budget.
Funny how there is an article showing that the VA will have surplus money for medical treatment, for a 5th straight year!


So if your only excuse is that the system has had a major influx over the last few years, then it is a poor one at best.  Bush doubled the VA spending from 2003 to 2008 and Obama doubled it again from 2008 to 2014.  So obviously the money is there. That tells me that it is the management, or lack there of, that is at fault.  So tell me, who is responsible for the management of the VA?  And who was responsible for putting that individual in the position of being in charge of the VA?


It has been 5 years.  There is ample money and many vets, and civilians, that need jobs.  So what is the excuse again?
They might well qualify for ACA but they (I as well) served our country and EARNED the right to get care at the VA.   There shouldn't be a waiting list.   If you produce a DD214 with an Honorable discharge you should be in the system soonest.
Obama lied, veterans died. I read it in the news.
Yes we do .I have gone to private health care sometimes and it sucks
Can you please cite your source? Thank you.
Exactly!
So I guess the current administration gets a free pass on all mistakes. Wow, what a concept...screw up anything...blame the guy before you. His 8 years will be a joke...and he can always say...blame the guy before me..its his fault. My tax money goes to lifetime protection for someone that doesn't have to do anything or be held accountable for anything. Sounds fair
Funny, that is exactly what I say to liberals,  Soviet Union, Rome...
In a way he does he is a member of Congress. Look who is doing the name calling?
Obama is totally and utterly outraged, let me be clear. Period.
No, I mean that Obama is a poor leader, knows nothing about foreign policy and is incapable of leading the military.  That's why under Obama servicemen are killed at a rate 4 times that as under Bush.
For a country that was founded at the height of the Age of Enlightenment, it is sad to see us descending into another Dark Age where dogma trumps fact.
Veterans died and Obama lied. Again.
I think Obama is just as bad as Bush was, I think back to back (16 years) of ineptitude is going to bring this nation to it's knees.
Well "Us" could certainly poop out 20million of the others if this administration would follow our immigration laws.
Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it.

...because they don't understand either what happened or what caused things to happen.  

Deliberate ignorance serves nobody's purpose except those trying to exploit you for their own gain.
Another.....Dumb....Libtard.....
you mean the GOP morons?
Does he run it? What position does he hold in the VA, m0r0n?
Shut up monkey.
Why because he is a vet??  Please make sense
As much as you have bud.
You mean the patriot act Obama extended in 2010 and resigned for 4 years in 2011
dumbya's wars started this whole debacle with the va...you and i both know that..
So where do YOU say Obama was born?
This is where Medicaid has lead.  Medicare is heading this way as will Obamacare.
You do realize that a lot of the issues that vets are dealing with now are a result of Bush's actions.  Bush needs to be held responsible.
Are pathetic supplicants like you still under the impression you have any political power?
The alternative would not have taken our choice for health insurance away.
Dubya's staff wrote up a report about these issues for the INCOMING OBAMA staff.  Obviously they chose to not read the report and dump it in the trash.  WHY NOW is all of this hoopla coming up in the press?  Where was Obama on this for the time he's been in WH?  IRS advises all of us, just because you don't know about a tax doesn't mean you don't owe it and oh by the way if you are late you owe a late fee plus penalties.  Obama can't claim ignorance about this situation and get away with it.  If his staff chose to not read Dubya's staff report about the VA serious issues, that does NOT exclude them from being responsible for not having the situation recitifed.  NOW? they want to do some kind of research into the problem?
Too late, should have read the report.  Now just sent the Vets that can't be helped right away to private hospitals.
Problems with the VA is nothing new, there have been problems since its first day. It doesn't make it right but just showing it's not Obama's fault.
You made a rhyme this time.
Everybody knows whose wars they are.   Blaming them on Obama just takes you out of the rational discussion.
Hahahahahaha, tyats sown funny stuff there.
Layoff the wacky tabacky.
We will be paying for Georgie's multi trillion dallor debt he left from unfounded wars he started.
You must be dumbest liberal on earth
Maybe but he doesn't run it...
Yes, they have a choice. Eat and not being treated. Or not eat and being treated. It is a choice.  Going into war and dying for us isn't free enterprise for maximum profit. I'm for capitalism with minimal government intervention.
And are ignorant folks like you still referring to the President as the Messiah?
Obama lied and veterans died
According to a liberal the VA is fine.  Further, 75% of all casualties occurred during the Obama presidency.  Also VA funding is twice that today than 2005.
Research has led to the conclusion your pseudonym post is the stupidest since the Gulf War. Are you a veteran? (I am). You feel it necessary to post such an unfounded statement when at least 1700 patients couldn't even get an appointment why? The "just go do the research" statement after an ignorant claim doesn't work here. I imagine a few veterans have had good "luck" at the VA but you just don't get it do you? There is no percentage of Veterans that survive at the hands of committed doctors like the one who blew the whistle in the first place that can justify the abhorrent policy those responsible shouldn't just be TERMINATED, never mind resign, but face criminal prosecution for the role they are playing in knowingly causing not just a denial of care but the logical conclusion of that - their death.
Your right Mac,I do like my VA health care In Henderson Nevada.
Is this where Medicare has lead?  How come the Republicans are screaming "hands off my Medicare"?
McCain is partly responsible for the way the VA operates.
You mean the war Bush got the US into, and the war Obama wanted to get out of with the GOP blocking his every move accusing him of being weak?  Right - got it.
And your research paper and survey results are published where exactly?
I am well aware of the Patriot act, and Obama's continuation, indefinite extension, expansion and support for such.

So the fact that he took a chainsaw to a knife wound means nothing?

The fact that he expanded a drone campaign that has so far killed over 3000 innocents and counting means nothing?

The fact that he appointed a Comcast lobbyist and campaign donor to the FCC chair to end internet freedom of speech means nothing?

Are we still riding the Messiah train?
I agree with you - just commenting on the ones jumping on Obama.  This has been going on for YEARS, way before Obama and it's not at every VA.  You see through this comment section numerous VA's saying in what cities they get decent care, but of course I'm sure some don't agree.  This VA in Phoenix had this covered up to a high level and I hope people get fired with no golden chute.
If he's a vet and you aren't then your argument is invalid
VA funding has doubled since 2009
You are not very astute, and that IS a fact.
Why McCain is complaining about this when he ignored complaints of women being raped in the military is beyond me?
VA funding has doubled since 2005. Enough already.  The VA is a failure no matter how much funding.
Consider the alternative.
Yes, it's called Medicare
Obama spent all the time pandering to gays, maybe he should look whats going on in his administration
Yes, the majority do.
It's not a funding issue. The VA carried over more than $500 million from fiscal years 2012 to 2013. Try again partisan hack!
as Obama continues HIS war in Afghanistan!
Google is your friend learn how to use it.
Obama seems to be the most disconnected president ever.  "I saw it on the news, just like you folks did" .. Or whatever he said.  In this age of technology and communications... I just can't believe that. And I can't believe anything that comes out of his mouth.
Can you back that up with some statistics from a reliable source?
The VA is actually just fine - the problem is there are too many people in need of service, and the republicans refuse to fund it adequately.
Cause you said so right?
Wow, just go look it up.
As opposed to the Reagan years when interest rates approached 20%.  What was so bad about Carter?
75% of all Afghanistan casualties occurred during the Obama presidency.
That is because they have had an influx of new vets. Like I said go do your research.
When you say give, do you mean me pay for someone else's and my own? Veterans should receive (not be given) the very best care because they earned it. Everyone should not be given health care unless they are doing something productive. There is no such thing as free health care. I know because my employer is paying more for mine and I am paying more for my families through them because of the tax they are paying for the affordable care act.
Gays and weed smokers have done real well under Obama. The rest, well they got shafted
When the raping of the constitution called "The Patriot Act" ceases to exist.
...or just punch a liberal.
Why?
Punch a conservative and thank them for all the Vets that need the VA.
Single payer system liberals? Buwahahahaha
Now you just need to study History!
Who told you that you have to take your employers insurance?  I am retired navy and use my military insurance only.  I do not have my employers insurance.
The liberal model for socialized, government run, health care is the VA.  It's a failure.  This is where Obamacare will lead.
Ok so please tell me, when does the "Bush Effect" wear off? When do all of Obama's failures become his responsibility?

How many centuries will we blame other presidents for the way Obama raped the constitution?
Punch a liberal and thank them for the VA scandal
What is your point?
wow, don't let your total brain dead talking points get in the way of your ignorance.
Resign Obama
If that were the case, America wouldn't have to waste its tax dollars on the Senate or Congress,now would it?.  And I bet if it were left to the President alone as you suggest then it would probably pass.
This issue is about government run, single payer, health care.  It's what Obamacare will very likely become when it fails as it was designed to do.  Watch out America this could be you!
I had the misfortune of living through the Carter years and I admit,  after campaigning and voting for him. After it was over I honestly thought America had learned a lesson and never could possibly make such a mistake again. I was wrong. I would be wrong once again if I were to assume that we as a country have paid the price for electing Obama  and have learned  a lesson. Sadly I believe the country as a whole is still dumb enough to elect another as equally or far worse as incompentant as Obama.
Shows you whats in store for Obamacare
lol really fixed and you mean forced to sign up.
Move on Shinseki !
If they enacted policies that are still having a lasting, negative effect on the country, absolutely yes.
Thank you for all you done for us. Its a shame that you;re still sacrificing. No matter if it costs you one cent or a thousand dollars.  It is a sacrifice.
Ok well tell that to the vets who like it. I am just passing on the facts.
Not an Obama failure, it's an OPM failure. They can't seem to attach hiring bonuses to these job recruitments to get the right (quality) people to apply to the job announcements.
Obama needs to go as well.
You lie
And yet, those Vets may well qualify for ACA and could seek care anywhere. It requires effort though. No one is going to hand it to them.
Fixed it?  For a billion dollars?  I certainly hope so.
Not hardly.
Yea, they cant even get healthcare now. No need to toss more money out the window
Just stop your kneejerk BS talking about Bush. I'm not a Republican and I hate you worthless snivelling liberals.

Should we also blame Andrew Jackson and Ulysses S. Grant while we're at it?
U.S. Senate Republicans blocked legislation on Thursday that would have expanded federal healthcare and education programs for veterans, saying the $24 billion bill would bust the budget.
I guess he touched you also!
a leftist nonsequitir
you realize this problem with the VA is not from  a practice that just started, right? it's not like potus was conspiring
Obama failure..anything this man touches goes to shiite
Those eight million people probably think so.  I suspect the insurance companies are grateful, too.
Majority of vets say they like their health care until THEY GET SICK
Local VA here is often dirty, takes weeks to get an appt. and the customer service is horrific.
But I'm sure some aren't totally incompetent.
Maybe one.
Don't need research, I am a vet and have dealt with VA.
Have you?
They have more money than they can spend!  This is an incompetence issue and it starts at the very top!
Yea brilliant work.
can I ask the ones who died while waiting?
They're already gone, darling.  TMYK
The United States, making Haliburton billions, and giving the shaft to our soldiers. Just unconscionable.
Funding isn't an issue in this case, genius.
Kennedy and Johnson you mean?
Why don't they have the money and why don't they have private insurance which would allow them to seek treatment anywhere?
It's not a funding issue. The VA carried over more than $500 million from fiscal years 2012 to 2013.
Uh, fixed it promptly and got eight million people to sign up for insurance?
You lie. The VA got their money.
Lack of reason and logic isn't confined to any country. It's pandemic.
Ok.
Speaking for yourself is going in the face of literally every veteran I have ever known or even talked to about their experiences.

But thanks for your input.
I KNOW!!!! The GOP voted NO to more funding for the VA! 

Outrageous!!!!!!
Obama and his minions cant manage ANYTHING. Look what they did on a 1 Billion dollar web page!
As opposed to the previous one who created most of the injured veterans...
Outrageous!!!!!!
This administration needs to go, all of them
Stupid response.  Obama campaigned on improving Vets care and the Bush Admin. warned Obama that there was a crisis coming.  To be this "lost" after 5-6 years in office is ridiculous.  Obama wanted "obamacare" and the heck with "Vetcare".  
There were problems and it was NO surprise to candidate Obama.
Another Obama failure
Obama is in charge, ok? Not congress.
Ahhhh its a lot harder to manage than to make up new policies...
The same thoughts I have about the folks that put GW in office twice.  Actually, they voted for him twice but put him in office once.
You lie. The VA carried over 500 Million in left over money from 2013...so funding is not an issue. Mismanagement  is
An isolated event?  Lol... I doubt you have 3 uncles who just sit and rave about their VA healthcare to their nephew.  You sound like a kid trying to be a kid.  I am medically retired, and I dislike and pay out of pocket instead of going to the va.  It is a horrible experience.  This isn't a right wing issue, it's a veterans issue, political beliefs play no part in this son.
No, we don't.  It varies from clinic to clinic.
What a stupid thing to say! the bail out began at the end of  Bush's term and was implemented and supplemented under Obama!  
So tell me how Bush paid anyone back if he wasn't in office when the bills came due? For your info Congress controls the purse strings not the president!!!
Dumb lying liberal
The VA's budget has increased 40 Billion in the last 4 years. Your political hack narrative is a lie. None, I repeat none were were voted against.
Lesser of two evils for a lot of people. Romney wouldn't have been much better.
It's time we just give all US citizens healthcare.
That makes no sense, you're choosing to pay, you do not have to pay after doing 20 years active.  I pay out of pocket as well, but it's by choice.  I'm medically retired USN.
Hmmm... I would ask them, but it would seem quite a few of them died waiting for treatment.
Well said 
And Veterans have been making jokes and complaining about the system for years.  The majority do not like the system but it is the care that is given to them as part of their benefit package so they deal with it.  What choice do they have, spend money they don't have for private care?
I like my healthcare don't speak for me!!!
Well he spoke for me too, so WE can be used.
Trying unsuccessfully to fix the mess the previous guy left behind.
I want to put all politicians on the Phoenix waiting list.
Its NO single Presidents fault, this has been going on for decades and its an embarrassment.
And the guy before him twice.
I'm not jumping on Obama.  I'm jumping on the budget cuts that have been made to VA and Military healthcare.  If your uncles, like the care that they are getting from a VA hospital, they are lucky.    Obama gets blamed because he's in charge.  He is the Commander In Chief.  He needs to ask the questions to his Secretary or Czar and then make the appropriate firings.  No matter what, he is responsible.  Harry Truman said it best with a sign on his desk, "The buck stops here".  Get over your petty political nonsense and face the facts.  Both sides of the isle are pretty worthless.
I chose to serve my country.  I chose to spend 32 years in every hot spot in the world.  I did not choose to lose my arm or half my jaw.  I did not choose to suffer from phantom limb syndrome.  I did not choose to be exposed to agent orange.  I did not choose to wait nearly 3 years for a prosthetic that fit properly.  Yeah I had a choice.  What was yours?
Oh I did for a while until my premium went up out of the range of affordability.
I never had a choice since the day I was discharged. Private health insurance wouldn't touch me cause of all of the pre-existing and that was back in 1981.
I want a new item on the next election ballot:

Trade Politicians' medical care with that of the Vets' / Soldiers'
I like mine because it picks up the co-pays left over from my other insurance.  I guess I should just forget that I was promised free medical care for the rest of my life if I stayed 20 years.
<i>"If you like your Veteran's healthcare, you can keep your Veteran's health care."</i>  otherwise known as 'ObamaDON'Tcare.'


Thank you CNN and whistleblowers for exposing this disgusting operation.  Now quick.......go to Russia before the government gets you.
Your right the Dems hate the VETS so much that they tried to pass VET law to help them but hmm i think that also got blocked by the PARTY OF NO..but hey when the Republican take control of the White House again they will make sure they will send our family back out to make up for the money they lost on not going to wars..
I'm a navy vet who gets VA benefits free for life because of injuries sustained during service, I'm now medically retired.  I pay out of pocket because I did not like the way I was treated at the Sacramento VA.  I will not wait for over a month to be seen by a doctor, I like to be able to call my doctor, get through to them the same day, be seen that day if need be.  If I subjected myself to going to the VA I would never be treated like a patient, I'm treated as a number.  I won't even go into specifics for the sake of it being just a cnn message board, but it was not good.
All the funds Bush used to bail out the banks was paid back with interest. He saved the economy and obama used the stimulus to payback his donors (unions, etc...).
How, with what insurance and why should it be paid for by anyone but the US Govt?
Right... and you do.
You need to do some real research.  Your comment is void of truth.
I do.  I pay $5000 a year because I'm forced to take my employer's insurance before I can use my military benefits.  So much for giving 20 years of my life to a country that breaks it's promises right and left because politicians can't control their spending habits
If you like your PTSD, you can keep it.
Bush and his cronies were so inept and damaged the country so much that in 100 years people will still be using him as a yardstick for 'bad'
Who the hell have you been talking to?
The Democrats prefer to keep in place a tax loophole used by illegal aliens than to provide adequate funding for our vets.
The only people Democrats hate worse than veterans are active duty members of our military.
The healthy ones that don't use it :-)
Oh I know that! With money anything is possible but that is not the point. The point is that the VA system does very little in the way a managing costs for soldier after they return from their deployment or are retired. It is a federal government program that is failing. 


Why not use the VA money to give an HSA account to veterans to purchase care wherever they want. If they want to go to Mayo then they may pony up some more money but if they don;t the choose the best care for them.
Can we ask the 40 dead ones that were on the bureaucrat's hidden list sand bagging for his bonus?
As a civilian, I have no problem paying for my health care. However, all military personnel should receive the best Health Care free of charge, footed by us taxpayers. They make the numerous sacrifices for our country and we owe it back to them for their service.
And there we go with Bush. You do realize another president has been in office for 5 years, right?
Army Specialist Isaac Sims died in a gunfight with police this Memorial Day weekend after he had been told to "come back later" multiple times  from the VA when he desperately needed help with PTSD. 

Thank you for your service. Now expect to die at home because we don't feel like taking care of you.
His use of 'we' implied that he was speaking for more than just himself with an implication for all vets.
Probably not the same 50% of the population that voted for Bush, twice
The research?  why don't you research Army Specialist Isaac Sims who died in a gunfight with police this Memorial Day weekend after he had been told to "come back later" multiple times from the VA when he desperately needed help with PTSD. 


Thank you for your service. Now expect to die at home because we don't feel like taking care of you.
They do have a choice. It may not be financially wise, but they do have a choice.
Because we paid with our youth, our limbs, our physical and mental health, etc.
Then seek healthcare elsewhere.  It is an option, you know.
How can you like or not like a mandatory service? 


Also, vets hate the wait times, the nursing staff and the turnover of physicians. Just ask a vet whether they would go to the VA or another hospital if they had the CHOICE.
he didn't say he spoke for all vets. and NEVER said all vets are unhappy with their care.  your deflection is noted...
No we don't. 
Then why don't you pay for your own? You can do that, you know?
"The lack of reason and logic in this country never ceases to amaze me"

That's exactly what I think of those that voted for the current president TWICE
3 Uncles who are vets and love their healthcare - of course the right will jump on anything blaming Obama even though they know full well an isolated incident being covered up from select individual that it virtually impossible to police everything.  It just makes the right look more dumb blaming the president over a VA hospital incident that most likely has been going on for 20+ years with no other accountability from any other prior presidents
Yea,  just keep repeating that comment just like republicans repeated the comment You didn't build that.  See where it got them.
Right... and of course, you speak for all vets.


The lack of reason and logic in this country never ceases to amaze me.  The thought that, because I dont like something, everyone must not like it...is just ridiculous, and is pervasive in American thought.


There are issues at the VA, to be sure, but to say that all vets arent happy with their care is just disingenuous.  No one is completely happy with anything, and if you think that private healthcare is going to be any better in about 3-5 years, when the tsunami of elderly swamp the system, then you are sadly mistaken.


Too many...there are just too many of us, and we grow exponentially every year.  Do the math.
You have no idea what she said.   I doubt you even know the definition of "context"...
Ignorance is bliss. Let's ask those who died awaiting care how much they liked it.
It is in context - Obama acts in the way that Hillary speaks --- he does NOTHING
Yes we do.
No we don't.  We just deal with it as best as possible.
Mjority of vets like their healthcare. Just go do the research.
so you think Cankles did not mean what she said?
interesting
Taking comments out of context worked out so well for republicans in the 2012 election
Our next Commander will spell this all out:  "What difference does it make now"
