http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/22/politics/steyer-climate-change-campaign/index.html	Green billionaire prepares to attack 'anti-science' Republicans - CNN.com	2014/05/22	Washington (CNN) -- An environmental advocacy group backed by hedge fund tycoon Tom Steyer is set to unleash a seven-state, $100 million offensive against Republican "science deniers" this year, a no-holds-barred campaign-style push from the green billionaire that could help decide which party controls the Senate and key statehouses come November. The Steyer-backed outside group, NextGen Climate, has billed itself as a progressive, pro-environment counterbalance to the wealthy oil and gas industry -- as well as the primary foil to the pro-business Koch brothers and their well-funded conservative donor network. The outfit, launched last year by the San Francisco billionaire, has already pledged to spend heavily this midterm year in Iowa to assist the Democratic Senate nominee Bruce Braley, and in Florida, where Gov. Rick Scott is facing a difficult re-election fight against Democrat Charlie Crist. Steyer's 2014 map now includes Senate races in Michigan, New Hampshire and Colorado as well as governor's races in Maine and Pennsylvania, home to two of the most endangered Republican governors in the country, Paul LePage and Tom Corbett. "This is the year, in our view, that we are able to demonstrate that you can use climate, you can do it well, you can do it in a smart way, to win political races," said Chris Lehane, the longtime Democratic consultant advising Steyer. Lehane and NextGen political strategist Sky Gallegos revealed their 2014 strategy Wednesday in a briefing with reporters in Washington. 'Pro-climate action' vs. 'anti-science' Absent from their list of 2014 targets: must-win Senate races for Democrats in conservative-leaning states such as Arkansas, Alaska, North Carolina, Louisiana and Kentucky. That's because Democrats on those ballots have expressed support for the Keystone XL pipeline, the coal industry, offshore drilling or hydraulic fracturing -- all nonstarter issues for environmentalists. Instead, Lehane said the 501(c)4 group will play in races that feature a stark choice between "pro-climate action" candidates -- all Democrats -- and "anti-science" Republicans who have questioned the veracity of climate change or supported the interests of the oil and gas industry. GOP candidates in the NextGen cross hairs -- Scott in Florida, Terri Lynn Land in Michigan, Scott Brown in New Hampshire and Cory Gardner in Colorado -- hew closely to the "Republican troglodyte brand," Lehane argued. "They are anti-immigrant, anti-women, anti-science," he said. "It's a tough brand to win elections around." The group said that climate can be successfully used as a wedge issue -- Lehane framed it as a moral clash between "right and wrong" -- to boost turnout among Democratic voting groups that tend not to show up in midterm election years, specifically young voters, Hispanics and African-Americans. As in the Virginia governor's race last year -- when Steyer spent nearly $8 million on a campaign to disqualify GOP nominee Ken Cuccinelli with a combination of TV, mail and field operations -- the efforts will extend beyond the TV airwaves and include what they call "nano-targeting" to tailor messaging to discrete voting groups. "We are not some super PAC that's going to come in, throw up some ads and leave," Lehane said. "You can come into these states and really run a total campaign." Focusing on hyper-local issues Lehane said the effort, which is budgeted at around $100 million but could grow, will focus attention on hyper-local issues -- such as drought in Iowa or flood insurance costs in Florida -- that could influence voter perceptions in key pockets of each state. Pollution-related health concerns such as asthma and clean drinking water hit home for lower-income voters, he said. It wasn't lost on reporters that the NextGen map featured multiple states that figure prominently in presidential races -- Iowa, New Hampshire and Florida among them. Lehane said that was by design. "Almost all of these states align with being really important presidential states either in the primary process or the general election," he said, promising that Steyer will be active throughout the 2016 campaign. When the 2016 presidential primary campaigns lurch into overdrive next year, NextGen will continue to call attention to turnout-driving local issues -- and on attacking Republican candidates. Steyer has already funded an ad in Florida attacking Sen. Marco Rubio, one of many possible GOP White House aspirants, as a tool of oil lobbyists. "We look forward to a conversation with the Rubios of the world," Lehane said of the group's 2016 plans, without revealing specifics. The outside air cover should come as welcome news to Democratic candidates in their target states who are drowning in a flood of TV ads from conservative groups such as the Koch-endorsed Americans for Prosperity. But the campaign may put some Democrats in a bind. In Colorado, for instance, Lehane said NextGen will attack Gardner by showcasing his support for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and the adverse health effects of natural gas extraction on suburban communities. But the strategy could force Democratic Sen. Mark Udall to take a definitive stand on a divisive state issue that pits the business community against environmentalists, an important slice of the Democratic base. Meanwhile, the state's Democrat governor, John Hickenlooper, has been cautiously supportive of the gas industry as a revenue and jobs creator. Charges of hypocrisy As the founder of the hedge fund Farallon Capital Management, Steyer made part of his fortune from investments in fossil fuels, including foreign coal investments, which has prompted charges of hypocrisy from the Koch-affiliated groups he's fond of condemning. "Tom Steyer's investments at Farallon have lined his pockets with millions of dollars from the foreign coal industry," said James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners, the Koch-backed political network. "Now he wants to burden the American people with new energy regulations to protect his current green energy investments. He's already attempting to buy the votes of Senate Democrats on Keystone, which will cost America thousands of good-paying jobs. Surely the media will call him out on the hypocrisy of his claims." Lehane said Steyer ordered his investments be diverted from coal and tar sands when he stepped down from Farallon in 2012 but was not aware if he had investments in other energy sectors. But the primary difference between Steyer and conservative mega-donors, Lehane said, is that Steyer is not personally profiting from his political efforts. "He is giving all the money away," he said. "He doesn't have stand to gain some economic benefit by spending money that translates into his own personal economics." Lehane added, "We are spending a drop in the big oil bucket as compared to the fossil fuel industry, especially the Koch brothers. All Tom is trying to do is try to balance and level the playing field. We are never going to have as much money as the other side."  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/22/politics/gop-clinton-young-voters/index.html	GOP tries to define Clinton for young voters - CNN.com	2014/05/22	Washington (CNN) -- In presidential politics, very little is random. And the recent questions about Hillary Clinton's age and health is anything but. National Republicans, as well as anti-Clinton outside groups and right-wing blogs, have stepped up efforts to redefine Clinton, despite her nearly 40 years on the political stage. At the heart of this effort is one group of voters: young people. Republicans think that young voters -- particularly Americans who were in diapers or listening to N*SYNC during the eight years that Hillary Clinton lived in the White House -- could use a refresher course on all things Clinton. Republicans feel young people could use their version of Clinton's history - and might be impressionable over what might seem like distant history. They have stepped up their message and research efforts to rehash the news of the '90s -- including the policies and scandals that defined the years from 1992 to 2000 -- as part of their wider campaign against her as she mulls another run for president. Democrats charge that the Republican campaign is just "dredging up" old news. Republicans describe it as "citing" recent history. Rove attack was clumsy but shrewd "There is a whole swath of voters out there who obviously know of Hillary Clinton and understand who the Clintons are, but they don't know of her as the politician, they don't know the specifics about her time in the White House," Kirsten Kukowski, spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, said. Details about the Clinton White House years is not old news for people who were in "grade school" at the time, she said. The strategy has obvious pitfalls. Republicans risk looking petty by bringing up old scandals. And it hinges on the assumption that young voters will be receptive to Republican views of Clinton, who is liked by nearly two thirds of those between 18-29 sampled in a recent Quinnipiac University Poll. "Republicans have been good lately at proving they are all about the past while Secretary Clinton is busy looking to the future," said Adrienne Elrod, communications director for Correct the Record, a pro-Clinton rapid response organization. "But, if Republicans want to spend money educating young voters about how strong the economy was under President Clinton's leadership in the 90s and how American broad-based prosperity was was at an all time high, who are we to stop them?" Clinton under fire for age, health Clinton is also one of the most recognizable people in America. In recent polls. She has more than 95% name recognition with U.S. voters and is considered the overwhelming favorite to win the Democratic nomination, if she runs. Republicans, however, feel they can still define her on their terms. "While a lot people assume everyone knows Hillary, people under 30 don't know specifics," Kukowski said. "We need to be out there framing her early." Republicans pounce on Margolies' defeat "What is Hillary Clinton's biggest accomplishment?" As Clinton weighs a White House run in 2016, Republicans want young voters to think about this: What is Hillary Clinton's biggest accomplishment? "I think that is going to be a big issue in framing the debate and framing who Hillary is to those voters," Kukowski said. Conservative blogs and publications have seemingly taken cues from the RNC on this question. Just last week, PJTV, a "center-right online news and commentary" website sent a reporter to George Washington University to question students about Clinton's record. In a three-minute video that has bounced around right wing blogs, students seem unable to answer the question and those who respond offer meager answers (one even cites Clinton's handling of Benghazi as an accomplishment). Other blogs and right-leaning outlets have sent reporters to Democratic National Committee meetings and college campuses to ask questions about Clinton's record and history of political positions. Kukowski said she didn't know if that format comes directly from the RNC, but did say, "We do have somebody here that works with conservative bloggers all day every day." The Republican strategy extends beyond the right wing blogosphere, too. Top Republican strategists, like Karl Rove, have shown how Republican might try to bring up Clinton's age and health in a campaign. Rove dropped questions about Clinton's health at an event that was picked up by a newspaper. He doubled down on the comments, drawing condemnation from Democrats. The strategy worked, however, as it dominated news about Clinton for two days. Patrick: All this attention could hurt Clinton Digging back into the '90s Although Democrats have called Rove "sleazy," the stepped up attacks have already had an impact on the early 2016 presidential wrangling by solidifying what Republicans have been saying for months: Hillary Clinton is who they see as the most formidable potential candidate. Representatives from a handful of Republican groups said they plan to operate as if she is running or until she says otherwise. But the comments have also forced Clinton into the political fray. She had tried to stay above politics for months by giving high-profile paid speeches and traveling the country. But as Clinton began to raise her profile, Republicans began to step up their attacks and force a response. When she left the State Department, she joked with friends and confidants that she was looking forward to the "speeches and beaches" time of her life. That time appears to be over. In the past two weeks, she has dipped her toes into domestic politics, including her first congressional fundraiser of the midterms -- for a candidate who eventually lost, and has started to regularly tout her husband's record in the White House. "The 1990s taught us that even in the face of difficult long term economic trends, it is possible through smart policies and sound investments to enjoy broad-based growth and shared prosperity," Clinton said during a speech at the New America Foundation. She added that her husband's years in the White House showed that "a rising tide really did raise all boats." Tim Miller, executive director of the anti-Clinton America Rising PAC, said comments like that are an acknowledgment that she knows their time in the White House from 1993-2001 will be an issue if she runs. "We are very conscious of the fact that there is a big slice of the electorate that does not have a full picture of Hillary Clintons record," Miller said. "I think that with the Clintons would like to rely on is a nostalgic strategy with regards to their time in the White House in the '90s and don't want to get down into the details." Miller, whose super PAC has a cadre of researchers diving into the Clinton record, said there will be an obvious focus on what younger voters need to know about her time in the White House. Miller added that while he doesn't think the 2016 election will be won or lost on issues like Whitewater and other Clinton White House scandals, he does think informing young voters, especially, about them is necessary. "I do think that for the generation that didn't live through that, that there is some value having the discussion," he added. Right now, America Rising has roughly 60 full-time employees working for the organization, many of whom are primarily focused on cultivating research documents about Clinton's world in the '80s and '90s. Solidifying a definition Defining a candidate early is nothing new in presidential politics, either. President Barack Obama's campaign famously began to define Republican challenger Mitt Romney as out-of-touch early in the race. His team went up with ads early and spent tons of cash, hoping that Romney would be defined on their terms to many voters by final months of the campaign. "What happens is often times if you don't introduce yourself, then you are leaving that task to the opposition," said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist and Romney spokesman. "What happens is when the oppositions provides a greater reservoir of information about you and it is negative then it is tough to turn around those perceptions." Obama prevailed in a campaign that many saw as perilous for him. But defining Clinton before she has said whether she will run or not is somewhat unprecedented. Republicans say that is only because of the unprecedented shadow campaign around Clinton right now. "The strategy is to force her out of the shadow campaign she is winning by acclimation," said Leslie Sanchez, a Republican strategist and the author of "You've Come a Long Way, Maybe." "That is the undercurrent here in bringing out issues about health or legacy. (Republicans aren't) going to allow Hillary Clinton to be anointed without taking the heat."

"I am a strong Kentucky woman who is an independent thinker," Grimes told supporters Tuesday night. Grimes is already leaning way in -- using her gender to appeal to female voters, who make up more than half the Kentucky electorate. And she's playing up the fact that polls show 30-year Senate veteran McConnell is especially unpopular with women. Grimes connected to big donors, big hitters On the eve of his Republican primary, we asked McConnell whether he suffered from a gender gap problem. "We'll find out in November, won't we?" McConnell said. "I mean, the point is women in Kentucky have been treated just as badly in this environment as men have." But McConnell's overt appeal to women belies that bravado. In his victory speech Tuesday, the most powerful Republican in the Senate spoke glowingly of both his late mother and his wife Elaine Chao, a former cabinet secretary under George W. Bush. And McConnell told the stories of three Kentucky women he said were hurt by President Barack Obama's health care law. Democrats' other big hope for picking up a GOP Senate seat is Michelle Nunn, daughter of veteran Sen. Sam Nunn, in Georgia. "I believe that change is possible," she said in a speech on Tuesday. Gloves are off in marquee Senate battle As for Republicans, Monica Wehby is a pediatric neurosurgeon hoping to unseat Democrat Jeff Merkley in Oregon, running as a political outsider. "I'm not a career politician," Wehby said in a speech Tuesday night. Republicans are favored to pick up a Democratic seat in West Virginia with Shelley Moore Capito, but even if she loses to Democrat Natalie Tennant, either way the state would elect its first female senator. There are currently 20 women senators, a record but still far from representative of the country, which is more than 50% female. 2014 could mark another historic number.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/22/politics/va-waiting-lists/index.html	Lawmaker: VA wait-list, cover-up allegations 'tip of the iceberg' - CNN.com	2014/05/22	(CNN) -- It's "just the tip of the iceberg." That's what a congressional committee chairman investigating allegations of delayed care and cooked books at Veterans Affairs health care facilities told CNN. Rep. Jeff Miller, a Florida Republican who heads the House Veterans Affairs panel, on Thursday forecast more serious developments in the national program serving nearly 9 million veterans. "We've received some information and some tips that will make what has already come look like kindergarten stuff," he told CNN's New Day. The controversy has broadened since CNN first reported six months ago on allegations of alarming shortcomings within the VA medical care system that potentially have had deadly consequences in dozens of cases. Developments taking shape on Thursday included a meeting later in the day between embattled Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki and the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, Richard Durbin of Illinois. Shinseki, who has come under pressure from some quarters to step down, told reporters after the meeting that he has not offered his resignation to President Barack Obama, who is standing by him. He later issued a statement to the nation's veterans stressing that the entire matter is the subject of an internal review and an independent investigation. "The reports of veterans' negative experiences while seeking VA care are of great personal concern to me" and promised action if "any allegations under review are substantiated," he said. "As we approach our observance of Memorial Day and its special significance to our nation, VA is re-doubling its efforts, with integrity and compassion, to earn your trust," he added. No shows at meeting The top Republican in Congress weighed in on Thursday with his concerns about allegations of systemic problems at the VA. "I have not called for General Shinseki to resign although I have to admit I am getting a little closer," said House Speaker John Bohener. "But here is the point: This isn't about one person. This isn't about the secretary. It is about the entire system underneath him." Also on Thursday, Robert Jesse, the VA deputy undersecretary, met with members of the House Health Care and Wellness Committee, but three senior VA officials asked to meet with Miller's committee didn't show up. The VA said the committee didn't give it enough notice, an explanation Miller called disingenuous. "My intent is to go ahead and subpoena them" for a hearing before his committee on May 30, Miller said. The officials were identified as Dr. Thomas Lynch, an assistant undersecretary for health and clinical operations; Joan Mooney, an assistant secretary for congressional and legislative affairs, and Michael Huff, a congressional relations officer. Miller has accused the VA of failing to adequately respond to his panel's May 8 subpoena, which included a request for information about the alleged destruction of a secret waiting list for care at the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care System.  In a statement to CNN, the VA said it "is committed to working with the committee to provide relevant information expeditiously" and that it has "produced over 3,000 pages of documents to the committee" so far. Separately, Sen. Marco Rubio sought to advance a proposal that would change federal rules to make it easier to fire VA executives. Similar legislation was approved by the House on Wednesday. Rubio said that Shinseki should have the power to hold people accountable. "Give the secretary the power to fire employees underneath him who are not doing their jobs," he said. "This is a matter of urgency." Obama speaks out The overall scandal prompted a response on Wednesday from Obama, who expressed dismay and demanded accountability, but also said he needed more time to find out what was going on. "If these allegations prove to be true, it is dishonorable, it is disgraceful, and I will not tolerate it, period," Obama said. Obama noted that the public wants a "swift reckoning" on the VA issue, but he defended the record of his administration and Shinseki. Hospital delays are killing war veterans On Wednesday, it was disclosed that some veterans hurt in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan are being made to wait for months to be seen in Phoenix, despite a mandate that they be give priority, according to a VA doctor. Dr. Katherine Mitchell, the medical director of the Phoenix VA's post-deployment clinic, outlined the allegations on CNN's "AC 360." Probing record keeping, lists CNN reported last month that in Phoenix, the department used fraudulent record-keeping -- including the alleged secret list -- that covered up excessive waiting periods for veterans, some of whom died in the process. The list in Phoenix was part of an alleged scheme designed by VA managers there who were trying to hide that 1,400 to 1,600 sick veterans were forced to wait months to see a doctor, according to a recently retired top VA doctor and several high-level sources. Overall, the number of VA facilities under investigation has expanded to 26, the agency's Office of Inspector General said Tuesday. An internal VA memo from 2010 showed officials warned of "inappropriate scheduling practices" to cover up excessive waits for veterans four years ago. But the CNN investigation shows such practices have continued. The VA has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care, and the agency's inspector general has launched an investigation of the Phoenix allegations that involve up to 40 other deaths. At a Senate hearing last week, the inspector general said his investigation so far found a possible 17 deaths of veterans waiting for care in Phoenix but added there was no evidence that excessive waiting was the reason. Obama said Wednesday that the cooked books and excessive waits applied more to veterans with chronic conditions who are among the 85 million VA appointments each year instead of those needing emergency attention. Rights group calls VA 'scapegoat' in scandal over wait times, care CNN's Nelli Black, Paul Courson, Deirdre Walsh, Ted Barrett, Jim Acosta, Virginia Nicolaidis and Becky Brittain contributed to this report. 
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/21/politics/va-hard-to-fire/index.html	VA scandal: Why hasn't anyone been fired yet? - CNN.com	2014/05/21	(CNN) -- An uproar over treatment delays at the Department of Veterans Affairs is triggering a heated debate over whether it is too difficult to fire federal workers, with the House approving legislation on Wednesday that would make it easier to remove senior executives at the agency. The Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act, sponsored by House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller, R-Florida, and passed overwhelmingly, would let the agency secretary immediately fire any of the department's senior executives. Currently, those executives get at least 30 days' notice of potential dismissal and an option to invoke a potentially lengthy appeals process before losing their jobs. For months, Miller has argued that the VA is too reluctant to fire executives, especially those connected to delays in veterans care. The agency is engulfed by a growing controversy over allegations it covered up excessive wait times for veterans at some VA health care facilities. President Barack Obama is resisting calls from some quarters to fire Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki. He said on Wednesday that he needed more time to review what was going on and promised accountability. How many has the VA fired? An argument for change Miller's proposal is a strong statement, but it would affect a relatively small group of federal workers. There are roughly 360 senior executives at Veterans Affairs, according to the Office of Personnel Management. There are 340,000 total employees. But the more important figure to look at may be the number of execs fired recently. CNN analysis of OPM data found the VA fired two senior executives last year. And that was much higher than usual. During the four years from 2008-2012, only one other senior executive was terminated for cause from the agency, according to the personnel data. The VA's executive firing rate last year was in line with the 0.47% termination-for-cause rate of the federal government overall, according to the OPM statistics. But, the trend over the past five years shows a substantial difference at the VA. From 2008-2013, the VA fired executives at a rate one-fourth the firing rate for government overall, according to the OPM data. And even last year, when the VA was in line with the rest of the federal government on firing, critics still see that as a significant problem because the rates of termination in the federal government are substantially lower than in the private sector. The 0.47% federal rate is roughly a third of that for the private sector, according to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics data. "I actually think the federal workforce would be better off with more firing or at least as much as in the private sector," argued Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute. "The good workers get disheartened and demoralized if they see these non-performing workers making as much as them and they're not doing their job." The danger of politics, an argument for workers But just as some conservatives cry for removing red tape and speeding up the firing process for government executives, others insist the idea could easily harm good employees at the VA. "What happens is the politics get ahead of the facts," said Joe Kaplan, an attorney who has worked on federal workers' cases for more than 30 years. Kaplan believes the need for potential scapegoats in a crisis could easily lead to abuse under Miller's bill. For example, he told the story of an IRS employee who came to his office saying others at the agency had suggested she could be fired and were pressuring her to over a recent high-profile congressional investigation of IRS targeting of conservative political groups. Kaplan looked at her case, saw no evidence of wrong doing and advised her to stay put. She did, and was not fired. "For political reasons, things can get blown out of proportion easily," Kaplan concluded. "And is it good that private employers can fire people without any cause? We should want the federal government to be a model employer." Others argue something more: that allowing a political appointee, like a Cabinet secretary, to fire people at will could threaten American-style democracy. That it could invite patronage and corruption, something that was in full bloom until President Chester Arthur signed the first civil service reform act in 1883. "It's really important in a political system to maintain a third party review of personnel actions," said Max Stier, president of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service which focuses on strengthening civil service. "The operations of government need to be different in some ways than they are in the private sector. We don't want a government that is staffed according to political persuasion," he said. Stier believes the system needs to change, that there may be too much red tape. But he argues that Congress needs to revamp the entire, outdated federal personnel policy for the government, not just make a sudden change at the VA. "It's the whole system that needs to be reviewed," he asserted. Why the change at the VA? Why now? Miller insists that as it is now, the VA is not a meritocracy. That instead, poor performers who oversee failing areas, may be rewarded with bonuses. "In instance after instance where mismanagement has led to veteran suffering, department officials have repeatedly pointed to non-disciplinary actions such as employee retirements and transfers or bureaucratic slaps on the wrist," said Miller when he introduced his bill in March. He called those actions "a disingenuous attempt to create the appearance of accountability." Secretary won't quit Shinseki has not publicly commented on whether he would like more power to fire executives. Now that the House has acted, the matter moves over to the Senate where Florida's Marco Rubio has introduced a companion bill. It's not clear if it will be considered. But for now, Shinseki has no plans to fire himself, saying he isn't resigning. Nor has he said if he is in the process of firing any VA employees as a result of the scandal. Some, including the head of the Phoenix branch where problems were first discovered, have been suspended. Did he say anything in his testimony why he couldn't? Senators asked the agency leader directly at a hearing last week on the scandal. "Have you ever fired anyone on this issue?" Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, questioned Shinseki. Shinseki replied that he needed to look through the agencies records to check. But would he fire someone because of the scandal? "I will do everything I can," Shinseki demurred. "That's not the question," replied Begich. "There is a process here," Shinseki summarize, "let me not get out ahead of it." Obama management style under fire again with VA  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/22/politics/white-house-under-siege/index.html	Confronting crisis the norm for Obama's White House - CNN.com	2014/05/22	Washington (CNN) -- It's become a familiar pattern in Washington. A new controversy emerges. Media reports raise questions, and Republican critics hurl accusations. President Barack Obama stays hidden from scrutiny, leaving spokesman Jay Carney to bob and weave like a cornered boxer in the White House briefing room. Only under heightened public anger and political pressure does Obama emerge, such as Wednesday's hastily arranged news conference intended to tamp down a growing uproar over allegations of sometimes deadly waits for care at Veterans Affairs hospitals. Read the story that helped expose the problem The result? A growing perception of a White House under siege as Obama's presidency approaches its two-thirds mark, struggling with a litany of problems that overwhelm any administration successes. Some involve serious missteps, like the dysfunctional Obamacare website last fall that temporarily undermined progress on the President's signature achievement. Others are more politically contrived controversies made more prominent in an election year, such as Republican hounding over the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack and IRS targeting of groups seeking tax exempt status. The GOP seeks to portray Obama as ineffective and even negligent, with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell complaining Thursday that "the most powerful man in the free world always seems to be the last to know about what's going on in his own administration." Meanwhile, Democratic colleagues who face tough congressional elections in November distance themselves from a President with negative approval ratings. Here are the major controversies that have confronted the Obama administration, with a look at how we got here and what they mean: Veterans Affairs: A long-time problem getting worse As a U.S. senator, Obama sat on the Veterans' Affairs Committee and campaigned for president on resolving problems faced by returning soldiers. Now he finds himself under heavy criticism for what critics call a delayed and weak response to excessive and sometimes deadly waits for care at VA hospitals and alleged practices to cover them up, as uncovered by a CNN investigation. The VA has acknowledged 23 deaths in several states due to delays in care, and sources told CNN that as many as 40 veterans died under similar circumstances in Phoenix. Such problems touch on an emotional topic -- caring for America's military veterans, many of whom served in war -- and the revelations of scheduling tricks and secret lists to hide months-long waits sparked outrage across the political spectrum. Lawmaker: VA wait-list, cover-up allegations 'tip of the iceberg'  So far, Obama ordered his deputy chief of staff, Rob Nabors, to review what was happening at the VA. Robert Petzel, a VA undersecretary for health care, was forced out shortly before his planned retirement this year, and the department's inspector general has launched an independent investigation. Republicans, veterans groups and some Democrats say that's not enough, with increasing calls for Obama to fire Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki as part of a broad housecleaning. In his first public remarks on the matter in weeks, Obama on Wednesday continued to back Shinseki while promising punishment for any proven misconduct. Wait until we have the facts before deciding on how to proceed, he urged. Obama noted his administration's efforts to provide veterans with expanded services, access to education and help finding jobs, but his remarks disappointed critics. The American Legion called Obama's decision to keep Shinseki in office "unfortunate," while Republican leaders said the President must address systemic problems at VA that involve much more than the possible removal of the Cabinet secretary. "The general can leave and we can wait around for months to go through a nomination process and we get a new person, but the disaster continues," House Speaker John Boehner told reporters on Thursday. The GOP-led House passed a bill giving Shinseki greater authority to fire top managers, and some in Congress urged Obama to delegate such power by executive action to speed the process. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who pushed Thursday for an immediate Senate vote on the House measure, said: "I don't think that any of us want to go home for the Memorial Day recess and when we are asked `what are you doing on this issue?' our answer is `well, in about 15 days we are going to have a hearing on this crisis.'" Doctor: Phoenix VA ignores mandate to prioritize Iraq, Afghanistan vets Obamacare: the GOP's boogeyman Socialism! Death panels! For four years, Republicans mustered unrelenting and vitriolic attacks on Obama's signature health care legislation that passed with no GOP votes in 2010. From presidential nominee Mitt Romney on down, Republicans made repeal of the Affordable Care Act a major issue of the 2012 election and continued efforts to undermine its implementation even after Obama won a second term. The GOP efforts appeared increasingly negligible until the Obamacare website meltdown. What should have been the crowning moment of the reform process -- the October 1, 2013, rollout of exchanges for uninsured people to buy newly affordable health coverage -- became a full-blown crisis when the government website didn't work. Republican critics regained their vigor, insisting the episode showed the Obamacare reforms as a whole didn't work. Carney came under withering questioning, while Obama dispatched a top White House aide to get the website functioning properly. The President also backed Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, the administration's focal point for implementing the reforms, at least until the website got working again and the sign-up period concluded at the end of March with enrollment exceeding goals. Then Sebelius stepped down. Sebelius had 'toughest job in Washington' Benghazi: A "twofer" for Republicans A tragedy in which four Americans died in a terrorist attack now symbolizes the political dysfunction in Washington. In the midst of the 2012 presidential election, the assault on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, became a campaign flashpoint. Obama was running on foreign policy credentials burnished by the mission that killed Osama bin Laden, boasting al Qaeda was "on the run." His administration initially blamed the Benghazi attack on a spontaneous protest over an anti-Muslim video made in the United States, rather than the seemingly planned assault by well-armed terrorists, some with al Qaeda affiliations. Republicans led by Romney immediately accused the Obama administration of misleading the public on what happened to hide a major security breakdown that signaled the broader failed policy in the region. A special review board set up by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton determined flaws in security planning and made recommendations adopted by the State Department. However, neither the review board nor multiple investigations by congressional committees uncovered the kind of damaging revelation sought by Republicans to hurt both Obama and Clinton, the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 if she decides to run. Now, House Republicans have formed a new select committee to keep public focus on an issue that resonates with conservatives ahead of the November congressional elections. The special investigative panel also offers a continuing attack route against Clinton, with expectations she will be called to testify. Democrats initially balked at being part of the select committee, but House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday named five members to join seven Republicans on the panel. Dianne Feinstein on Benghazi panel: 'It's a hunting mission for a lynch mob' IRS: An easy target Everybody hates the tax collector, and revelations of political targeting by the Internal Revenue Service gave conservatives even more reason to pile on. Republicans have tried to maintain public focus on the evolving IRS targeting scandal, inferring it could reach to the top levels of the Obama administration. No evidence so far from several congressional investigations has revealed direct political motivation or any involvement from outside the IRS. Both liberal and conservative groups were flagged when assessing their eligibility for a tax break available to social welfare organizations. However, only conservative groups faced delayed processing and inappropriate questioning about political activity that would make them ineligible, according to IRS officials. The focus on tea party affiliated groups stoked conservative anger and a GOP talking point that lumps the controversy with others during the Obama presidency. "From the Obama administration's IRS scandal, to its Obamacare website fiasco, just about every time the president claims to be in the dark until the wrongdoing surfaces on its own usually in the press," McConnell said Thursday. Government goes back to the drawing board on regulating controversial tax-exempt groups Ukraine: measured response labeled weakness It all happened so fast -- a Russian incursion in February that seized control of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. The expansionist move by Russian President Vladimir Putin immediately set up a "Russia versus the West" showdown, pitting Moscow against the United States and its European allies. Preceding all that was a veritable coup in Ukraine driven by pro-European populism that ousted the pro-Russian prime minister. Putin acted amid the political chaos in the former Soviet satellite to annex Crimea, which has a majority ethnic Russian population and hosts Russia's vital Black Sea fleet. Despite calls by conservatives for arming Ukraine, Obama acted in concert with NATO allies in Europe, imposing sanctions but ruling out a military response over Crimea. However, he and his NATO counterparts declared they would uphold their treaty obligation to protect any alliance member from a similar Russian push, and they boosted military exercises in the region. No matter the foreign policy issue, Obama comes under criticism for policies that seek to reduce the U.S. military footprint abroad and promote collaboration with allies instead of the American "first in" approach of the past. Longtime foes such as Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina complain such a measured response weakens the nation's standing in the world. Obama argues his way avoids mistakes such as leaping into a war in Iraq over the false perception that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. "Why is it that everybody is so eager to use military force after we've just gone through a decade of war at enormous costs to our troops and to our budget?" he asked during a trip to Asia last month. His approach may not bring dynamic results, he added, "but we steadily advance the interests of the American people and our partnerships with folks around the world." Poll: Growing concern over Ukraine but little support for military action Syria: Whose red line? If Obama regrets anything, it is probably his declaration in 2012 that the Syrian government's use of chemical weapons against its own people would cross a "red line" for a U.S. military response. The phrase has become synonymous with empty threats, and analysts say Obama's failure to follow through on his warning against President Bashar al-Assad's regime undermined confidence by U.S. allies around the world that Washington would have their back in a crisis. In the end, though, Obama appeared to get what he wanted without putting any U.S. troops at risk, as Syria -- under pressure from ally Russia -- handed over more than 90% of its declared chemical weapons arsenal to the international community. Talks with Russia and Syria continue on eliminating the rest by a June 30 deadline, a target that analysts believe is unlikely to be met. Critics contend the President's stance has failed to curb the al-Assad regime or stop the civil war blamed for more than 100,000 deaths. In particular, some lament the lack of a U.S. military response to chemical weapons attacks in Syria last year. Secretary of State John Kerry argued last month that the U.S. approach emphasizing diplomacy yielded a better result. "Would you rather drop a few bombs, send a message, and then have him (al-Assad) still with the weapons and capacity to deliver them?" Kerry asked the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he used to chair. "Or would you rather get all of them out?" Setback for ending the 'never-ending' war  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/23/politics/va-scandals-timeline/index.html	The VA's troubled history - CNN.com	2014/05/23	(CNN) -- Scandal, controversy and veterans care in the United States have gone hand-in-hand for virtually as long as there's been a republic. After the Revolutionary War, for instance, payments promised by Congress to disabled veterans were left up to the states, and only a few thousand of those who served ever received anything, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Here's a time line of the many scandals the department and its predecessors have faced: 1921 -- Congress creates the Veterans Bureau to administer assistance to World War I veterans. It quickly devolves into corruption, and is abolished nine years later under a cloud of scandal. 1930 -- The Veterans Administration is established to replace the troubled Veterans Bureau and two other agencies involved in veterans' care. 1932 -- Thousands of World War I veterans and their families march on Washington to demand payment of promised war bonuses. In an embarrassing spectacle, federal troops forcibly remove veterans who refuse to end their protest. 1945 -- President Harry Truman accepts the resignation of VA Administrator Frank Hines after a series of news reports detailing shoddy care in VA-run hospitals, according to a 2010 history produced by the Independent Institute. 1946 -- The American Legion leads the charge seeking the ouster of VA Administrator Gen. Omar Bradley, citing an ongoing lack of facilities, troubles faced by hundreds of thousands of veterans in getting services and a proposal to limit access to services for some combat veterans, according to the 2010 history. 1947 -- A government commission on reforming government uncovers enormous waste, duplication and inadequate care in the VA system and calls for wholesale changes in the agency's structure. 1955 -- A second government reform commission again finds widespread instances of waste and poor care in the VA system, according to the Independent Institute. 1970s -- Veterans grow increasingly frustrated with the VA for failing to better fund treatment and assistance programs, and later to recognize exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange by troops in Vietnam as the cause for numerous medical problems among veterans. 1972 -- Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic, the subject of the book and movie, "Born on the Fouth of July," interrupts Richard Nixon's GOP presidential nomination acceptance speech, saying, according to his biography, "I'm a Vietnam veteran. I gave America my all, and the leaders of this government threw me and others away to rot in their VA hospitals." 1974 -- Kovic leads a 19-day hunger strike at a federal building in Los Angeles to protest poor treatment of veterans in VA hospitals. He and fellow veterans demand to meet with VA Director Donald Johnson. The embattled director eventually flies to California to meet with the activists, but leaves after they reject his demand to meet in the VA's office in the building, according to Johnson's 1999 Los Angeles Times obituary. The ensuing uproar results in widespread criticism of Johnson. A few weeks later, Johnson resigns after President Richard Nixon announces an investigation into VA operations. 1976 -- A General Accounting Office investigation into Denver's VA hospital finds numerous shortcomings in patient care, including veterans whose surgical dressings are rarely changed. The GAO also looked at the New Orleans VA hospital, and found ever-increasing patient loads were contributing to a decline in the quality of care there, as well. 1981 -- Veterans camp out in front of the Wadsworth Veterans Medical Center in Los Angeles after the suicide of a former Marine who had rammed the hospital's lobby with his Jeep and fired shots into the wall after claiming the VA had failed to attend to his service-related disabilities, the New York Times reported at the time. 1982 -- Controversial VA director Robert Nimmo, who once described symptoms of exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange during the Vietnam war as little more than "teenage acne," resigns under pressure from veteran's groups. Nimmo was criticized for wasteful spending, including use of a chauffeured car and an expensive office redecorating project, according to a 1983 GAO investigation. The same year, the agency issues a report supporting veterans' claims that the VA had failed to provide them with enough information and assistance about Agent Orange exposure. 1984 -- Congressional investigators find evidence that VA officials had diverted or refused to spend more than $40 million that Congress approved to help Vietnam veterans with readjustment problems, the Washington Post reports at the time. 1986 -- The VA's Inspector General's office finds 93 physicians working for the agency have sanctions against their medical licenses, including suspensions and revocations, according to a 1988 GAO report. 1989 -- President Ronald Reagan signs legislation elevating the Veterans Administration to Cabinet status, creating the Department of Veterans Affairs. 1991 -- The Chicago Tribune reports that doctors at the VA's North Chicago hospital sometimes ignored test results, failed to treat patients in a timely manner and conducted unnecessary surgery. The agency later takes responsibility for the deaths of eight patients, leading to the suspension of most surgery at the center, the newspaper reported. 1993 -- VA Deputy Undersecretary of Benefits R.J. Vogel testifies to Congress that a growing backlog of appeals from veterans denied benefits is due to a federal court established in 1988 to oversee the claims process, the Washington Post reports. The VA, Vogel tells the lawmakers, is "reeling under this judicial review thing." 1999 -- Lawmakers open an investigation into widespread problems with clinical research procedures at the VA West Los Angeles Healthcare Center. The investigation followed years of problems at the hospital, including ethical violations by hospital researchers that included failing to get consent from some patients before conducting research involving them, according to the Los Angeles Times. 2000 -- The GAO finds "substantial problems" with the VA's handling of research trials involving human subjects. 2001 -- Despite a 1995 goal to reduce waiting times for primary care and specialty appointments to less than 30 days, the GAO finds that veterans still often wait more than two months for appointments. 2003 -- A commission appointed by President George W. Bush reports that as of January 2003, some 236,000 veterans had been waiting six months or more for initial or follow-up visits, "a clear indication," the commission said, "of lack of sufficient capacity or, at a minimum, a lack of adequate resources to provide the required care." 2005 -- An anonymous tip leads to revelations of "significant problems with the quality of care" for surgical patients at the VA's Salisbury, North Carolina, hospital, according to congressional testimony. One veteran who sought treatment for a toenail injury died of heart failure after doctors failed to take account of his enlarged heart, according to testimony. 2006 -- Sensitive records containing the names, Social Security numbers and birth dates of 26.5 million veterans are stolen from the home of a VA employee who did not have authority to take the materials. VA officials think the incident was a random burglary and not a targeted theft. 2007 -- Outrage erupts after documents released to CNN show some senior VA officials received bonuses of up to $33,000 despite a backlog of hundreds of thousands of benefits cases and an internal review that found numerous problems, some of them critical, at VA facilities across the nation. 2009 -- The VA discloses that than 10,000 veterans who underwent colonoscopies in Tennessee, Georgia and Florida were exposed to potential viral infections due to poorly disinfected equipment. Thirty-seven tested positive for two forms of hepatitis and six tested positive for HIV. VA Director Eric Shinseki initiates disciplinary actions and requires hospital directors to provide written verification of compliance with VA operating procedures. The head of the Miami VA hospital is removed as a result, the Miami Herald reports. 2011 -- Nine Ohio veterans test positive for hepatitis after routine dental work at a VA clinic in Dayton, Ohio. A dentist at the VA medical center there acknowledged not washing his hands or even changing gloves between patients for 18 years. 2011 -- An outbreak of Legionnaires' Disease begins at the VA hospital in Oakland, Pennsylvania, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. At least five veterans die of the disease over the next two years. In 2013, the newspaper discloses VA records showed evidence of widespread contamination of the facility dating back to 2007. 2012 -- The VA finds that the graves of at least 120 veterans in agency-run cemeteries are misidentified. The audit comes in the wake of a scandal at the Army's Arlington National Cemetery involving unmarked graves and incorrectly placed burials. 2013 -- The former director of Veteran Affairs facilities in Ohio, William Montague, is indicted on charges he took bribes and kickbacks to steer VA contracts to a company that does business with the agency nationwide. January 2014 -- CNN reports that at least 19 veterans died at VA hospitals in 2010 and 2011 because of delays in diagnosis and treatment. April 9 -- Lawmakers excoriate VA officials at a hearing. "This is an outrage! This is an American disaster!" says Rep. Jackie Walorski. April 23 -- At least 40 veterans died while waiting for appointments to see a doctor at the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care system, CNN reports. The patients were on a secret list designed to hide lengthy delays from VA officials in Washington, according to a recently retired VA doctor and several high-level sources. April 28 -- President Barack Obama calls for an investigation into the situation in Phoenix. April 30 -- Top officials at the Phoenix VA deny the existence of a secret appointment waiting list. May 1 -- Shinseki places the director of the Phoenix VA and two aides on administrative leave pending the investigation into the veterans' deaths. May 5 -- Veterans groups call for Shinseki's resignation. American Legion National Commander Daniel Dillinger says the deaths reported by CNN appear to be part of a "pattern of scandals that has infected the entire system." May 6 -- Despite the clamor for Shinseki's ouster, White House spokesman Jay Carney says Obama "remains confident in Secretary Shinseki's ability to lead the department and take appropriate action." Shinseki tells the Wall Street Journal he will not resign. May 8 -- The House Veterans Affairs Committee votes to subpoena Shinseki and others in relation to the Phoenix scandal. May 9 -- The scheduling scandal widens as a Cheyenne, Wyoming, VA employee is placed on administrative leave after an email surfaces in which the employee discusses "gaming the system a bit" to manipulate waiting times. The suspension comes a day after a scheduling clerk in San Antonio admitted to "cooking the books" to shorten apparent waiting times. Three days later, two employees in Durham, North Carolina, are placed on leave over similar allegations. May 15 -- Shinseki testifies before the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. "Any allegation, any adverse incident like this makes me mad as hell," he says. At the same hearing, acting Inspector General Richard Griffin tells lawmakers that federal prosecutors are working with his office looking into allegations veterans died while waiting for appointments. May 19 -- Three supervisors at the Gainesville, Florida, VA hospital are placed on paid leave after investigators find a list of patients requiring follow-up care kept on paper, not in the VA's computerized scheduling system. May 20 -- The VA's Office of Inspector General says it is investigating 26 agency facilities for allegations of doctored waiting times. May 21 -- Obama says he "will not stand" for misconduct at VA hospitals, but asks for time to allow the investigation to run its course. The same day, Shinseki rescinds Phoenix VA director Sharon Helman's $8,495 bonus. Helman got the bonus in April, even as agency investigators were looking into allegations at the facility. May 22 -- The chairman of the House Veteran Affairs Committee says his group has received information "that will make what has already come out look like kindergarten stuff." He does not elaborate.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/23/politics/julian-castro-profile/index.html	Julian Castro's rapid rise no surprise to Texas pals - CNN.com	2014/05/23	Washington (CNN) -- Julian Castro, the mayor of San Antonio, and Mike Villarreal, the city's representative in the state legislature, saw potential in an historic, amoeba-shaped park parcel near the city's convention center. So, the two set to work. They secured the civic support, government approval and funding needed to turn HemisFair Park into a place where playgrounds and mixed income housing will one day overlook a grassy span and the Tower of the Americas  an observation tower marking the park's location as the site of the 1968 World's Fair. As President Barack Obama's choice to become the next housing secretary, a focus on helping revitalize inner-city areas, colleagues in Texas say, will stand the 39-year-old mayor in good stead. "Based on his focus here in San Antonio on working to improve housing in the city's core and inner city, I suspect he would advance an agenda that has in mind family and children," said Villarreal, who is vying to replace Castro as mayor. "I think you're going to be seeing a secretary of housing who understands housing on a human level." Obama 's new pick for HUD secretary If confirmed, Castro would head an agency that is still reeling from fallout from the housing crisis  including meeting mushrooming demands for affordable rental housing. He will also be tasked with helping the financially beleaguered Federal Housing Administration, which has been struggling to cope with a record number of home mortgage defaults. Obama noted during the nomination ceremony that Castro "never forgets where he comes from." He also highlighted Castro's mention of his Mexican-born grandmother in his keynote address to the Democratic convention in 2012 as an immigrant who worked hard to provide a home for her family. "For her and generations like her a home is more than just a house," Obama said. Castro will likely face questions in his confirmation hearings why San Antonio did not follow federal guidelines when it spent millions in HUD funds aimed at helping address the housing crisis during his tenure as mayor, according to a 2012 report by the agency's inspector general. The report found the city did not use a competitive bid process when it awarded $2.5 million for renovation contracts and that it did not follow federal affordability guidelines designed to target lower income residents when it spent just over $1 million to buy and fix up homes. A call to Castro's San Antonio office seeking comment about his HUD nomination was not immediately returned. Still, supporters feel Castro has the right mix of experience to lead the agency. "This economy has not been as robust as we would have hoped," Henry Cisneros, a former HUD secretary and former San Antonio mayor told CNN on Friday. "Part of the reason for that has been because the housing sector has been on the sidelines. But now housing can get into the fray and, as HUD secretary, Castro is well-poised to do that." Cisneros, who says he has discussed housing-related issues with Castro in the past and plans on having additional conversations with him, said that as mayor of San Antonio, the younger man dealt with issues of poverty, homelessness and home affordability and is well suited to the task. Opinion: Why Julian Castro said yes to Obama Texas political consultant Bill Miller also feels Castro is up to the challenge. "He'll be a cool customer. He's not going to get supercharged or over wrought over anything," said Miller who is a founding partner at HillCo Partners in Austin, a state political consulting group. "If there have been problems and challenges at the agency he's not going to be let's throw the baby out with the bathwater." Castro's appointment also would be a win for Democrats looking to add diversity to its national roster of potential candidates and put Texas in play in 2016 as well as help smooth over tensions with Latinos who are frustrated over a lack of an immigration reform overhaul, said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University historian and CNN contributor. "In terms of the Democrats and Obama, it is at least symbolic of the party's commitment to immigration and immigration reform," Zelizer said. "It does elevate his status. It makes him a national figure rather than a local figure." Castro, the son of political activists, is the youngest mayor of a major American city. His meteoric rise from local government to being called upon to take on a Cabinet-level position is a political narrative tailor-made for primetime. He and his twin brother, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, were picked to take the stage at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte. The congressman introduced his brother who in turn gave a keynote address that was memorable for both his young daughter's charming hair flip and his tale of a second-generation, Mexican-American immigrant's successful rise. "My grandmother never owned a house. She cleaned other people's houses so she could afford to rent her own. But she saw her daughter become the first in her family to graduate from college," he said during the 2012 address. "And my mother fought hard for civil rights so that instead of a mop, I could hold this microphone." Mayors' stories out of school Beyond the immigrant son-made-good narrative, Castro brings a "new energy" to the President's second term, said Trey Martinez Fischer, a Democratic Texas state representative who heads that body's Mexican American Legislative Caucus. "It's very important to note is that he brings a fresh perspective and new energy to this President's second term, Fischer said. "He could serve as a pick me up for an administration that's been in place for some time."  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/23/politics/benghazi-kerry-testify/index.html	Kerry agrees to testify on Benghazi attack - CNN.com	2014/05/23	(CNN) -- Secretary of State John Kerry has agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee on the deadly Benghazi terror attack, according to a letter from his office to the panel that was obtained by CNN. Kerry was subpoenaed by Oversight panel Chairman Darrell Issa of California after new emails surfaced that Republicans say support their contention the Obama administration politicized its public response to the September 2012 assault. The attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in eastern Libya killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. It's not clear whether the recent formation of a House Select Committee to investigate Benghazi will impact the Oversight probe. The Republican-led Select Committee is still organizing and hasn't scheduled any hearings. According to the letter to Issa that was copied to top members of the Select Committee as well, the State Department said Kerry could not accommodate the Oversight panel's demand that he appear on May 29 due to scheduling conflicts. However, the letter said Kerry was "prepared to appear" at a later hearing, which the panel has now set for June 12. "The committee looks forward to his appearance," Frederick Hill, a spokesman for the panel, said in a statement. Additionally, the State Department believes that an appearance before Issa's committee next month would "remove any need" for him to testify before the Select Committee to "answer additional questions."

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/22/politics/military-force-authorization/index.html	Setback for ending the 'never-ending' war - CNN.com	2014/05/22	Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration and many of its national security critics agree that it's time to revisit the war authorization that Congress approved a week after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. But when to end it and how to replace it is another matter. The House defeated an amendment by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, that would have "sunsetted" the so-called "never-ending war" a year from now. Attention now turns to the Senate and whether a proposal will emerge there. The law authorized a military response to the terrorist attacks by striking back against al Qaeda and associated forces, including their Taliban allies, who at the time ruled Afghanistan. Its scope is broad enough that it has been used by successive administrations to carry out military attacks as far afield as Africa and Yemen. When to end it is a prickly enough issue that the White House has done little to move ahead with President Barack Obama's promise, as described in a 2013 speech at the National Defense University, to work with Congress to "refine and ultimately repeal" the Authorization for Use of Military Force, or AUMF. As in other national security policy fights -- that of drones, for instance -- the rise of tea party-affiliated libertarians and Obama's sagging popularity have scrambled some of the traditional alliances on the war authorization. Liberals and right-leaning libertarians who criticize the war authorization as too much of a blank check to the President are uniting to support a repeal of it as a way to assert congressional authority. Some conservatives -- who not long ago supported extending the current AUMF -- now suggest replacing it with a law that specifies the groups the U.S. is fighting. "I think we have abdicated our responsibility to define the nature of the conflict we're in," Schiff said in an interview. His amendment appeared to have gained steam, in part because the White House has struggled to make clear what it thinks should happen. At a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing Wednesday, senior lawyers from the Defense and State departments said repealing the law would do no harm to national security or affect military operations, because the President's executive powers allow a military response to any threats to the nation. And yet, they wouldn't say whether the administration supported ending the war now. "We're not here to say it should be repealed today," said Mary Mcleod, deputy legal adviser at the State Department. The issue matters because U.S. forces are exiting a war in Afghanistan that lasted more than twice as long as World War II. Some legal experts believe that development adds some pressure to replace the existing AUMF, in part, because the main al Qaeda forces that attacked the U.S. have been decimated, even as new offshoots have metastasized the terrorist threat to parts of Africa, Syria and the Arabian Peninsula. Michael Mukasey, attorney general under President George W. Bush, said at the Wednesday hearing that he supports the idea of Congress revisiting the authorization to clarify its intent. Harold Koh, the State Department's top lawyer under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, said the law should be narrowed and eventually repealed. Administration officials say part of the complication lies in ongoing negotiations with Afghanistan over whether the United States will retain forces in that country after this year, a deal that can't be reached until after Afghanistan elects a new president in June. "As we work with the government of Afghanistan to identify an appropriate U.S. military presence in Afghanistan after 2014; as we continue to make progress towards the closure of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay; and as we continue to work with our friends and partners around the world to provide assistance and training to counter al Qaeda and its associated forces, we will engage further with Congress and the American people on efforts to ensure that the legal authorities for our counterterrorism and detention operations are appropriately tailored," said Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the National Security Council. "In keeping with our ongoing efforts to realign our forces and capabilities after the drawdown in Afghanistan, we look forward to engaging the Congress on the President's goal of refining and ultimately repealing the AUMF," she added. Only three years ago, Congress was being pressured to expand the authorization. In 2011, Rep. Buck McKeon, R-California, tried to pass a new AUMF to reaffirm the war against al Qaeda and to try to restrict the President's hand on issues such as the plan to close the Guantanamo prison. McKeon's push to give the existing war authorization more life has partly influenced the Obama administration's effort on the issue. Two administration officials told CNN that part of the reason for the White House's hesitation is the fear that some congressional hawks would use the opportunity to expand the so-called War on Terror. Or that the administration could end up without any authorization at all. In his State of the Union speeches this year and last, Obama said he aimed to pull the United States back from its "permanent war footing." Some congressional critics say Obama's policies appear to prematurely declare victory over al Qaeda's core leadership, and ignore the growing threat from affiliates such as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and groups fighting in Syria, Iraq and Libya. With partisan bickering sowing gridlock in Congress, passing any law on the war authorization is a tall order. Congress is also debating surveillance law changes in the wake of the leaks about the U.S. government's spying activities by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Schiff scoffs at the notion it's too hard to tackle. "We drafted the AUMF in days after 9/11; we should be able to do this in a year," he said. After all, "one of the most important things that Congress does is to declare war and define the focus of that war."
