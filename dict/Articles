(CNN) -- A powerful reaction to women-hater Elliot Rodger's killing rampage Friday night has been the Twitter hashtag #YesAllWomen, where women point out how misogyny and sexism damage them and restrict their lives. It emerged in response to the common, misguided argument that "not all men" are like that. Of course not all men are like Elliot Rodger. But he is the product of a culture that condones and in many cases endorses the belief that if you are a "nice guy" -- or a "supreme gentleman" as Rodger described himself -- you are somehow entitled to sex with women. Gun control, campus safety and mental illness are all issues raised by the massacre, but hatred of women concerns me most. I am the founder of The UnSlut Project, which fights "slut shaming" and sexual bullying in our schools and communities. I'm also a graduate student at University of California, Santa Barbara, where the rampage took place. Why #YesAllWomen took off on Twitter Rodger and others like him believe that sex is a reward to be earned, not a consensual activity between adults who respect each other, and that women are prizes to be won, not actual people with the agency to make decisions about their own bodies. Nowhere is this mindset more obvious than in the reactions of some men who actually sympathize with Rodger. Many of these men are self-described Pick-Up Artists, or PUAs, who employ a series of strict rules in order to manipulate women into having sex with them, referring to those women as their "targets." Rodger allegedly participated in forums on the site PUAHate, which criticizes Pick-Up Artists not because of their obviously misogynist tactics, but because those tactics didn't work for him and other PUAHate members. The site shut down Saturday morning with the message: "PUAHate is about to get a massive amount of press," according to the watchdog Southern Poverty Law Center. After the killings, the extent of misogyny in this community was revealed in the creation of a Facebook page called "Elliot Rodger Is an American Hero," with the advice for everyone to "share your thoughts and pay your respects to Elliot Rodger here. Also, view this final message from our beloved hero," which links to his videotaped rant, with commenters expressing solidarity with his desire for revenge against women. The page has since been taken down. The creator of the popular PUA site "Return of Kings" -- where "women and homosexuals are prohibited from commenting" -- claimed, "More people will die unless you give men sexual options." "Manosphere" sites like Return of Kings admire "alpha males," disparage "beta males," and promote hypermasculinity. But again, most men are not members of these hate communities and not all men hold similar beliefs. That's not the point. These views are just extreme versions of very common, socially acceptable ideas about women and sex. Rodger was undoubtedly mentally unstable, but some of the sexist ideas in his manifesto are, unfortunately, not the invention of a madman. They're the norm. This is the first time I have publicly identified myself as a graduate student at UCSB. I founded The UnSlut Project by blogging my own middle school diary, so I use a pen name and guard my identity in order to protect people I mentioned in those diary entries. But in the wake of this crisis, I want to speak out. The university has responded in an admirable way: setting up a 24-hour call center and extensive counseling options to help students cope, establishing the U.C .Santa Barbara Community Fund to honor the victims, and organizing campuswide memorial events. Opinion: Shooter's rage at women too familiar in America As the details of Rodger's history and the crime itself continue to emerge, we will have a better idea of the institutional steps that could have been taken to prevent it. We will write letters to our representatives and use our votes to speak up about what we believe should be done to prevent future tragedies. But in the meantime, on a personal level, we need to take responsibility for our own reactions to this story. We teach our children from a young age that a girl's value as a human being is inextricably linked to her sexual behavior. Her virginity is something to be "given up" or even "lost." Sex with her is a prize to be won -- and she herself is equated with that "prize." In stark contrast, boys are taught that their virginity is something to be ashamed of. Their masculinity depends on sexual prowess and physical dominance. It is from this understanding that the PUA movement arises, populated by boys and men who feel worthless because they don't have sex. Their anger is directed at the women -- the "prizes" -- who refuse to "give" them what they feel they deserve. So where do we go from here? Although it brought to light the various struggles of women across the country, #YesAllWomen is, ultimately, just a hashtag. It will stop trending. When it does, let's continue the conversation outside the realm of social media. Tuesday afternoon, I will join the rest of the UCSB community at a memorial service for Rodger's victims. As we mourn Katherine Cooper, Christopher Martinez, Veronika Weiss, Weihan Wang, George Chen, and Cheng Yuan Hong, conversations will focus on their lives, personalities, and accomplishments. But as we move forward and try to make sense of what happened, it's our responsibility to start productive, respectful conversations about the misogyny behind Rodger's actions. Instead of avoiding talking about sex, let's start age-appropriate conversations with our children about consent and respect. Let's speak up when a man in our group of friends speaks disrespectfully about a woman he's had sex with. And most important, let's analyze our own assumptions about what sex means with regard to different genders. Most men are not killers like Elliot Rodger. Most men don't sympathize with his motives. But all of us, regardless of gender, can contribute to changing the misogynist culture that inspired him. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.

A former CNN producer and correspondent, she is the author of "The End of Revolution: A Changing World in the Age of Live Television." Follow her on Twitter @FridaGhitis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.  (CNN) -- How is it possible that America has not managed to come together and build an effective response to gun massacres? How can that be? If another country had sent a killer who massacred people at random in the streets of an American city, Congress would have rushed to emergency session and the public would have thrown its support behind forceful action. Politicians, news media, community groups, everyone would be working in solidarity to combat the evil facing the nation. Just imagine if it happened again and again. In Isla Vista, California, a mass killing has shaken the nation. But every time we hear of another gunman's rampage, Americans go straight into their comfort zone. For a few days, advocates of gun rights stiffen their spines and vehemently defend their turf. On the other side, gun control advocates brandish their arguments while relatives of the latest victims cry out in pain and despair. The discussion combusts and burns itself off with the usual ingredients: Is the problem too many guns? Is it mental health? Is it guns in the hands of the wrong people? Yes, yes, yes to all of the above. Each killing spree triggers other discussions. Is it hatred for women, a breakdown of societal norms, too many video games, violence in movies? By all means we should study, debate and analyze the many factors that contribute to violence. But first, it's time to take the urgent action needed to stanch the bleeding, to at least slow the hemorrhage. Opinion: I'm a gun owner and I want gun control How can a country become accustomed to the idea that children may go to school one morning and never come home? It happens over and over and over again. How can it become routine that anyone, anywhere, for no reason at all, can get killed by a mentally disturbed person? At times, the entire country's response to the endless stream of killings resembles the embarrassing stagnation of politicians in Washington. Each side self-righteously preaches, firing up its own supporters, and nothing changes. Politicians, by the way, have become useless in tackling the crisis. Talking about guns is too risky. In 1999, when two killers massacred more than a dozen, mostly teenagers, at Columbine High School, the entire world was in shock. Since then, the shootings have kept coming. At Virginia Tech campus, 32 people were killed. In Aurora, Colorado, 12 people were shot dead, 70 were injured. At Sandy Hook Elementary School, 20 children and six staff members were killed. At a parking lot in Tuscon, Arizona, a congresswoman was shot in the head. Luckily, she survived, but others nearby were killed. There are two common denominators: guns and mental illness. Can Americans set aside their differences and try to work out an agreement that will address this crisis? Can the two sides recognize the sorrow and pain that are spreading as they shout past one another? Gun enthusiasts don't support mass murder. Nobody does. That's the fundamental common ground. Can we have a moment to set aside strategic long-term political objectives -- just a brief interlude -- and work together to try to prevent more people with mental illness from arming themselves and killing the innocent? Here's what I suggest. Might the NRA, with all its political power, announce it is willing to speak with mental health specialists, law enforcement officials and gun control advocates to focus sharply on just this issue? Hold a summit, form a high-level committee, take the first step on the road to a solution. Consider a few recent killing sprees. The Sandy Hook killer had serious mental health issues. The man who shot Rep. Gabby Giffords had dropped out of school after his college required a mental health evaluation. The Virginia Tech killer had been investigated by the university for stalking and had been declared mentally ill by a Virginia special justice. The Isla Vista shooter also had a history of mental illness. Like many others mass shooters, he had given clear signs that he was extremely dangerous, planning to kill. He had had several encounters with police. His family had alerted the police to the danger. Still, like all the other mass shooters before him, he was able to build an arsenal as he planned his rampage. Things must change. The threshold for taking someone against their will for psychiatric evaluation needs to be lowered. Police need better mental health training. It must become easier to intervene when there are risks. Importantly, people who have mental illnesses that put them at risk of violence should be blocked from owning weapons. Does anyone, even the most avid hunter, the most passionate gun enthusiast, think mentally ill people should be allowed to own semi-automatic weapons, or any weapons at all, for that matter? Opinion: Let teens talk about mental illness Beyond the area of mental health, there is much to be debated about whether a free society requires that its citizens be allowed to arm themselves so thoroughly, and whether an armed population makes for more or less crime. The United States can learn from the experience of other countries where people maintain wide-ranging rights to carry weapons, but have taken measures that effectively brought an end to gun massacres. Everyone is at risk now, people in every ZIP code, in every income level, of every race. A loved one could die in a random shooting out on the street or in a temple or a movie theater; in a country club, or on a college campus. No one can honestly deny that it is a real crisis. America can take steps to start fixing this problem. Gun lovers and gun control advocates can come together and craft a solution. Show Washington that it can be done. Show the world that America has the power to solve an urgent problem. Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/politics/phoenix-va-hospital/index.html	politics	Troubling report issued on VA; McCain says Shinseki should go - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 01:17:08 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- An initial review of the Veterans Affairs medical facility in Phoenix has found multiple unofficial wait lists of veterans seeking care and 1,700 veterans not on any list but also waiting to be seen, according to an agency watchdog. The preliminary report submitted to senior VA officials and to Congress by Richard Griffin, the agency's acting inspector general, is the first independent word since lawmakers and the White House demanded answers this month on the controversy over allegations of delayed care nationwide. The report also found "numerous allegations" of "daily of mismanagement, inappropriate hiring decisions, sexual harassment, and bullying behavior by mid- and senior-level managers" at the Phoenix facility. But the inspector general's report does not make any broader conclusions on whether delays in scheduling affected treatment, and the investigation continues. The VA is under fire over allegations of alarming shortcomings at medical facilities nationwide. The controversy, as CNN first reported, involves of delayed care with potential fatal consequences in possibly dozens of cases. CNN has reported that in Phoenix, the VA used fraudulent record-keeping -- including an alleged secret list -- that covered up excessive waiting periods for veterans, some of whom died in the process. Overall, the number of VA facilities under investigation has expanded to 26, the inspector general's office said Tuesday. Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that Griffin's initial findings were terrible and said it was "about time" the Justice Department launched its own investigation. He also said embattled VA Secretary Eric Shinseki should probably resign, which the Cabinet officer has said he has no plans to do. "I haven't said this before, but I think it's time for General Shinseki to move on," McCain said. There have been calls from other members of Congress for him to step down over the scandal, but McCain's voice on military issues carries enormous weight considering his experience as a combat veteran and a Vietnam prisoner of war.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/world/canada-kidnapped-baby-facebook/index.html	world	Kidnapped newborn baby found 'thanks to Facebook' - CNN.com	2014/05/27	Tuesday May 27 08:50:39 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- The woman wore a nurse's uniform when she walked into the maternity ward. She left the hospital driving away in a red car with a sign that said "Baby on Board." Police say there was a baby inside the Toyota Yaris the 21-year-old was driving Monday evening as she left the hospital in Trois-Rivires, Quebec. But the little girl wasn't hers. At the hospital, baby Victoria's parents were frantic. Their child was only 16 hours old when she was abducted, mother Mlissa McMahon said in a Facebook post describing the ordeal. "The worst case scenarios played out over and over in our heads," she wrote. "Unfortunately, the endings are not often happy, above all in this type of case." But just a few hours after the baby went missing, authorities returned her to her parents. Thanks to "four marvelous people," McMahon wrote, and "thanks to Facebook." "It is the only reason that explains why Victoria is in my arms at this time," she said. Amber Alert goes viral Publicity about Victoria's disappearance started with an Amber Alert sent out by Quebec police. In social media posts, messages from police described the vehicle and the woman driving it. The newborn, police said, was wrapped in a blue blanket. It wasn't long before the alert and a photo went viral. A group of four friends spotted it on Facebook when they were hanging out on Monday night, Canadian media reported. "We just wanted to do something for the night, so we went out to find the car," Charlne Plante told Canada's CTV network When police released a photo of a woman wearing scrubs in the hospital, Plante said she immediately recognized her former neighbor. The friends drove to the woman's apartment and saw the car parked outside. "The patio door was open. The lights were on," Mlizanne Bergeron told Canadian public broadcaster CBC. "It was clear that she was there." Then, they called police. Officers were there within minutes, Plante said, kicking down the apartment door. The baby was recovered and a woman was taken into custody. "After the baby was in the hands of the police, it was the best moment in my life," Bergeron told CTV. "We were crying." On Facebook, she posted a video showing her tearful friends as a police officer appeared in the apartment building's stairwell, the baby safe in his arms. Woman in custody Quebec police spokeswoman Christine Coulombe wouldn't confirm details about how the baby was found, but she said police received tips from the public after publicizing the case on social media. The woman was hospitalized for evaluation and was on 24-hour police watch, but she had not met yet with investigators Tuesday, Coulombe said. It is not known whether there was any previous link between the woman and the baby's family, she said. In a statement, the hospital from where the baby was taken thanked police investigators and said a team of risk-assessment experts would be analyzing the circumstances surrounding the incident and making recommendations about whether any changes are needed. Details from the police investigation will also be part of that analysis, the hospital said. "At this time, it is difficult to discuss in more detail the situation without revealing specific elements that could harm the investigation and court proceedings," the Center for Health and Social Services of Trois-Rivires said in a statement. "The establishment will therefore be reserved in public statements in the coming days." Daniel Cossette, the baby's uncle, told CTV that he spoke with the woman in the nurse's uniform as she walked down the hospital hallway with the newborn in her arms. She told him she was taking the baby for routine tests. "She had the attitude, the uniform, all of it," he said, "and we never presumed she was a kidnapper." 'Every click, every share made the difference' As authorities continue investigating, the baby's mother says she has no doubt about how Victoria ended up in her arms again. Alert hospital staff realized quickly that the baby had been taken, she said. Fellow patients at the hospital provided details about the woman and her vehicle. Security guards tracked down a photo of the woman with help from police. And investigators sent out the Amber Alert and image very quickly. "The photo saved our daughter! In less than an hour, the photo was everywhere...You were more than thousands of people who shared the photo of this woman on social media. ... Know that it was this that saved her, our little Victoria. Every click, every share made the difference," McMahon wrote in a message thanking people for their support. But along with her thank-you message, she also sent a word of caution to other mothers, saying that her experience with the woman dressed as a nurse should be a warning. "Never allow yourself to be influenced by a uniform....I know that it can seem trivial, but if I had been more skeptical, all of this could have been avoided....Verify the badge of the nurse...ask questions...it is your child, don't let them out of your sight," she wrote. "I would not like anyone else to live this." She did not describe further details about any interaction with the woman. As for her baby, McMahon said "little Victoria wears her name well for this victory." "To give life to our child is an incredible moment," she wrote, "but finding our child safe and sound is an indescribable feeling." Her post had been shared more than 18,000 times on Facebook by Tuesday night. How to guard against baby snatchers Woman who kidnapped baby 25 years ago sentenced to 12 years in prison  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/us/mexico-marine/index.html	us	U.S. Marine held in Mexico prison scheduled for court Wednesday - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 10:58:30 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- A U.S. Marine and Afghanistan war veteran held in a Mexico prison for nearly two months will make appearance in court Wednesday, his mother told CNN's "New Day." Jill Tahmooressi said her son, Marine Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi, accidentally crossed into Mexico with three personal firearms -- all bought legally in the U.S. The 25-year-old had intended to drive to meet friends in San Ysidro, California, on March 31, and was moving from Florida to California in the hope of settling, getting a job and continuing treatment he had just begun for post traumatic stress related to his two combat tours. With all his possessions in his truck, Tahmooressi drove across the border. When he realized his mistake, his mother said, he dialed 911 and asked the operator to help him. No help came, Jill Tahmooressi said. Her son first encountered Mexican customs agents, she said, and he believed they understood that he'd made an innocent error. They seemed to be getting an escort car to help him, she said. But the officers with the Mexican military interfered, she told "New Day," and her son was arrested. "He is relieved that he'll be able to go before the judge and explain precisely how he made that accidental wrong turn and ended up in the dilemma that he's in right now," she said. Andrew Tahmooressi was initially held at La Mesa penitentiary in Tijuana, Mexico, facing a weapons charge, according to the Mexican attorney general's office. In early May, the office told CNN that the Marine's scheduled court date was Wednesday. Twenty-one days ago he was moved from La Mesa to El Tongo prison in the state of Baja California, Jill Tahmooressi said. He is being held is isolation -- away from the general population of the lock-up -- and is constantly watched by a guard, she said. The Marine has tried to appeal to U.S. lawmakers. "I accidentally drove into Mexico with 3 guns ... a rifle (AR-15), a .45 cal pistol and a 12 gauge pump shotgun with no intensions (sic) on being in Mexico or being involved in any criminal activities," Andrew Tahmooressi wrote in a statement of innocence to U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee. "I have rights to all 3 weapons," he wrote. "They are under my name. ... Please help me." Hunter is among several lawmakers who have petitioned for Tahmooressi's release. Also, in a bipartisan congressional letter addressed to Mexico's attorney general on May 8, Hunter wrote: "Mexico's Attorney General is in a position to deal with Andrew's case and ensure its quick resolution. ... It is necessary that the AG intervene and expedite proceedings at the very least. And so far there's been no validation from Mexico that Andrew didn't make a directional mistake at the border." U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said he spoke with Mexican authorities last week about the case. "We are working on determining whether or not certain evidence that has been presented is meeting the standard that's necessary to be able to hold that young Marine, and we're trying to find out exactly what the fact pattern is, but we are working on that," he told Jake Tapper on CNN's "New Day"  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/health/return-white-plague-incurable-tb/index.html	health	Return of the 'White Plague': Fears over the rise of 'incurable' TB - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 06:17:06 EDT 2014	Vital Signs is a monthly program bringing viewers health stories from around the world. (CNN) -- "Sometimes I ask myself, why me? Why did this have to happen again?" says 31-year-old Andile from the Khayelitsha township in Cape Town, South Africa. "But the problem is I could have got it anywhere, on the bus, in a taxi, in my work. It's everywhere." Andile has extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), a form of the airborne disease that is resistant to the four main groups of drugs used to treat it, meaning treatment can take years and requires alternative drugs that have more side effects. He's had tuberculosis for more than two years but it's not the first time he's been infected. "Where I stay, the environment is not right, it's not clean. I could have got TB there, or on the taxis we use as they never open the windows," he says. TB has long been known as a disease of poverty. Dense housing, shared living space, poor ventilation, poor nutrition and poor healthcare systems are the prime conditions for the infection to spread, and thrive. This ancient disease was known as the "White Plague" in 18th century Europe and still kills more than one million people a year globally. It's a complicated disease with the potential to affect many parts of the body and it can remain latent in people for many years, leaving them unaware they are infected. The main active form of the disease affects the lungs; if left untreated it can cause considerable lung damage, resulting in eventual death. 'Public health emergency' After repeated exposure, Andile has extensive damage to his lungs, leaving him reliant on an oxygen tank as he receives his treatment from Medecin Sans Frontiers. The NGO plays a large role in treating TB in Khayelitsha, one of the largest townships in the country. Andile is one of thousands of people who contract the extensively drug-resistant form each year and he makes a crucial point -- TB is everywhere in South Africa and is the leading cause of death. It's estimated that up to 80% of drug-resistant forms of the disease are now transmitted directly between people, rather than developing over time. "The disease has reached a public health emergency in South Africa," explains Keertan Dheda, professor of medicine at the University of Cape Town. "We treat half a million cases a year and today, the epidemic has taken a turn with drug resistance. We treat 8,000 cases of resistance a year and now a chunk of those have developed resistance beyond XDR-TB -- incurable TB." Read: Hunting down 'fiery serpent' disease Looking at the disease globally, in 2013 there were 72 cases of drug-resistant TB in the United States. In 2012 there were 64,000 cases in India and 59,000 in China. The more people and the closer their proximity, the easier the disease spreads. Drug resistance can develop for a variety of reasons. For TB, the origins lie in incomplete treatment regimens where people did not complete their course of antibiotics due either to poor health systems or personal preference or complacency. Incomplete treatments mean the bacteria behind the disease -- Mycobacterium tuberculosis -- have had some, but not full, exposure to the drugs prescribed to kill them, giving them the opportunity to mutate and become resistant. The result today is such vast resistance that in some settings, all known drugs have been rendered useless and these forms are now transmitting between people. "We now have patients who are therapeutically destitute," explains Dheda. Global problem The problem is now global. XDR-TB has its highest prevalence in Russian, Eastern Europe, China and India, with the latter reporting cases of total drug resistance. But according to the 2013 Global TB report from the World Health Organization (WHO), this extensive form of resistant TB has been reported in 92 countries, and is likely to be in more. "It's probably in every country," says David Heymann, head of the Center on Global Health Security at think tank Chatham House and chair of the Health Protection Agency in the United Kingdom. "The disease has spread internationally and is a real concern." The 67th World Health Assembly took place last week and it approved a long-term global TB strategy, including targets to reduce TB deaths by 95% between 2015 and 2035. Also firmly on the agenda was the global concern of antibiotic resistance and the fear of many diseases becoming untreatable. The issue has been addressed by many public health organizations in 2014 and Heymann believes TB is a prime example of the problem and should be declared a public health emergency of international concern by the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee. But such a declaration is yet to be made. Read: This machine makes drinking water from thin air The man in charge of the controlling the problem globally is Mario Raviglione, director of the Global Tuberculosis Program at the WHO. "TB is competing with HIV/AIDS as the number one killer among the infectious diseases," explains Raviglione. "There are about 450,000 new drug-resistant TB cases every year and this is the scariest part of tuberculosis as you are left with less options to treat people, many of which are toxic." 'Extraordinary measures' Raviglione stresses that the epidemic may differ in different parts of the world but is very much an international issue. "Russia, India, China and South Africa have about 60% of the world cases, so if they don't improve there is no way the world can progress," he says. Raviglione is especially concerned about the increased rates of drug-resistant TB seen in Southern Africa. "This scares us most because in that part of the world there is a lot of HIV and so it can become explosive and really spread and move fast as HIV amplifies the effect of tuberculosis." The ability of HIV to suppress human immune systems enables TB bacteria to take over the body. The WHO strategy therefore is to target high-burden countries and improve the diagnosis and treatment of drug-resistant TB. Because patients must take drugs for at least two years, getting them to stick with the treatment is essential, and transmission must also be controlled. Not a simple feat. "This threat has to be prevented and when it does occur, extraordinary measures must be put in place to diagnose and treat to stop it spreading to others," states Raviglione. "It's a real threat and has to be taken extremely seriously."

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/world/asia/malaysia-missing-plane/index.html	world	Underwater search for MH370 postponed for at least 2 months - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 05:03:55 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- After two grueling months with no word from their loved ones, relatives of those on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 will have to wait two more months before the search resumes underwater. The Bluefin-21 drone is completing its final mission in the Indian Ocean on Wednesday, marking the end of the underwater hunt -- for now. With no tangible evidence found by the drone, which costs an estimated $40,000 a day to operate, search officials are regrouping and preparing to deploy more high-tech equipment. Only a handful of companies have such devices, which will likely include towed sonar, an autonomous underwater vehicle with mounted sonar and optical imaging equipment, Australian officials said. Soliciting those companies and negotiating contracts will take time, and officials have said they want a single private contractor to lead the next stage of the search. That phase, which aims to scour 60,000 square kilometers, probably won't start for at least two months. The cost? About $60 million. Uncharted territory In the meantime, China is using a specialized ship to map the ocean floor in a remote part of the Indian Ocean -- something that's never been done before. While the Bluefin-21 can provide greater resolution than deep-towed sonar devices, the drone could only go about 4.5 kilometers deep. It's unclear how deep the water is in the expanded search area because "it's never been mapped," Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said earlier this month. China's Zhu Kezhen ship will be joined by a contracted commercial survey vessel in June, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said. While 26 countries have participated in the hunt for the missing plane, Malaysia, China and Australia have held high-level talks about the future of the search. Malaysia is where the the plane is from, China had more than 100 passengers on board, and Australia had six passengers on board and is close to the stretch of the Indian Ocean where searchers have focused their hunt. Australia has estimated the next phase of the search will cost $60 million, with the breakdown of exactly who's going to pay for what yet to be determined. Satellite data released  With the underwater search on hiatus, analysts are combing through a 47-page document containing hundreds of lines of communication logs between the plane and the British company Inmarsat's satellite system. Relatives of passengers have been clamoring for the release of satellite data for months. It was the satellite data, along with other information, that led officials to zero in on a search area in the southern Indian ocean. And some families suspect officials may be searching in the wrong spot. But the document released Tuesday doesn't provide the whole picture. It's "intended to provide a readable summary of the data communication logs," notes at the beginning of the document say. Some passengers' families, unsatisfied by the official explanation of the plane's fate, say they want an independent analysis of the complex information -- a process that could take weeks. CNN safety analyst David Soucie said certain key elements, which would allow independent experts to fully test the official conclusion, are missing from the data in the document. "There's not enough information to say whether they made an error," he said. "I think we're still going to be looking for more." Inmarsat CEO Rupert Pearce acknowledged Tuesday that the company didn't release the model to which it applied the data to estimate the plane's path -- and said the decision on whether to release the model lies with the Malaysian government, which is leading the search. "We'd be perfectly happy to put that model out," Pearce told CNN's "New Day." But Pearce also said the publicized data, along with engine and radar data, are enough for experienced third parties to plug into their own models and reach their own conclusions. Sarah Bajc, whose partner, Philip Wood, was on the missing jet, said she was "annoyed" that Inmarsat and Malaysian authorities hadn't released everything they used to reach their conclusions. "I see no reason for them to have massaged this before giving it to us," she said. Regardless of what information has been released, two pressing questions remain -- where is the plane, and what went wrong? Is Inmarsat right? Did Inmarsat data point Flight 370 searchers in wrong direction? CNN's Saima Mohsin, Jethro Mullen, Mitra Mobasherat and Catherine Shoichet contributed to this report.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/living/california-killer-hashtag-yesallwomen/index.html	living	Killer Elliot Rodger's rants inspired #YesAllWomen tweets - CNN.com	2014/05/27	Tuesday May 27 12:18:13 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- No, not all men channel frustration over romantic rejection into a killing spree. But yes, all women experience harassment, discrimination or worse at some point in their lives. That's the message at the core of an ongoing Twitter conversation that emerged after a rampage last week that left six students from the University of California, Santa Barbara, dead and wounded 13 others. Elliot Rodger, who apparently shot and killed himself, left behind a robust digital footprint detailing his plan to "destroy everything I cannot have," blaming the "cruelness of women" for leading to his "day of retribution." His comments inspired Twitter users to tweet the hashtag #YesAllWomen: They shared examples of what "women must fear" even if "not all men" engage in those behaviors, according to the person believed to have created the hashtag Saturday. The person did not respond to CNN's request for comment. #notallmen practice violence against women but #YesAllWomen live with the threat of male violence. Every. Single. Day. All over the world. The hashtag -- a response to the "not all men" defense sometimes used to deflect feminist arguments -- spread quickly on Twitter, zeroing in on the subtle and explicit signals that a woman's worth is based on her availability to men. By Tuesday morning, #YesAllWomen had been tweeted more than 1 million times. Because I now wear shorts under dresses in crowded bars after being groped and even penetrated by unseen hands. #YesAllWomen Because calling me "Darlin' " in our first business meeting is "okay" because you're from the South. #YesAllWomen #YesAllWomen b/c not returning someone's feelings, or as society calls it putting them in the "friend zone", should not make me feel guilty Expanding the conversation #YesAllWomen is the latest Twitter hashtag to draw attention to violence against women in a global conversation that has spread from social media to college campuses and into the White House. While most feminist-driven Twitter campaigns preach to the choir, #YesAllWomen has succeeded in drawing the mainstream -- including men -- into the conversation, feminist writer and political analyst Zerlina Maxwell said. More unique is the conversation's focus on misogyny and its negative impact on women and men, Maxwell said, pointing to tweets from men as evidence. Don't hate the #yesallwomen hashtag. Hate that it has to even exist. Hate the injustice of gender inequality. Hate violence against women. There was backlash to the hashtag's sentiment, too. Some challenged the idea that misogyny was behind Rodger's killing spree, while others argued against the broader idea that most women face gender-based harassment. But those tweeting #YesAllWomen interpreted backlash as evidence to prove their points. Sigh. Because I'm still having to use the block button for hateful messages. #YesAllWomen #YesAllWomen's forebears include #everydaysexism, which evolved from the website Everyday Sexism. In 2011, the site launched as a place for people to share stories of gender-based harassment. Today, #everdaysexism exists as a continuous feed of examples of street harassment, and as an occasional rallying cry around petitions. It has been tweeted more than 520,000 times in the past year, according to social Web search engine Topsy. Earlier this year, Maxwell started #rapecultureiswhen in response to a Time.com op-ed calling for an end to "rape culture hysteria." The hashtag highlighted examples of victim blaming and was tweeted more than 67,000 times. With more than 1.2 million tweets so far, #YesAllWomen has far outpaced both hashtags, according to Topsy. It has drawn comments from celebrities such as Kerry Washington, Neil Gaiman and Patton Oswalt. Celebrity boost aside, #YesAllWomen's universal appeal springs from "bottom-up" personal stories instead of a single omniscient voice in an op-ed, Maxwell said. "It's not somebody on high saying this is a problem in society and everyone should fix it," she said. "It's people talking about real experiences, and each experience is validated by the next." More than Internet slacktivism Even though #YesAllWomen grew as a counterpoint to the "not all men" argument, it's effective because it stands on its own, feminist media critic Rachel Sklar said. In fact, Rodger's killing spree shows that men can also be victims of hostility toward women: Four men were among those killed, including his two roommates, "the biggest nerds I had ever seen," Rodger said. Rodger left behind a 137-page "manifesto" in which he wrote, "I've wanted love, affection, adoration. You think I'm unworthy of it. That's a crime that can never be forgiven." "I don't know what you don't see in me. I'm the perfect guy and yet you throw yourselves at these obnoxious men instead of me, the supreme gentleman," Rodger said in a YouTube video posted the day of the killings. Sklar said his words echoed sentiments voiced by men's rights activists in online forums and social media platforms, especially Twitter. Those murmurs rarely turn deadly, she said, but Rodger's actions represent every woman's worst fears. "It's been a collective trigger for women. It's an extreme case of something we see and experience regularly as part of our lives, but it's shocking and jarring and scary to see it taken to these lengths," said Sklar, who founded the women's network TheLi.st. Despite its grim origins, #YesAllWomen advanced conversation around issues that dominate feminist circles, feminist writer Soraya Chemaly said. The hashtag sparked more discussion about rape in India and Africa, and college campus sex assault in the United States. The hashtag also forced discussion of the intersection of mental illness and misogyny in violence against women, especially in mass shootings, which are overwhelmingly perpetrated by white men. "I don't know how anyone can look at this information and not see how densely matrixed all these factors and events are," Chemaly said. "We keep seeing this pattern repeated and people seem to think misogyny or mental illness are exclusive or need to be prioritized." While there's no tangible outcome to the hashtag's spread, those involved said it's far from the typical slacktivism. It created a virtual space for women to share their stories, Chemaly said. "While there's a lot of harm that can happen online, the Internet (has been) so fundamentally transformative for women and feminists," she said. "Women who were isolated in their experiences by culture and their families for the first time can exceed those boundaries."  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/us/nba-clippers-sterling/index.html	us	Source: Shelly Sterling 'moving quickly' to sell L.A. Clippers - CNN.com	2014/05/27	Tuesday May 27 11:50:19 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Los Angeles Clippers co-owner Shelly Sterling is "moving quickly" to sell the embattled NBA franchise, with a source familiar with the situation saying she and her representatives would like to make a deal this week. The recent activity includes talks with several high-profile potential suitors for the team, and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver is "very much involved" in Shelly Sterling's dealings with potential buyers, according to the source. But as bidders make their pitches for his team, Donald Sterling -- Shelly's estranged husband and the team's other owner -- accused the NBA of violating his constitutional rights in trying to end his ownership of the franchise based on what he says was an illegally recorded conversation during a lovers' quarrel, according to a document posted online by USA Today. The document, Sterling's apparent 26-page response to charges of violating the league's bylaws, adhered to the NBA's Tuesday deadline for the billionaire businessman's reply. The NBA has said the next step will be a special Board of Governors meeting on June 3, where the league's 30 ownership groups -- someone else will represent the Clippers -- will meet to hear evidence on Donald Sterling's behavior then vote on terminating the Sterlings' ownership rights. Sterling has been prejudged and won't get a fair hearing, the document says, citing comments from 10 other teams. About one month ago, Silver banned Donald Sterling from NBA facilities and functions and ordered him to pay a record fine after racist remarks by the Clippers' owner to his former companion V. Stiviano surfaced online. A source close to the situation said roughly two weeks ago that Donald Sterling -- who repeatedly denied he's a racist in a CNN interview -- wouldn't pay the fine, would reject the ban and might sue the NBA. The document says Sterling faces a never-before-issued and unjust punishment. "In reality, Mr. Sterling is being banned for life, fined $2.5 million, and stripped of his ownership rights for a purely private conversation with his lover that he did not know was being recorded and that he never intended to see the light of day," the document posted on USA Today says. Other NBA figures have made bigoted or racially insensitive remarks and weren't punished as harshly, Sterling argues. His remarks were made in the heat of an argument, and while they were not justified, they were not meant to harm the NBA, the response says. And while Sterling's remarks were viewed as racist, he says in his response that he was "instrumental in fostering the diverse body of players, coaches, general managers, employees and fans on which the NBA prides itself." The document also says Sterling was active in the African-American community and that there was only one court case -- which he won -- of discrimination brought against him as owner of the Clippers in more than 30 years. Sterling asks that the NBA's charges be denied and that his ownership rights not be terminated. The NBA acknowledged receiving a response from Sterling and reaffirmed the June 3 meeting, saying it will start at 1 p.m. ET to "hear and vote upon this matter." Donald Sterling's attorney, Maxwell Blecher, had no comment. Stiviano has said Sterling knew she was recording him and that the two were never intimate. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said it appeared the Sterlings were taking a two-track strategy. By filing the document, Donald Sterling is protecting his legal options but at the same time he realizes selling the team is the most likely outcome. "I don't think it's a winning argument, but it is a very impressive document," Toobin said. Possible bidders CNN's source on the potential sale said it was a busy Memorial Day weekend for Shelly Sterling. The source indicated she met Sunday with a group led by former NBA star Grant Hill to discuss the sale of the Clippers. In addition, the source familiar with the situation said she met over the weekend at her Malibu, California, home with ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, who made an aggressive offer for the franchise. Shelly Sterling is interested in fielding offers from billionaire businessman Patrick Soon-Shiong, Hill's group, entertainment mogul David Geffen and Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and entrepreneur Magic Johnson and his Guggenheim partners, who two years ago teamed up to buy baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers. Johnson has been at the center of the story from the outset because of controversial banter between 80-year-old Donald Sterling and Stiviano. After TMZ first reported those comments, Donald Sterling lashed out at Johnson in a CNN interview, questioning whether someone who contracted HIV should be considered a role model and asking rhetorically "what has he done" for the African-American community. Johnson called the whole situation sad in his own interview with CNN, in which he urged Sterling to sell the team. The former Los Angeles Laker said if that happens -- and if his Guggenheim partners are interested -- "We'll make a run for it." One person who apparently won't be the NBA franchise's next owner is media tycoon Oprah Winfrey. Despite much buzz in recent weeks, the source familiar with the situation says that Winfrey is "out of the running." The same source said Shelly Sterling will accept offers this week for the Clippers. Shelly Sterling's attorney, Pierce O'Donnell, said no formal offers have been made for the team, which has risen in recent years from a last-place laughingstock to a playoff team with two superstars in forward Blake Griffin and guard Chris Paul. "Shelly and the NBA are working cooperatively on the transaction," O'Donnell said. The Sterlings have been publicly defiant since the story broke, challenging the NBA and its right to force the Clippers' sale. But late last week the Sterlings agreed that Shelly would try to sell the NBA franchise voluntarily even as the league prepares a vote on terminating their franchise rights. The couple own the team through a trust. Shelly Sterling previously had said she wanted to own at least part of the franchise, but doesn't want to be a controlling partner. But if it sold -- likely for between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, according to the well-placed source -- the NBA doesn't want either Sterling to have any ownership stake. Still, they could take solace in the dizzying profit they'd make from such a deal; Donald Sterling reportedly bought the franchise in 1981 for about $12 million. His response, though, laments that a forced sale would mean the Sterlings would incur "several hundred million dollars" in taxes they could avoid if they were allowed to keep the franchise and leave the team to their heirs. Sterling's wife, Shelly: We're just business partners CNN's Rosalina Nieves, Jill Martin and Michael Martinez contributed to this report. 
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/sport/tennis/serena-williams-french-open-tennis/index.html	iSport	Serena Williams crashes out of French Open, Venus defeated - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 08:52:44 EDT 2014	Follow us at @WorldSportCNN and like us on Facebook (CNN) -- It was deja vu for the Williams sisters at the French Open -- but not in a good way. A mouthwatering third-round clash between seven-time grand slam champion Venus and 17-time major winner Serena was ruled out when the former lost to unseeded Slovakian Anna Schmiedlova 2-6 6-3 6-4 in early play in Paris on Wednesday. Then hours later, Serena -- also the defending champion and world No. 1 -- fell to Spain's Garbine Muguruza 6-2 6-2, her worst ever grand slam performance. In 2008, the siblings were also defeated on the same day at Roland Garros, their least productive major. The last time it happened was at Wimbledon in 2011. Congrats 2 my opponent today. She did her thing. I'm proud of her. I wish her well. Until next time. There's always tomm & I will be ready. An 18th grand slam singles crown for Serena would have tied her with legends Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova but the younger of the tennis playing sisters has now been upset in consecutive majors. Venus has been hindered by debilitating autoimmune disease Sjogren's Syndrome in recent years though she looked solid in her first round match against the promising Swiss, Belinda Bencic. The top of the men's draw didn't see any such turmoil, and two of the favorites enjoyed straight sets victories on Wednesday. Novak Djokovic, the No. 2 seed from Serbia, breezed past France's Jeremy Chardy 6-1 6-4 6-2 in just over 90 minutes. Djokovic is looking for his first French Open title and will now face Crotia's Marin Cilic. Roger Federer, the 2009 champion, was also in cruise control as he dispatched Argentina's Diego Sebastian Schwartzman 6-3 6-4 6-4. The No. 4 seed will face Russia's Dmitry Tursunov in round three. Both players sympathized with Stan Wawrinka, the Australian Open champion who was knocked out in the opening round by Spanish outsider Guillermo Garcia-Lopez. "I understand what Wawrinka is going through. In 2008 when I won my first grand slam, I know how that period went after that," Djokovic told reporters. "It's the first time that you have to encounter pressure or expectations of being a favorite in grand slams." Federer also had some kind words for his compatriot, and said he was confident this would only prove a blip in his career. "With Stan, I understand where he is, because I was in such a position at a moment in my career, and it's not even the pressure itself. I think it's how you look at yourself and at your game," the Swiss told reporters. "Without changing everything, this is what he's got to work on and solve this, fix this. Little by little. It will not happen overnight. "But with Australia, with the Monte Carlo Masters, it's in his pocket already. Nobody can take this from him. It will give him time."

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/us/maya-angelou-obit/index.html	us	Legendary author Maya Angelou dies at age 86 - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 09:31:21 EDT 2014	Inspired by Maya Angelou? Read your favorite Angelou quote on video and send it to CNN iReport. (CNN) -- A literary voice revered globally for her poetic command and her commitment to civil rights has fallen silent. Maya Angelou died at her home in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, on Wednesday, said her literary agent, Helen Brann. The agent added that she has been "frail" and suffering from heart problems. The 86-year-old was a novelist, actress, professor, singer, dancer and activist. In 2010, President Barack Obama named her the recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian honor. One of Angelou's most praised books was "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings." The memoir bore witness to the brutality of a Jim Crow South, portraying racism in stark language. Readers learned of the life of Marguerite Ann Johnson (Angelou's birth name) up to the age of 16: how she was abandoned by her parents and raped by her mother's boyfriend. She was homeless and became a teen mother. Its publication was both daring and historic given the era of its debut in 1969. "All of the writers of my generation must honor the ground broken by Dr. Maya Angelou," author Tayari Jones posted on her Facebook page Wednesday. "She told a story that wasn't allowed to be told," Jones said. "Now, people tell all sorts of things in memoir, but when she told the truth, she challenged a taboo -- not for shock value, but to heal us all." Black American novelist Julian Mayfield is said to have described the autobiography as "a work of art which eludes description." "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" was an international bestseller and nominated for a National Book Award in 1970. In six other autobiographical books she subsequently penned, Angelou revealed myriad interests and occupations of her life. People of all ages and backgrounds took to social media to say what her life's work meant to them. Adrian Sean of Detroit posted a CNN iReport tribute, saying, "I cannot describe the feeling I had when I read 'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings' for the first time, and knew someone else in the world had been through extreme hardships just as I had. "She not only survived, but she thrived just by being herself," she said. "Maya Angelou was and still is a teacher, a mentor, and a friend to me. Her impact on my life will always have a special place in my heart." From a dropout to Dr. Angelou Angelou spent her early years studying dance and drama in San Francisco but dropped out of school at age 14. When she was 16, Angelou became San Francisco's first female streetcar driver. Angelou later returned to high school to get her diploma. She gave birth a few weeks after graduation. While the 17-year-old single mother waited tables to support her son, she developed a passion for music and dance, and toured Europe in the mid-1950s in the opera production "Porgy and Bess." In 1957, she recorded her first album, "Miss Calypso." In 1958, Angelou become a part of the Harlem Writers Guild in New York and played a queen in "The Blacks," an off-Broadway production by French dramatist Jean Genet. "I created myself," Angelou once said. "I have taught myself so much." Affectionately referred to as Dr. Angelou, 6-foot-tall professor never went to college. She has more than 30 honorary degrees and taught American studies for years at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem. "Maya Angelou has been a towering figure -- at Wake Forest and in American culture. She had a profound influence in civil rights and racial reconciliation," Wake Forest University President Nathan O. Hatch said Wednesday. "We will miss profoundly her lyrical voice and always keen insights." Angelou spoke at least six languages and worked as a newspaper editor in Egypt and Ghana. It was during that time that she wrote "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings," the first in a series of autobiographical books. "I want to write so well that a person is 30 or 40 pages in a book of mine ... before she realizes she's reading," Angelou said. Poetry after childhood tragedy Angelou was born April 4, 1928, in St. Louis. She grew up between St. Louis and the then-racially segregated town of Stamps, Arkansas. The famous poet got into writing after a childhood tragedy that stunned her into silence for years. When she was 7, her mother's boyfriend raped her. He was beaten to death by a mob after she testified against him. "My 7-and-a-half-year-old logic deduced that my voice had killed him, so I stopped speaking for almost six years," she said. From the silence, a louder voice was born. In her poem "Caged Bird," Angelou wrote: "A free bird leaps on the back of the wind and floats downstream till the current ends and dips his wing in the orange sun rays and dares to claim the sky. But a bird that stalks down his narrow cage can seldom see through his bars of rage his wings are clipped and his feet are tied so he opens his throat to sing." Surrounded by greats Angelou's list of friends is as impressive as her illustrious career. Talk show queen Oprah Winfrey referred to her as "sister friend." She counted Rosa Parks, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., with whom she worked during the civil rights movement, among her friends. King was assassinated on her birthday. In an interview with CNN in January 2009, just days before President Obama was inaugurated for his first term, she gave her thoughts about the United States' election of its first black president. "It was as if someone in the outer sphere said, 'What can we do to really show how important Martin Luther King was?'" Seeing Obama about to take office made her feel proud, she said. "I'm excited. I'm hopeful. I'm talking all the time to people, and sometimes I've really said it so many times I wonder if I'm coming off like a piece of tape recording, but I'm very proud to be an American. "In 30 or 40 years, (the election) will not be considered so incredibly important. ... There will be other people in those next three or four decades who will run for the presidency -- some women, some native American, some Spanish-speaking, some Asian. We're about to grow up in this country." Obama remembered Angelou on Wednesday, saying she was "one of the brightest lights of our time -- a brilliant writer, a fierce friend, and a truly phenomenal woman." He noted that she expressed her talents in many ways, but "above all, she was a storyteller" and "her greatest stories were true." The president said his own mother was so inspired by Angelou that she named his sister Maya. In Los Angeles, iconic music producer Quincy Jones said he was saddened to have lost a "dear friend, colleague and sister." The two collaborated on two songs on Jones' soundtrack for "For Love of Ivy" in 1968, he said, and working with her always "brought joy and love." A poem before Clinton's inauguration Author Tananarive Due, the Cosby Endowed Chair for the Humanities at Spelman College in Atlanta, remembered Angelou's reading at President Bill Clinton's first inauguration in 1993. She was the first poet to do so since Robert Frost in 1961. More notably, she was the first black woman to have such a prominent role. The poem, "On the Pulse of Morning," celebrates diversity of all people in America. Again, Angelou was influencing popular culture. Her reading probably introduced a younger generation to her and her pivotal body of work. "I felt like I belonged in my own nation -- at last," recalled Due. "She had a tremendous gift for choosing the right language to give us peace and power." The poem reads in part: "A Rock, A River, A Tree Hosts to species long since departed, Marked the mastodon. The dinosaur, who left dry tokens Of their sojourn here On our planet floor, Any broad alarm of their hastening doom Is lost in the gloom of dust and ages. But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully, Come, you may stand upon my Back and face your distant destiny, But seek no haven in my shadow. I will give you no more hiding place down here." 'A long journey' In CNN's 2009 interview, Angelou spoke in the way that she came to be famous for, each sentence a crescendo of emotion, a call to everyone to act and to be better. "Our country needs us all right now to stand up and be counted. We need to try to be great citizens. We are necessary in this country, and we need to give something -- that is to say, go to a local hospital, go to the children's ward and offer to the nurse in charge an hour twice a month that you can give them reading children's stories or poetry," she said. "And go to an old folks' home and read the newspaper to somebody. Go to your church or your synagogue or your mosque, and say, 'I'd like to be of service. I have one hour twice a month.' "You'll be surprised at how much better you will feel," she said. "And good done anywhere is good done everywhere." Some of Angelou's most powerful speeches Angelou was also one of the first black female film directors. Her work on Broadway has been nominated for Tony Awards. "Look where we've all come from ... coming out of darkness, moving toward the light," she once said. "It is a long journey, but a sweet one, bittersweet." Angelou reads her poem 'And I Still Rise' 2013: Anderson Cooper's conversation with Angelou People we've lost in 2014 CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Todd Leopold and Marlena Baldacci contributed to this report. 
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/politics/obama-west-point-foreign-policy/index.html	politics	Obama outlines foreign policy vision of 'might and right' - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 12:12:52 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Wednesday outlined a foreign policy vision of "might doing right," arguing that modern pragmatism requires both a strong military and the diplomatic tools of alliances and sanctions to exert influence and provide global leadership. He told graduating cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point that after the nation's "long season of war and divisions about how to move forward," they now would represent America with the duty "not only to protect our country, but to do what is right and just." Under fire from the political right for what critics call diminishing U.S. global influence, Obama offered a robust defense of his foreign policy as the pragmatic and most effective expression of America's leadership role in the world. "I believe in American exceptionalism with every fiber of my being," he said, referring to a tenet of conservative ideology. "But what makes us exceptional is not flouting international norms and the rule of law; it's our willingness to affirm them through our actions," Obama said in arguing that true leadership involves not only having the world's most powerful military, but in doing the right thing. "America must always lead on the world stage," Obama said, and the military "always will be the backbone of that leadership," but U.S. military action "cannot be the only -- or even primary -- component of our leadership in every instance." Read the President's speech In a sign of the sentiments of the cadets, Obama got big applause when he noted they were the first West Point graduates in more than a decade unlikely to be stationed in a war zone. Since he took office, Obama noted, America had ended the Iraq war and was preparing to end the Afghanistan conflict, decimated al Qaeda's leadership in the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and eliminated Osama bin Laden. Now it was time to shift foreign policy to combat a continuing terrorist threat that "no longer comes from a centralized al Qaeda leadership," but from "decentralized al Qaeda affiliates and extremists, with agendas focused in the countries where they operate." "This lessens the possibility of large-scale 9/11-style attacks against the homeland, but heightens the danger of U.S. personnel overseas being attacked, as we saw in Benghazi," Obama said in reference to the 2012 assault that killed four Americans at a U.S. compound in Libya. "It heightens the danger to less defensible targets, as we saw in a shopping mall in Nairobi," he said of the attack last year in Kenya. "So we have to develop a strategy that matches this diffuse threat; one that expands our reach without sending forces that stretch our military thin, or stir up local resentments." Returning to a theme he's visited throughout his presidency, Obama said he would continue to push for closing the terrorist detention facility at Guantanamo Bay "because American values and legal traditions don't permit the indefinite detention of people beyond our borders." Overall, Obama said, "America has rarely been stronger relative to the rest of the world," and he contended that "those who argue otherwise -- who suggest that America is in decline, or has seen its global leadership slip away -- are either misreading history or engaged in partisan politics." "The question we face -- the question each of you will face -- is not whether America will lead, but how we will lead, not just to secure our peace and prosperity, but also extend peace and prosperity around the globe," Obama told the cadets. The President's speech came a day after he spelled out a plan that would leave nearly 10,000 troops in Afghanistan at year's end but essentially end the broader U.S. military commitment there by the end of 2016. "We can not only responsibly end our war in Afghanistan and achieve the objectives that took us to war in the first place, we'll also be able to begin a new chapter in the story of American leadership around the world," Obama said in the White House Rose Garden on Tuesday. Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai welcomed Obama's announcement of planned troop levels, saying in a statement posted Wednesday on his official website that his government was "grateful to the international community for its assistance and remains confident" in the ability of the expanded and NATO-trained Afghan forces to protect the country and its people. 5 foreign policy headaches for Obama Although Obama enjoyed high-profile foreign-policy successes at the beginning of his time in office, including the military mission to find and kill bin Laden, he's come under harsh criticism recently for what opponents say is a passive approach abroad. They cite his record in Syria, where he backed away from airstrikes after President Bashar al-Assad's regime was reported to have used chemical weapons on citizens. Congress balked at approving the military force, leaving Obama to instead negotiate a deal that would remove the chemical stockpiles from al-Assad's control but keep al-Assad himself in power amid an ongoing civil war. In his speech Wednesday, Obama said there was no military solution to the Syrian civil war, and added that he will "work with Congress to ramp up support for those in the Syrian opposition who offer the best alternative to terrorists and a brutal dictator." Earlier, Secretary of State John Kerry defended U.S. policy for Syria, including the deal struck to get chemical weapons out of the country. Speaking to CNN's "New Day," he said he found it difficult to believe that critics would have preferred a military strike and hurting the al-Assad regime temporarily. He said that 92% of Syria's chemical weapons have been removed, and the other 8% are under control, waiting to be removed. "It's remarkable to me that people simply want to refuse to accept that we're better off getting all of the weapons out than striking for one or two days and doing damage to some of them," Kerry said. Critics of Obama's foreign policy also have said the President's clear assertion that military force is off the table in Ukraine sends the wrong message to other countries -- namely China -- that have their own territorial disputes with neighbor states. The United States and its allies have imposed economic sanctions on Russia for its incursion into Ukraine, though that step hasn't done much to quiet the arguments coming from Obama's detractors. On Wednesday, Obama reiterated his policy that the United States will used military force, "unilaterally if necessary," when its people are threatened, its livelihood is at stake or allies are in danger, but he said the threshold was higher when global issues "do not pose a direct threat" to the nation. "In such circumstances, we should not go it alone," he said. "Instead, we must mobilize allies and partners to take collective action. We have to broaden our tools to include diplomacy and development; sanctions, isolation; appeals to international law and -- if just, necessary, and effective -- multilateral military action." Such a collective approach "is more likely to succeed, more likely to be sustained, and less likely to lead to costly mistakes," Obama said. Obama last spoke broadly about his foreign policy during a trip to Asia in April, defending himself against those who say his policy lacks a discernable direction. "You hit singles; you hit doubles; every once in a while we may be able to hit a home run," Obama said in Manila, lashing out at those who argue for greater use of military force in conflicts abroad. "Why is it that everyone is so eager to use military force?" he asked then. "After we have just gone through a decade of war at enormous costs to our troops and our budget. And what is it exactly that these critics would have accomplished?" According to aides, Obama's West Point speech kicks off a broader foreign policy push that will carry into his upcoming trip to Europe that includes a G7 summit in Brussels and a visit to Poland, designed to reassure Eastern European allies after Russia's intervention in Ukraine.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/us/edward-snowden-interview/index.html	us	NSA leaker Edward Snowden 'was trained as a spy,' he tells NBC - CNN.com	2014/05/27	Tuesday May 27 10:21:03 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- A low-level systems administrator? Or a highly trained spy? Edward Snowden sought to bolster his credentials during an interview with NBC "Nightly News" anchor Brian Williams. The one-hour interview, Snowden's first with a U.S. television network, is scheduled to air at 10 p.m. ET on Wednesday. An excerpt aired Tuesday night. "I was trained as a spy in sort of the traditional sense of the word -- in that I lived and worked undercover, overseas, pretending to work in a job that I'm not -- and even being assigned a name that was not mine," Snowden said. "Now, the government might deny these things. They might frame it in certain ways, and say, oh, well, you know, he's a low-level analyst. "But what they're trying to do is they're trying to use one position that I've had in a career, here or there, to distract from the totality of my experience, which is that I've worked for the Central Intelligence Agency, undercover, overseas. "I've worked for the National Security Agency, undercover, overseas. And I've worked for the Defense Intelligence Agency as a lecturer at the Joint Counterintelligence Training Academy, where I developed sources and methods for keeping our information and people secure in the most hostile and dangerous environments around the world." Snowden continued: "So when they say I'm a low-level systems administrator, that I don't know what I'm talking about, I'd say it's somewhat misleading." A spokeswoman for the NSA declined to comment Tuesday on the NBC report. Williams traveled to Moscow, where Snowden fled to escape prosecution for leaking classified documents that detailed U.S. surveillance programs. Snowden hasn't been able to leave Russia since U.S. officials charged him with espionage and revoked his passport. What he leaked sparked a national debate about privacy and security. President Barack Obama and military officials remain in support of mass, warrantless surveillance. But civil libertarians, technology companies and others oppose it, noting the lack of transparency.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/world/asia/pakistan-pregnant-woman-killed/index.html	world	Pregnant woman stoned to death by family members in Pakistani city - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 05:59:21 EDT 2014	Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A pregnant woman is beaten to death by her relatives outside a court building. Her crime? To elope with the man she loved rather than marry the groom chosen by her family. The terrible fate of Farzana Parveen, 25, is one shared by all too many women in Pakistan and elsewhere. She was killed in the name of "honor," on the grounds her actions had brought shame on her family. "I do not even wish to use the phrase 'honour killing': there is not the faintest vestige of honour in killing a woman in this way," UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said in a statement condemning the killing. Pillay called on Pakistan's government to work harder to stop such killings and protect women from violence. According to a report published in April by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, 869 women in the country were the victims of honor killings last year. And activists say the true number may be much higher. Parveen's brutal killing is all the more shocking because it was so public. She was beaten to death with bricks close to the high court in the eastern city of Lahore by a group of about 20 people, including her brothers, father and cousin, police said. One family member made a noose of rough cloth around her neck while her brothers smashed bricks into her skull, said Mushtaq Ahmed, a police official, citing the preliminary report into the killing. She was three months pregnant, he said. So-called honor killings often originate from tribal traditions in Pakistan, but are not a part of Islam. Although they're common in rural areas, Tuesday's attack in a public area of a big city was unusual. Police officials said Parveen, who came from a village in Punjab, had refused to wed the cousin whom her family had selected for her, choosing instead to elope with a widower named Mohammad Iqbal. The cousin intended for her husband was among the people who attacked her, police said. Sudanese woman sentenced to death for her Christianity gives birth 'Barbaric' attack The family had challenged Parveen's marriage to Iqbal in the courts, accusing him of abducting her. The attack took place as she was on her way from her lawyer's office to the high court in Lahore, where she was expected to make a declaration that she had married Iqbal of her own volition. One of Pakistan's leading newspapers, The Nation, expressed outrage over Parveen's killing . "The familiar brand of barbaric 'justice' yet again triumphs over the written law of the land," it said in an editorial Wednesday. "Another case is settled outside the courts. Another woman, in search of justice, stoned to death, in the name of honor." Farzana Bari, a human rights activist based in Islamabad, said the real number may be far higher than the Human Rights Commission's official count since many families don't report the crimes. She said that in many cases, people outside the family don't step in to protect the victim. "I've seen in the past people stand around and watch, and don't intervene because it is a private matter," she told CNN on Wednesday. "I think honor killing is very much part of our culture. It is a cultural form of violence which is quite prevalent in certain parts of Pakistan." Honor killings happen more often in rural, tribal areas, Bari said, but urban cases occur too. Since many cases are not reported, police have no record and rights groups that try to document what's happening must do so through media reports and incomplete data. "There is no systematic information gathered in Pakistan that tells us the extent of the problem," she said. Impunity said to encourage killers And the killers often avoid prosecution. Under an Islamic element of Pakistani law, known as the law of Diyat, the family of a victim is allowed to forgive the perpetrator, according to the human rights commission's report. "Thus the victim's family usually is related to the perpetrator as well, and conveniently forgives their kin, absolving them of the murder," the report said. That possibility of impunity has "continued to encourage others to follow suit," it said. Bari gave a similar picture -- and called for a change in Pakistan's laws to protect women and the vulnerable. "Basically, the people have no fear of law because there is a culture of impunity and, as a result of that, people feel free and they can commit such acts outside the courts of justice," she said. She blames such actions also on violent and extremist attitudes which, she said, drive people to act even if they are aware of the potential consequences. "I think we must generally reflect on the sick mindset of the society," she said. Police said they had arrested Parveen's father, whose name they gave only as Azeem. They said he had admitted to the killing and expressed no regret. Search warrants are out for the other men accused of attacking her.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/politics/mississippi-senate-primary/index.html	politics	Nasty Senate race digs deeper in the mud - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 12:02:34 EDT 2014	Biloxi, Mississippi (CNN) -- A conservative blogger is in jail -- arrested for allegedly breaking into a Mississippi nursing home to photograph U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran's ailing wife, who is suffering from dementia. "It's the worst," says the narrator of a new Cochran campaign ad airing in the final stretch before the June 3 primary, not so subtly pointing the finger at his GOP Senate challenger, Chris McDaniel, trying to stir up voter disgust. This race, one of the nastiest so far this election year, has gotten even deeper in the Mississippi mud than that. Cochran supporters argue the reason the blogger and tea party activist took Mrs. Cochran's picture was to feed questions about the senator and his longtime aide, Kay Webber. Cochran: Quiet pragmatist faces re-election challenge Conservative outlets that back McDaniel have been all over the fact Cochran rents a basement apartment in Webber's D.C. home, and that Webber has traveled extensively with Cochran on the taxpayer's dime. McDaniel's campaign often forwards these reports to its media email list, while the Cochran campaign calls her trips with the senator part of her job and suggestions of anything untoward are sexist. New ads in nasty Mississippi primary This Republican primary was supposed to be about the big struggle of ideas within the GOP: a 36-year Senate veteran being challenged by a young tea party-backed opponent who calls the senator a big-spending, out-of-touch Republican too entrenched in Washington. Now McDaniel is fending off questions about whether his campaign was involved in trying to photograph Cochran's sick wife. "Our campaign had absolutely no connection to that whatsoever, and the evidence has shown that. What we're doing right now -- we're talking about the issues," McDaniel told CNN in an interview. The next Ted Cruz? But what gave ammunition to Cochran allies is that McDaniel's story about when he found out about the break-in has been inconsistent. When we asked for clarification, McDaniel wouldn't go there, replying, "Look, we're going to focus on his record." Three more arrested in Mississippi Senate primary scandal If McDaniel has his way, he would be the next Ted Cruz, going to the Senate to shake things up -- stick to conservative principles, compromise be damned. "We don't have six more years of the status quo," he said. "I am not going to Washington D.C. to be a member of the cocktail circuit or to make backroom deals. I'm going up there to fight and defend the Constitution. We don't have time to waste. So with all due respect I would suggest they join me in this fight because they've been silent far too long," he told us. "He and I are very different with our ideology. He's a guy that believes in big government. He believes in big spending. He believes in increasing taxes. He believes in increasing his own pay. I am not that guy," McDaniel said. For the tea party movement nationwide -- after a string of primary losses this election year from Kentucky to Idaho -- McDaniel has been its great hope of 2014, the candidate with the best chance of toppling an establishment Republican. Things were looking good for McDaniel earlier this year, especially after Cochran stumbled by telling a local reporter here that "the tea party is something I don't really know a lot about." Millions of dollars pouring into Mississippi against Cochran come from a who's who of national tea party groups nationwide: Citizens United, Club For Growth, Senate Conservatives Fund, Tea Party Patriots and Freedomworks. The Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit group that tracks money in politics, says outside groups have spent $7.6 million on the race, much of it for McDaniel and against Cochran. 2014 midterms: Key races Fighting back against tea party challenges But like other Republican incumbents this year, Cochran and his allies are fighting back hard. Henry Barbour, nephew of former Mississippi governor and RNC chairman Haley Barbour, formed a super PAC called Mississippi Conservatives to help Cochran. They have been airing aggressive ads slamming McDaniel as extreme, inconsistent and out of touch with Mississippi's needs. Other traditional GOP groups like the Chamber of Commerce have also come in with ads supporting Cochran, like they have for GOP incumbents in other states this year. Still, Cochran's four decades in Washington have won him loyal supporters. On Memorial Day, Cochran attended an event in Vicksburg. He was invited by the Democratic mayor, George Flaggs, who called him a "mentor" and "great friend." Flaggs told CNN he intends to vote for Cochran in the GOP primary since Mississippi law allows Democrats and others not registered as Republicans to participate. He said Cochran fights hard for Mississippi's needs and calls his seniority -- ranking Republican on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, a big plus for the state. "He's a leader; he's a statesman, and he's what we need in Washington. So stay as long as he wants to stay," Flagg said. Republican Briggs Hopson serves with McDaniel in the Mississippi state Senate, and told CNN he likes McDaniel but that Cochran is the "best person for Mississippi right now." "Seniority can be a plus. People can lose touch and get lazy and all those things but I don't think that's the case with Senator Cochran. He's been responsive to the needs in Mississippi for many years," Hopson told CNN. 'Those days are over' When we put those bipartisan sentiments to McDaniel he responded with an emphatic, "come on!" "I say name one fight Senator Cochran's lead against Barack Obama. Name one time he's raised his voice in defense of conservatism. Name one time he's fought back the liberal agenda. Name one piece of legislation he's authored in 42 years that benefited the conservative cause. Name one thing that he's been outwardly aggressive about. And they can't name one," McDaniel told CNN. "Look, there may have been a time for that in 1973 when he first went to Washington. Maybe when Richard Nixon was president that was the thing people did. Those days are over." We wanted to ask Cochran himself why he thinks he should get another six years, after serving 36 in the U.S. Senate and six before that in the House. But Cochran is trying to run out the clock and avoid unforced errors -- and going to head-scratching extremes to avoid talking to reporters like us. We tried to catch Cochran after his event in Vicksburg, but when an aide came out and saw us waiting, they did a bait and switch -- the car they told us Cochran was getting into screeched away without him, while he snuck out another door and left in another car, leaving reporters in the dust.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/us/california-anonymous-donor-hidden-cash-twitter/index.html	us	@HiddenCash lines pockets, warms heart of anonymous philanthropist - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 12:11:50 EDT 2014	San Francisco (CNN) -- It's a scavenger hunt for cash through the most modern of means: social media. An anonymous, wealthy California man is hiding up to $100 or so in public places in San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose and then posting clues to the money's whereabouts through his Twitter page, appropriately dubbed Hidden Cash. The $100 bills or envelopes containing several $20 bills are amounting to $1,000-a-day philanthropy in what the Twitter account calls "an anonymous social experiment for good." The results have been a feel-good sensation in California: The Twitter page features selfies of joyous people who found the money -- flashing smiles and cash -- with testimonials of what they're going to do next. The cash hunts ventured into a third city, San Jose, on Wednesday. The anonymous donor and owner of the Twitter page is a real estate investor who's had the good fortune of joining the wealthiest 1% of American society, especially in the past few years, he said. When he recently closed a deal with a six-figure profit, the philanthropist decided to "give some of it back" through random acts of kindness, he told CNN. "This is not a set-up charity, but I wanted to do something fun and creative," he said. "We were thinking of something like the 'Survivor' TV show or something of that nature that was a scavenger hunt. They were basically too involved. So what we did was hide cash in different places. I thought it would be fun, but it's also something simple to execute. All you're doing is leaving money and putting clues on Twitter." The man said he's between ages 35 and 45 -- and would give no more information. He maintains anonymity because he wants the attention on his pay-it-forward activities, not himself. "There's some crazy people out there in the world," he added. This week, he will expand his hunt-for-cash giveaway to Los Angeles and possibly other cities across the country, if he can secure helpers, he said. He's been giving away about a grand daily since Friday, he said. For example, his Twitter page offered this clue Tuesday with a photograph of San Francisco's waterfront and the Golden Gate Bridge: "New drop: come for the cash, stay for the views." The @HiddenCash page even taunted his followers -- which had grown to 70,000 by Tuesday afternoon -- by stating: "Surprising with almost 70k followers, but the $$$ I just left the water is still there 15+ minutes later. And that was an easy one!" Izzy Miller, a San Francisco college student, was the lucky hunter who found the $100 bill in an envelope. Miller posted a photograph of himself and the folded $100 bill, joined by CNN correspondent Dan Simon, who found Miller just after Miller found the Benjamin Franklin. Miller learned of the clue after his phone alerted him about a new tweet posted by Hidden Cash. Miller rolled out of bed and dashed to the waterfront. There, he found the ka-ching in an envelope taped to a tourist information box. "I think it's awesome," Miller said. "It's a totally fun thing to do, and the fact that he's doing it in a philanthropic and charitable mindset makes it even cooler." Miller said he would buy climbing shoes with the money. The anonymous donor is emotionally moved by the words and photos that successful searchers post on Twitter, he said. "There's absolutely no political agenda; there's no religious agenda; there's no business agenda," the man said of his unconventional philanthropy. "The whole agenda is random acts of kindness and pay it forward and to put a smile on people's face. "When I see people retweet the photos and say, 'I could have really used this money' or 'my autistic stepson found it' or 'we shared it with people that were with us at the beach' or 'I bought lunch for my coworkers' or 'just giving it charities,' there's a lot of heartwarming stories for people," he said. The anonymous man plans to continue the cash giveaways for the indefinite future. Money is no object for him. It's only the time it takes to set up the hunts. "I'm running around leaving money in different places, and there's only one me," he said, adding that a friend is helping. He would like other wealthy people across the country to follow his lead: "I'd like for this to become a movement," establishing a chain reaction of charitable giving. "If you can give back, it's at least as rewarding as making good investments and getting big checks and making a lot of money." He urges people not to look to him -- or lotteries -- as a godsend. There are plenty of job and business opportunities if people look hard enough, he asserted. "I want to say to the people that are struggling, please realize it's a game. It's pay it forward. Don't look to this or to the lottery to be your financial salvation," he said. Still, solicitations flood his inbox: He's now overwhelmed by e-mails (his address is on the Twitter page) from people seeking money for a down payment, mortgage payment, child's college tuition or even dental work. "That's more than I really bargained for," the man said. Still, he has no plans to stop the small-treasure hunts. "I'm having a great time," he declared. The only people who have figured out his identity are his friends, who identified his voice from his audio-only interviews with northern California broadcast outlets.

http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/05/living/irpt-real-60s/index.html	living	What the late '60s really looked like - CNN.com	2013/04/05	Friday Apr 5 08:15:26 EDT 2013	Editor's note: This is an update of a story that originally ran in April 2013. Do you have family or personal photos from the 1960s? Share them with iReport!  (CNN) -- As "Mad Men" returns for its seventh season, many viewers will tune in to see what happens next for Don, Peggy, Pete and the other characters of the hit AMC show. Many will also be eager to see the fabulous clothes they wear. We can't help but wonder -- was all that glamour real, or is it just the magic of TV? We asked readers to share their snapshots from 1967-69 and show us what the late '60s really looked like. Janie Lambert, 61, says she thinks "Mad Men" portrays the decade's conservative fashion and mod look accurately. But she remembers the late 1960s as more colorful and vibrant. "My favorite looks in the '60s were the bright colors and bold patterns, stripes and polka dots, miniskirts, long hair and pale lipstick," Lambert says. 'Mad Men' and the other 1960s Many iReporters strived to keep up with the fast pace of the changing fashion in the late '60s. Patricia Anne Alfano, 66, went from a British-inspired mod style cheerleader to a hippie in a matter of three years. In 1967, Alfano was an "Eaglette" -- an NFL cheerleader for the Philadelphia Eagles. Unlike today, the cheerleaders were covered from head to toe. The uniforms had long sleeves, and the cheerleaders wore gloves and cloth helmets. "From the early 1960s until 1967, I spent tons of time on my hair," she says, noting her mod hairdo in the picture is actually a wig. "Wigs were big back then. Everyone had at least one." In 1968, the style began to evolve. Alfano still spent a lot of time on her hair, but her peers began heavily criticizing all things materialistic, so the style became more casual. "I was still 'fussing' a bit with my hair, but the times were changing, and so was I," she says. The changing fashion of 'Mad Men' A year later, Alfano joined the "flower children," moved to California, grew her hair out and wore more flowing clothes. She says many women stopped dying their hair or wearing makeup. Some even stopped shaving. "It was all part of the 'revolution,' and the anti-establishment movement," Alfano says. "I must say, though, that through these turbulent times, I did continue shaving my legs and underarms." Living large in Don Draper's New York In 1969, the fashion changed to more vibrant, hippie clothing. Though Nikki C. Morris, 64, wore a yellow dress with long white gloves to her high school prom in 1967, colorful dresses in the late 1960s weren't too appealing to her. "All I remember about the fashion of that time was that it was too colorful for my tastes," Morris says. "I remember thinking that most of the dresses and the girls wearing them looked like Easter eggs. I wasn't a fan."  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/world/asia/vietnam-china-dispute-mckirdy/index.html	world	A dangerous dance: China, Vietnam posture in the South China Sea - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 03:27:09 EDT 2014	Vietnamese Coast Guard 8003, South China Sea (CNN) -- It takes a long time to get to the middle of nowhere. For a contingent of almost 40 reporters, hours of waiting both on land and then at sea preceded a trip to one of the world's most hotly contested areas of maritime real estate. The Vietnamese government had been at pains to keep this media trip under wraps, keeping print, online and broadcast journalists from Asia and the United States guessing as to the day and time of departure. That secrecy may have been for naught: at a pre-departure briefing we are told that while the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not formally informed its Chinese counterpart of the presence of journalists in the area, a Coast Guard official mentions that "chances are" China knows about it. But depart we do, boarding a small coastguard support vessel Monday evening as the sun dies over Da Nang, bound for the disputed waters surrounding the South China Sea's Paracel Islands, known to China as the Xisha Islands. China's controversial installation of an oil-rig in these waters at the beginning of May sparked protests -- some of which turned violent -- in Vietnam and statements from a variety of world leaders, urging the two sides to resolve this dispute quickly and without bloodshed. READ: Chinese ships reach Vietnam to evacuate citizens One side, at least, appears to be in agreement. "The Vietnamese Coast Guard are committed to resolving the situation peacefully," says Hoang Tuan Anh, the captain of the supply ship upon which we hitch a ride. Strictly utilitarian, our sturdy ride boasts one 125mm cannon on its prow and two 14.5mm guns aft. It is the kind of supply ship that every coast guard needs, and also houses a huge number of plastic 10-gallon jugs of drinking water, a galley piled with vegetables, and a bevy of live chickens under one of the exterior staircases -- supplies badly needed by their crew mates and friends on the front line. As the sun rises again the next morning, we're still chugging steadily toward our destination, claimed by both China and Vietnam. Vietnamese boat sinks after collision with Chinese vessel Clear message A mid-sea ship change to CG 8003 -- and slightly less cramped conditions -- awaits us as noon approaches. By then we have reached the area where China had, earlier in the month, unilaterally planted a flag on this area of supposedly oil rich sea. The flag, in this case, was an imposing oil-rig that sent a clear message: the Xisha Islands are ours to do with what we will. READ: How an oil rig sparked anti-China riots in Vietnam No buoys mark the territory, and there is no landfall in sight: just a shimmering expanse of deep water, albeit one with the promise of fossil fuel riches beneath. As we arrive news comes that the rig -- run by state-owned oil company the China National Offshore Oil Corporation's (CNOOC) -- has been moved: no small task for something as big and unwieldy -- yet politically volatile. The operation to move the structure began on Monday morning and was completed by 10.30 p.m. local time, just hours after our voyage began but, equally, hours before we arrived in the zone. Approaching the area, dots on the horizon become ships, which then become a flotilla -- or perhaps more accurately two separate flotilla -- of both Chinese and Vietnamese commercial and coast guard vessels. This mishmash of fishing and military vessels is all that remains of the flashpoint of a couple of weeks ago, and in a seemingly stage-crafted set of maneuvers dance around this expanse of utterly blue, clear sea. Aggressive foghorns It's a lively affair, alternating between angry, static-y rhetoric that informs the Chinese that they are in violation of international law, and aggressive foghorns and sirens, raising a cacophony on this otherwise peaceful, sunny afternoon. "I've traveled out to these waters many times but recently the Chinese have been more aggressive towards the Vietnamese," says Hoang, captain of the support vessel. "I'm proud to protect Vietnam." The dance is supervised by the respective country's coast guard vessels, who hopefully have too much sense to engage directly with each other. But hanging over the day's events is the knowledge that just hours before, a Chinese fishing vessel had rammed and sunk one of its Vietnamese counterparts. READ: Vietnamese boat sinks after collision with Chinese vessel No lives were lost in this incident but it is the first time that a boat has been sunk in this chapter of the often-acrimonious relationship between these two ideologically similar neighbors. As the afternoon begins to wrap up, one of the larger Chinese coast-guard vessel homes in on our ship, horn blasting incoherently as it attempts a little maritime brinksmanship. Nobody on board CG 8003 seems to be overly worried, although life jackets are donned as a fillip. Like a dog reaching the end of its chain, the Chinese vessel barks at us a few remaining times, before turning heel. Off the starboard bow, two other Chinese vessels harry a smaller Vietnamese fishing boat, pushing it further from the center of this disagreement which, if left untended, could have dramatic consequences for these two countries, key players in a region that is -- perhaps belatedly -- starting to buck under the weight of Chinese hegemony.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/tech/innovation/google-self-driving-car/index.html	tech	Google self-driving car has no steering wheel or brake - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 12:03:41 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- If you're uneasy at the idea of riding in a vehicle that drives itself, just wait till you see Google's new car. It has no gas pedal, no brake and no steering wheel. Google has been demonstrating its driverless technology for several years by retrofitting Toyotas, Lexuses and other cars with cameras and sensors. But now, for the first time, the company has unveiled a prototype of its own: a cute little car that looks like a cross between a VW Beetle and a golf cart. "They won't have a steering wheel, accelerator pedal, or brake pedal ... because they don't need them," Google said Tuesday in a blog post introducing the unnamed electric vehicles. "Our software and sensors do all the work." Unlike previous models, these cars won't have human drivers monitoring them at all times. Google said the cars can detect objects up to 200 yards away in all directions and adjust their speed, turns and braking accordingly. The cars' speed for now has been capped at 25 mph, allowing engineers to minimize the risk of crashes during testing. Inside, the spartan cars have few dashboard controls, no glove box and no stereo. "We've designed for learning, not luxury, so we're light on creature comforts," Google said. "But we'll have two seats (with seatbelts), a space for passengers' belongings, buttons to start and stop, and a screen that shows the route -- and that's about it." Google did not explain how the car navigates, although passengers would presumably punch in a destination on the dashboard screen and let the computers do the rest. The company plans to build about 100 prototype vehicles and begin testing them later this summer. If everything goes well, Google then will run a small pilot program in California over the next few years. The cars represent another step into hardware for Google, which in recent years has introduced its Glass connected headset and bought Nest, a startup that makes "smart" thermostats and smoke detectors. Google said it eventually hopes to partner with an automaker to produce the self-driving vehicles instead of building them itself. The bubblelike Google cars arrive as the U.S. is struggling to accept a sci-fi future of robotic vehicles and other technological advancements. A recent Pew survey found that half of Americans would not ride in a self-driving car. Four states -- California, Nevada, Florida and Michigan -- now allow self-driving vehicles on their roads as long as a human driver is behind the wheel at all times. Most major automakers are also developing vehicles that drive autonomously. Google posted a video Tuesday featuring testimonials from people who had ridden in the new cars. "The human feeling of it is very well engineered, and it is very smooth," said an older man identified only as Nick. "There's nothing that makes you feel the least bit threatened."

But recent efforts by conservation groups to ban the much-loved deep fried shark sandwich in Trinidad and Tobago have proved these experiences are often fraught with cultural difficulties, especially for travelers who like to experiment with new experiences. Here are some of the more exotic food items travelers might encounter, along with reasons some say you should avoid them. Ortolan (France) The ortolan is a songbird found throughout Europe. In France, home to one of the largest populations, it's a delicacy traditionally consumed beneath a napkin, because it's eaten whole, the entire creature devoured in one mouthful. The dish featured in the latest "Hannibal" TV series. Poachers illegally kill thousands every year and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimates that the species has declined by 30% over the past decade. "The population has declined steadily due to illegal hunting purely to satisfy epicurean appetites," says Professor Stanley Temple, a conservation expert at the University of Wisconsin. "We have a terrible history of decimating birds like the ortolan, which are hunted solely for illicit profit."

You're mostly likely to come across shark fin soup in China, where the expensive dish is traditionally served at weddings, or to welcome guests and to show respect at other formal occasions. In Asia, consumption of shark fins and meat is legal, and Taiwan is the only Asian country to ban the controversial practice of finning, which involves removing the shark's fin and discarding the rest of the carcass at sea. Recently some airlines and hotels in Hong Kong removed shark fin from their menus in response to the controversy and China banned the serving of shark fin at official government banquets.

Diminishing numbers and the widely condemned breeding conditions found at the world's only legal breeding facility in the Cayman Islands mean travelers should avoid this dish, according to some. "Whilst some local communities may depend on turtle meat for subsistence and cultural reasons, there's no need for travelers or tourists to eat this endangered animal," points out Elise Neve at the World Society for the Protection of Animals.

You're most likely to find a plateful of pangolin in China, where it's now illegal to hunt the animal. The pangolins' secretive, solitary and nocturnal habits have made it hard to estimate numbers, although records point to a sharp decrease. 7 ways to save the pangolin "Pangolins look like armor-plated lizards, but are shy, nocturnal mammals," explains Simon Pope, director of campaigns and communications at World Society for the Protection of Animals. "The wildlife trade network TRAFFIC has reported that the insatiable demand for pangolin meat has decimated populations and demand from China is now seeing pangolins in Africa being hunted for the Asian restaurant market." MORE: Off the menu: China moves to protect endangered species Western long-beaked echidna (Papua New Guinea) The Western long-beaked echidna's native home is New Guinea, but the threat of extinction looms large due to hunting for human consumption. It's one of only two species of mammal to lay eggs (the other is the platypus), and is key to understanding mammalian evolution. The Papua New Guinean government has banned commercial hunting but traditional hunting with dogs is permitted. They're now incredibly rare in New Guinea, but breeding programs carried out by zoos in other countries are going some way to safeguard the species' future. Mountain chicken/giant ditch frog (Dominica, Montserrat) This super-sized amphibian may not look too appealing as a delicacy, but its popularity in the Caribbean has seen the population decline by 80% over the past decade. The meat regularly appears on restaurant menus, although it's now only found on Dominica and Montserrat. The IUCN, which lists the species as critically endangered, says up to 36,000 were being killed every year as recently as 2002, and estimates there are now just 8,000 remaining. Gorilla (Republic of the Congo) Gorillas have been pushed to the brink of extinction due to their popularity as bushmeat. In cities such as Pointe Noire in the Republic of the Congo, smoked gorilla meat is sold openly (but illegally) at markets. It's believed that more than 400 gorillas are killed for bushmeat every year, despite the fact that the species is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. The species' low productive rates mean that even low levels of hunting have a devastating effect on populations.

Over the past 30 years, over-harvesting for the food trade -- they sell for $1,000 a piece -- has seen an 80% decline in numbers, and it's now classed as critically endangered by the IUCN. Over-harvesting hasn't just threatened its survival but stunted its growth -- scientists believe that hunters' preference for larger salamanders is the reason they no longer grow beyond six feet in length. "Chinese giant salamander should always be avoided," says Claire Christian at the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition. "This species has declined to extremely low levels." Dolphin (Japan, Taiwan) Sale of dolphin meat for consumption is common and legal in Japan, although it's often mislabeled and sold as whale meat, which sells for much more. Although the way in which the dolphins are killed is controversial, most notably as highlighted by the movie "The Cove," none of the species being hunted in Japan are listed as endangered. In Taiwan, the catching, selling and consumption of dolphin meat was banned in 1989. Despite this, 1,000 dolphins are caught illegally there every year and dolphin fishcakes are often sold openly at street food stalls, especially in Western Taiwan.

Now it welcomes all, even a rumored resident ghost. With their hallowed hallways, romantic turrets and fairy-tale-like charms, castles have long intrigued travelers, especially Americans who have no such royal history stateside. Fortunately, you don't need a king's ransom: Our favorite European castle hotels start at $98 a night and many have hosted notable aristocrats. Switzerland's Wartegg Castle made a scenic lakeside refuge for the exiled Zita of Bourbon-Parma (Austria's last empress), while Belgium's Chteau d'Hassonville was the former hunting grounds of French enfant terrible Louis XIV. Rooms hark back to the 17th century with trappings like bronze busts, thick drapery, fireplaces and even complimentary carafes of port. Even scientists aren't immune to the magic of castles. Southern Sweden's Hckeberga Castle won over botanist Carl Linnaeus, who praised its flora and fauna. Look for ravens, white-tailed eagles and red deer in the beechwood forests along the region's new Linnaeus hiking trail -- just be back to the castle in time for a fresh seafood dinner. Without further ado, here's our list of affordable European castle hotels: Parador de Oropesa, Spain Legend has it that this 14th-century castillo in the foothills of the Sierra de Gredos was built on a site first settled in 1716 B.C. by Hercules's soldiers. Whatever its origins, Oropesa is undoubtedly one of Spain's oldest paradors. Forty-eight rooms are scattered with vintage tiles, colorful throw rugs, hand-painted canopy beds and Peruvian folk art imported by former resident Count of Oropesa, Francisco de Toledo, who served as the viceroy of Peru from 1569 to 1581. A swimming pool commands extensive views of the surrounding mountains, olive trees and the whitewashed medieval village of Oropesa, while the loggia-style terrace is a great place to linger over a creamy cod with salsa Antigua Monacal and glass of Rioja. parador.es/en; rooms from $125. Travel + Leisure: Europe's most beautiful villages Chteau d'Isenbourg, France At a bend of the Rhine where Switzerland, Germany and France converge, this Alsatian member of the Small Luxury Hotel collection was the former royal residence of Dagobert II in the seventh-century Merovingian era. Now the castle hosts visitors in frilly Rococo-style rooms and encourages them to relax, whether by the outdoor swimming pool or in the Turkish bath and sauna (a few glasses of Alsatian wine from the 12th-century cellars also do nicely). The chteau is not far from Colmar, one of Europe's most beautiful villages, and overlooks the medieval city of Rouffach, the Black Forest and the Vosges foothills. slh.com; rooms from $191. 8 elegant U.S. mansion hotels Chteau d'Hassonville, Belgium Summon your musketeers for a getaway to this multiturreted 17th-century chteau in the densely forested Ardennes, once the hunting grounds of France's enfant terrible King Louis XIV. Rooms look the part thanks to bronze busts, floral wallpaper, thick drapery, fireplaces and complimentary carafes of port. And haute cuisine suppers are no less extravagant. Feast on pot-au-feu d'homard and filet de Buf Limousin interspersed with cheese courses and palate cleansers. After dinner, explore the multiple salons. hassonville.be; rooms from $169. Travel + Leisure: Affordable small hotels in Paris bidos Pousada, bidos, Portugal The walled town of bidos is a highlight of many tourist circuits, but only a select few can overnight in the 12th-century castle's plush pousada. The 17 spacious rooms, each named after a king or queen, feature whitewashed walls, four-poster canopied beds and Manueline touches like azulejo-tiled bathrooms and arrow-slit windows with views onto the windmills and vineyards. The restaurant's Portuguese cuisine includes earthy dishes like honey-roasted duck and thyme-infused veal. For those seeking a bit of majestic leisure, the hotel can arrange carriage rides, lake rowing and even hunts. pousadas.pt; from $176. Travel + Leisure: Best hotels in Italy Dornrschenschloss Sababurg, Germany The twin turrets of the enchanted, 675-year-old Dornrschenschloss ("Little Thorny Rose Castle") rise from the surrounding ancient oak forest like an illustration in a fairy tale. It's only fitting as this castle is located on Germany's Fairy Tale Road and claims to be the inspiration of the Brothers Grimm's Legend of Sleeping Beauty, who some say slept here for a century before she was saved by a kiss. It's likely that the brothers did visit this castle, which was then in ruins. Today, a 17-room hotel occupies part of the castle, with canopied beds, cathedral ceilings, stone walls, and of course, extremely comfortable beds. sababurg.de; rooms from $120. Tulloch Castle Hotel, Ross-shire, Scotland Once upon a time, only the chiefs of clans could sleep in such a privileged property. Now this 12th-century castle, 45 minutes' drive from Inverness Airport (and just 28 miles from Loch Ness), is open to all, even a rumored resident ghost. A 250-year-old wood-paneled great hall and trappings like oversize plaid headboards, large drafty fireplaces and a family and pet cemetery -- replete with overgrown scrub and an iron gate -- add to the haunted atmosphere. It's all a fitting tribute to the 20-bedroom castle's windswept Scottish Highland location. bespokehotels.com; rooms from $108. Wartegg Castle, St. Gallen, Switzerland Zita of Bourbon-Parma, the last empress of Austria, once gazed out at Lake Constance from this 16th-century castle where she lived in exile. Today's guests turn up voluntarily to enjoy the picturesque location, staying in modernized accommodations with natural Japanese futons and/or Hsler mattresses on blonde-wood beds, exposed beams and quality Swiss-made Fischbacher bedding. End the day with organic poached pears and Appenzeller cheese and a dip in the historic turquoise bath built in 1928. wartegg.ch; rooms from $160. Leeds Castle, United Kingdom Six queens (including Henry VIII's first wife, Catherine of Aragon) have lived in Leeds Castle, which has stood in Kent, 40 miles southeast of London, since Norman times. Book a room in the Maiden's Tower -- or opt for "Knight's Glamping" and sleep in a colorfully striped medieval-style tent in the vineyard. Four-poster beds and fur throws make the experience more regal than rustic. leeds-castle.com; rooms from $150. Hckeberga Castle, Sweden Located on one of seven small islands in Sweden's Lake Hckeberga district, this castle dates back to the 14th-century, but has been owned only by the Tham family since 1824. The property's farm was once praised in the writings of roving Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, who stayed here in 1749 and called it "the most graceful of all farms in Skne." It remains a favorite of naturalists, who can hike the region's new Linnaeus Trail and spot ravens, white-tailed eagles and red deer in the native beechwood forests before returning to the property for dinner. Salted scallop with melon and pea shoots might be on the menu, or cod fillet with samphire. The property's whiskey hour, a tasting of Mackmyra Swedish spirits, is a fine way to end an evening. enghackebergaslott.sk11.se; rooms from $184. Chteau de Mirambeau, France Like an oenophile's dream home, the 19th-century Renaissance-style Chteau de Mirambeau sits between Bordeaux and Cognac, providing prime opportunities for visits to nearby vineyards. Of the 22 princely accommodations (canopied beds; silk-covered walls; marble baths), rooms in the main castle supply the best views of the surrounding 20-acre private park -- and the pristine Gironde estuary beyond. relaischateaux.com; rooms from $290.

(CNN) -- They're your neighbors, your friends, your colleagues, your parents. They are CNN Heroes, each of whom shows how one person can truly make a difference. Again this year, CNN encourages you to tell us about these everyday people changing the world -- by nominating them at CNNHeroes.com. Taking a few minutes to share their story with us could propel them to worldwide recognition. Maybe someone's selflessness has directly impacted your life. Destiny Bush nominated her mentor and "second mother," Tawanda Jones, whose drill team provides discipline and inspiration to thousands of children in the violent city of Camden, New Jersey. "It was important for the world to see this wonderful individual who commits herself effortlessly -- her heart, her body, her soul -- to our youth," said Bush, now a graduate student. Or maybe you know an individual in your community whose personal story and dedication inspires you. Denada Jackson's mom used to style Robin Emmons' hair. When Jackson bumped into Emmons years later, she learned about Emmons' efforts to help low-income neighborhoods access healthy, fresh food. "It just seemed right that I would nominate her, because I've never seen anyone that happy about helping other people," Jackson said. "She's making it happen for others in her community. Just to watch her be honored for that, to get a thank you, that was awesome." But you don't have to personally know the individual you nominate. Just be familiar with their work. Johanna Robinette, for example, lives in the same small town as Dale Beatty, who helps build and modify homes for injured veterans. Robinette had heard about Beatty's organization, and she saw nominating him as a way to help draw attention to his efforts. "To be able to take that time to do that, I was thankful that I did and thankful that (he was) honored in that way," Robinette said. "It felt great to be a part of that." It's easy to nominate an everyday person changing the world, but a thoughtful, well-written nomination is essential to help yours stand out from the thousands we receive. Here are some suggestions we hope will help you in crafting your nomination for consideration.  Think about what makes your hero special. Ask yourself: What makes my nominee unique? What specific accomplishment has he or she achieved that is truly remarkable? What impact has his or her work had on others? We encourage you to watch videos of previous CNN Heroes to familiarize yourself with the achievements of the inspiring individuals we honor as "everyday people changing the world."  Take a look at our nomination form. We suggest you review the information requested about yourself, your nominee and his or her work before filling out your submission.  Tell us about your hero. Take your time and write from the heart. Remember: What you share -- in your own words -- is the most important factor in advancing a nomination for further consideration. You can enter your answers to the essay questions directly on the form, or write them first in a word-processing document and "cut and paste" them into each answer field. Please note the information you provide will be used in accordance with our privacy policy.  Click "Submit." If your nomination has been successfully transmitted, you'll see a "thank you" message on your screen. If you provided us with your e-mail address, we'll also send a confirmation your nomination has been received. And yes, we read each and every one. That's it. Nominations for 2014 CNN Heroes remain open through August 31, 2014. Frequently Asked Questions Q: Who is eligible to be considered as a CNN Hero

http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/10/us/cnnheroes-leary/index.html	us	Former firefighter rescues pets in disasters - CNN.com	2014/04/10	Thursday Apr 10 06:52:33 EDT 2014	Philadelphia (CNN) -- Hazel Donnelly was taking her husband to the doctor when they got a call that their apartment building was on fire. Her first thought was about her 17-year-old cat, Kramer. "I don't have children on my own, so my cat is like my child. I became hysterical," said Donnelly, 50. "What if (he) didn't make it?" Once she arrived home, Donnelly implored firefighters to get her cat, but they were busy trying to control the blaze. Then Red Paw Emergency Relief arrived. The nonprofit assists pets and their owners when disaster strikes. Jen Leary, a former firefighter who founded the group, met with building residents and, once the fire was out, retrieved the animals. "Everyone who received their pets started to cry," said Donnelly. No one was hurt, but the Donnelly's apartment had severe damage, and they weren't sure where they were going to stay. Donnelly was thrilled to learn that Red Paw could provide free short-term care for Kramer. "When (someone) loses everything in a fire, they shouldn't then be forced to lose their pets -- their family members -- as well," Leary said. "Letting them know, 'We'll take care of your animal like it is our own,' it means the world to people." Since 2011, Leary and her group have provided emergency assistance to nearly 1,000 animals and their families throughout southeastern Pennsylvania. Like the Red Cross, but for animals Several years ago, Leary began working as a firefighter and American Red Cross volunteer. She would often arrive at a disaster scene and see traumatized survivors struggling to care for their pets. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2014 CNN Heroes "They'd ask, 'What am I supposed to do with my dog? Who is going to help find my missing cat? How is my pet going to get medical care?" said Leary, 36. "There just wasn't anyone there to help the other part of the family." Pets were sometimes taken to shelters or abandoned. The situation broke Leary's heart. After a devastating fire in 2011, Leary formed her organization and teamed up with the local chapter of the American Red Cross. Now, whenever the Red Cross responds to a disaster and discovers that an animal is involved, they call Leary. She believes it's the only partnership of its kind in the United States -- one she hopes to replicate in other cities. Always on call Leary's group responds 24 hours a day, seven days a week to residential disasters such as fires, gas leaks and building collapses. Leary answers nearly all the calls herself. Her firefighter background gives her unique privileges. "I'm allowed into situations that other people might not be," Leary said. "Once the fire is out and they're just hitting hot spots, I'll talk to the chief, and if they say it's OK, I'll go in." Rescuing animals is only part of what Red Paw does. Through a network of 400 volunteers, boarding facilities and veterinarians, the group provides emergency transportation, shelter, pet supplies and medical care to any pet involved in a disaster -- all for free. Leary's home is the first stop for most animals that don't need immediate medical care. They usually stay with Leary for a few days while they get vaccinated, spayed and neutered, if necessary. Then they are moved to foster homes until their families are ready to take them back. The group's roster of animals has also included rabbits, ferrets, fish, birds, turtles and other reptiles. Reuniting families Red Paw, which runs on donations, provides care for most animals for around 60 days. The group's caseworkers check in with the owners weekly. When families are reunited with their pets, they receive a kit of supplies. "Food, cat litter, bowls, medicine, whatever they need," said Leary. "We want to make sure that they're starting off the right way." If a family can't take their pet back, the group will find the animal an adoptive home. Red Paw cared for the Donnelly's cat for more than three weeks. "I cried when we were reunited," said Donnelly. "They went above and beyond. I am so grateful." For Leary, helping families and their pets is what her work is all about. "My hope is that it's a fresh start, and they can move forward together," she said. "After going through such a sad thing, it's so good to have a happy ending." Want to get involved?

http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/03/health/cnnheroes-ramirez/index.html	health	Building a healthy community in 'the nation's salad bowl' - CNN.com	2014/04/03	Thursday Apr 3 04:57:13 EDT 2014	Pixley, California (CNN) -- In "the nation's salad bowl," as California's Central Valley is often called, fresh produce grows in abundance. But for many area residents, healthy food is out of reach. "Here we are in this agriculturally rich area and yet people who live here and work here are hungry, are impoverished," said Sarah Ramirez, an educator who grew up in the area. "(Some) are working in the fields that feed the entire country and then they don't have the resources to support them and their health. It's heartbreaking." For the last two years, Ramirez has been on a mission to build a healthier community in her impoverished hometown of Pixley. She and her husband launched Be Healthy Tulare, a grass-roots movement to collect produce that would otherwise go to waste and get it to neighbors in need. The group is named for the county where Pixley is located. "Looking outside and seeing trees just loaded with fruit, I was just feeling like, why aren't we connecting these pieces?" Ramirez said. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2014 CNN Heroes Twice a month, Ramirez and volunteers gather fruit and vegetables from farms and backyard trees. They glean from growers and residents who contact them about their excess produce. The group then provides the bounty to a local food bank that distributes it to families in need. So far this year, Ramirez said, she and her group have collected and donated 20,000 pounds of produce. Connecting the dots Growing up the daughter of farm workers, Ramirez watched her family's health suffer. "In my own family I have witnessed young family members die of preventable diseases," she said. While she was attending college in northern California, she began working at a free health clinic in Sacramento. "I realized that the illnesses and conditions I was seeing there were not that different from what I saw at home. And I began to ask ... why." In Tulare County, 73% of adults are either overweight or obese, according to a recent California Health Interview Survey. Many community members do not own a vehicle or have easy access to public transportation, Ramirez said. The result: People are not getting the quality foods that often grow nearby. "There isn't a full service grocery store that provides the best and most wholesome food at affordable prices here in the community," Ramirez said. While working toward her master's degree and, ultimately, her Ph.D., Ramirez worked part-time as Tulare County's epidemiologist. With a background in public health and cultural studies, she saw the link between food insecurity and the high rates of obesity and diabetes. "I've talked to a lot of people who end up being referred to me ... because they have chronic diseases or their children have chronic diseases," Ramirez said. "I lost count of how many 4-year-olds (I was) seeing with high cholesterol or how many people (came) in due to obesity. I've had moments in the clinic where I have people literally cry because they tell me they can't afford to eat well or eat healthy." When Ramirez set out to help her community, she gathered residents and asked them for their input. By involving them in her efforts, she aims to instill hope and dignity. "We wanted to start a project where the community sees the value of their own experiences," she said. A community of change In addition to salvaging produce, residents learn how to live a healthy life. The group runs a community garden, a fitness program and nutrition classes that Ramirez calls "food labs." "This is an educational opportunity to find out how to use foods we grow in the garden," she said. "I like to have community members offer their own recipes. I welcome the community to teach as well. We want everyone to feel involved." Adults and children participate in the food labs, and generations of families get involved. "Grandma will bring a potluck, and the rest of the family -- and community -- will enjoy the meal," Ramirez said. For Ramirez, it's about creating a sense of belonging and purpose in her community. "It's not about us looking for someone else to come in and save these communities," she said. "It's how we recognize that the people here already matter, that they have value." Want to get involved?

http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/13/us/cnnheroes-carter/index.html	us	Helping women escape 'the life' - CNN.com	2014/03/13	Thursday Mar 13 03:52:36 EDT 2014	St. Paul, Minnesota (CNN) -- As darkness falls, Joy Friedman hits the streets -- the same ones she used to troll for customers while working as a prostitute. "My last trick was turned behind that storefront," she said, gesturing to a nearby building. Now the survivor of sex trafficking cruises these neighborhoods with a different purpose. She's looking for women and girls who are caught up in this lifestyle so she can offer them free condoms and hygiene products. She is also delivering a message: There is help for them if they want it. Friedman works for Breaking Free, a nonprofit that helps women escape prostitution. It's where she got help 13 years ago. "(Prostitution) has been happening forever. And forever, women have just been the victims of it," said Vednita Carter, the organization's founder. "They deserve better." Since 1996, Carter says she has helped more than 6,000 women get the support they need. In the process, she's built an army of survivors who have joined her crusade to end sex trafficking. Lured into 'the life' Carter personally knows about this world. At 18, she was hoping to make money for college when she responded to an advertisement for "dancers." At first, she danced fully clothed, but her bosses and then-boyfriend soon pressured her into stripping and, eventually, prostitution. It was more than a year before Carter called a friend who helped her get back on her feet. Later, she realized how lucky she had been. "The majority of women don't have anyone to call. There is nowhere for them to turn," said Carter, now 60. "That's why I do this work." Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2014 CNN Heroes For many of the women Carter helps, "the life" is all they've known. Studies show that the average age of entry into child prostitution is 12 to 14, and many of the girls have been sexually abused or were runaways. Carter works to educate the public and law enforcement to see these women as victims of sex trafficking rather than as criminals. "Prostitution and sex trafficking really are the same thing. It's about buying and selling a human being," she said. Leaving 'the life' behind Carter says 95% of the women she helps struggle with addiction as well as physical abuse, mental trauma, financial instability and shame. "It's a process. If (they've) been in it forever, it's all they know," she said. "They think it's their destiny." Carter's drop-in center provides food, clothing and emotional support to any woman coming off the street, no strings attached. For many women, the first significant step is to participate in a 14-week class called Sisters of Survival. Graduates are honored in a ceremony, marking the start of their new lives. CNN Money: Inside the underground sex economy "They learn that they do have other choices that (they) can make," Carter said. The group also provides permanent and temporary housing, addiction counseling, job skills training and legal assistance. Most of the staffers who work at Breaking Free are survivors of prostitution, making it one of just a few organizations like it in the United States. "I have a purpose now," Friedman said. "I'm a fighter, and I'm going to fight 'til I die for each and every person involved in sexual exploitation." Fighting the demand  Carter believes that sex trafficking won't end until men stop purchasing sexual favors. She established one of the country's first "John Schools" that educates men arrested for solicitation about the impact of their actions. "I'm not here to make you feel like a piece of sh*t, but you've got to feel something," Doris Johnson, a survivor, told a group back in 2012. "That's somebody's daughter." According to Carter's group, only 2% of the men who complete the course reoffend. Carter is considered by many to be a pioneer in the anti-sex trafficking movement, and she is determined to keep fighting as long as she can. "We are really raising an army here. And this is a battle," she said. "It's not OK to buy and sell us. We are not for sale." Want to get involved? Check out the Breaking Free website at www.breakingfree.net and see how to help.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/world/asia/india-pakistan-talks/index.html	world	India's Modi and Pakistan's Sharif meet, signal steps to rebuild trust - CNN.com	2014/05/27	Tuesday May 27 01:28:34 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif hailed his first one-on-one meeting Tuesday with India's newly elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a "historic opportunity" for the two nations. A firm but simple handshake had sent a message to the world on Monday that the heads of India and Pakistan were ready to talk. And talk they did on Tuesday, in a meeting at Hyderabad House, a former palace in New Delhi, that lasted almost 50 minutes. Briefing reporters after the encounter, Sharif described the meeting as "good and constructive" and "held in warm and cordial atmosphere." Sharif said both countries should work to overcome their mutual mistrust, and that regional peace and stability were key to achieving their common goals of development. Sharif said he intended "pick up the threads" of the Lahore Declaration, referring to a pledge both countries made in 1999 to cooperate more closely to ease tensions. The Pakistani premier also said that accusations and counter-accusations are not productive -- a comment on the regular political back-and-forth between their two nations. "We agreed that our meeting should be a historic opportunity for both our countries," he said. He added that he was "very pleased" to be in New Delhi at Modi's invitation, having flown in for his counterpart's inauguration on Monday. Sharif was part of the biggest gathering of South Asian leaders ever assembled for an Indian prime minister's swearing-in. Emotional response In a series of tweets posted after Monday's inauguration ceremony, Modi revealed the two had exchanged remarks. Sharif "shared some very emotional things," Modi said, before recounting a rather strange story Sharif told him about how his mother became emotional while watching television images of Modi's own mother offering him sweets. In an interview with Indian television station NDTV, Sharif was reported to have described his attendance at Modi's inauguration as a "great opportunity, a great moment." "He said that this strong mandate frees up leaders on both sides ... to actually turn a new page in the history of India and Pakistan," NDTV's Barkha Dutt said. The visuals touched both Nawaz Sharif ji & his Mother. He told me that after seeing the visuals his Mother got very emotional. Long dispute Relations have been strained between the two countries since 1947, the year the Asian subcontinent partitioned into Islamic Pakistan and Hindu-majority India as it gained independence from British rule. In the decades since, they have fought a number of wars and clashed over Kashmir, an 86,000 square-mile region to the north. Efforts to agree a peace deal took a major step back in 2008 when Pakistani militants attacked the Indian city of Mumbai, killing more than 160 people in a series of co-ordinated assaults. In 2011, the two countries agreed to return to the negotiating table and since then relations have continued to thaw. In 2012, former President Asif Ali Zardari became the first Pakistani leader to visit India in seven years. He held talks with then Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who emerged from the 30-minute meeting saying both nations were willing to find "practical and pragmatic" solutions to their differences. Zardari described the talks as "fruitful." Sharif is said to have expressed the same optimism for the countries' relationship in his interview with NDTV on Monday. "Both governments have a strong mandate. This could help in turning a new page in our relations," Sharif told NDTV. "We should remove fears, mistrust and misgivings about each other. Both countries should rid the region of instability and security that has plagued us for decades." Modi's meeting with Sharif is one of a series of bilateral meetings scheduled with regional leaders on his first day as India's 15th prime minister.

Dr. Mehdi Ali Qamar was a cardiologist and resident of Fairfield, Ohio. He arrived in Rabwah town in Punjab three days ago to provide free medical care to heart patients. The doctor was visiting a local graveyard at sunrise Monday when two waiting gunmen shot him and took off, according to Azhar Abbas, a local police official. The motive of the killing is unclear. Qamar died instantly, and pictures of his bloodied body have gone viral on social media. The doctor, who's also a poet and an artist, was visiting the graveyard with his wife and 3-year-old son when the shooting took place. Qamar is a Pakistan native, but has Canadian and U.S. citizenship. He is the second member of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community killed in Pakistan this year. Ahmadiyya Muslim Community members have been constantly persecuted in Pakistan since 1974, when a constitutional amendment declared them non-Muslim. A decade later, President Muhammad Zia ul Haq's military regime amended Pakistan's penal code. This barred Ahmadis from identifying as Muslims and led to a hate campaign against their community. Khalil Ahmad, 61, was arrested on blasphemy charges and fatally shot this month while in police custody in the Punjab town of Sharqpur. He was shot dead by a man who came in to serve food to prison inmates, according to Saleem Uddin, a spokesman for the Ahmadi community. Qamar's family will travel to Canada to bury his body in Toronto. "He had no enemies," the spokesman said. "He was a gentle man who enjoyed playing cricket." "Our community will continue to provide services to this country, It is this ongoing process of hate and discrimination that needs to be stopped in Pakistan."

(CNN) -- The struggle between communism and capitalism defined the second half of the 20th Century. The Cold War pitted east against west, pushing the world to the brink of nuclear war. Now, as we approach the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, which brought the era to a close, CNN International is again airing its 24-part series, The Cold War, which first aired in 1998. Giving unparalleled insight from those who lived and fought through the events that defined an era, The Cold War lets viewers see how the events of yesterday have shaped the world of today. The series was commissioned by CNN founder Ted Turner. Award-winning television director Jeremy Isaacs was the executive producer. The series was narrated by Academy Award nominated actor Sir Kenneth Branagh. The programs will air on CNN International every two weeks starting on January 4. Here is a summary of the first 12 episodes. 1 "Comrades" 1917--1945  
(January 4 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and January 5 at 02:00 GMT) The Russian Revolution of 1917, followed by the Russian Civil War caused a rift between the Soviet Union and the United States. But when President Franklin Roosevelt took office in 1933, diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries resumed. The relationship was strained yet again after the USSR annexed the Baltic States and signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany. Despite their differences the Soviet Union and the United States found themselves allied after the German invasion of Russia in June 1941. As the war in Europe began to wind down and victory was in sight, the two countries had very different views as to what the post-war world would look like. At the Potsdam Conference, just before the atom bomb was dropped on Japan, it became clear that Stalin wanted to put Eastern Europe under the Soviet sphere of influence, setting the conditions for the Cold War to commence. Episode 1 includes interviews from George F. Kennan, Zoya Zarubina, Hugh Lunghi and George Elsey. 2 "Iron Curtain" 1945--1947  
(January 18 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and January 19 at 02:00 GMT) As wartime turned to peacetime, a resurgent United States enjoys economic prosperity while Europe is left to recover from the ravages of war. In the Soviet Union, Stalin has resumed his feared purges and the country is gripped by famine. Germany is forced to cede some of its eastern territory to Poland, and the Germans living in that area are expelled from their homes. Stalin begins to increase his hold on Eastern Europe, installing communist regimes, but decides to stay out of the Greek Civil War. The United Kingdom, exhausted from the war, sees its once-powerful empire go into decline. As food shortages begin to threaten the stability of Europe, a more assertive United States begins to challenge the USSR's influence in both Turkey and Iran. Episode 2 includes interviews from Lord Annan, Sir Frank Roberts and Paul Nitze. 3 "Marshall Plan" 1947--1952  
(February 1 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and February 2 at 02:00 GMT) For both selfless and selfish reasons, the United States institutes the Marshall Plan, giving massive amounts of aid to the war-ravaged countries of Europe. Suspicious of American intentions, Stalin prevents countries in the Soviet sphere from taking part in the plan. As a counter to the U.S. plan, Stalin established the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. In Czechoslovakia, communists seize power in a 1948 coup. While Yugoslav leader Marshal Tito was originally allied with the Soviet Union, he decides to forge his own foreign policy path and accepts aid from the Marshall Plan. After the 1948 Italian elections, the CIA and Catholic Church conspire to push the communist party there from power. The Marshall Plan successfully modernizes Western Europe and strengthens its ties to the United States. Interviewees from episode 3 include Vladimir Yerofeyev, Gianni Agnelli and Giulio Andreotti. 4. "Berlin" 1948--1949  
(February 15 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and February 16 at 02:00 GMT) Opposed by the USSR, the United States emphasizes the need to rebuild the German economy. With the introduction of the Deutsche Mark, the Soviets react by tightening checkpoints leading into the French, British, and American sectors of Berlin, ultimately leading to a ground blockade of the city. To keep the city from starvation, the western allies begin the Berlin Airlift, ferrying in supplies by plane. German Communists in Berlin successfully take over the city's municipal government, which causes both the city and country to be divided between east and west. Interviews in Episode 4 include Gail Halvorsen, Sir Freddie Laker and Clark Clifford. 5. "Korea" 1949--1953  
(March 1 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and March 2 at 02:00 GMT) Korea was split between the United States and the Soviet Union at the end of World War Two. The Soviets install Kim Il-sung as the leader of the north, while the Americans place Syngman Rhee at the head of the south. In 1950, with the help of the Soviets, North Korea invades South Korea, pushing U.S. and South Korean forces to a city at the southern tip of the Korean peninsula, called Pusan. In response to the invasion, a United Nations force, led by the United States, regains the advantage, driving the communist forces towards the Chinese border. Feeling threatened, and at Stalin's behest, Chinese leader Mao Zedong attacks. This leads to a stalemate in the center of Korea. After protracted negotiations, an armistice is signed. Communism in Korea is contained, but the country is left divided. Interviews in Episode 5 include Lucius D. Battle, Paik Sun Yup and John Glenn. 6. "Reds" 1948--1953  
(March 15 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and March 16 at 02:00 GMT) Fear of one another permeates the eastern and western leadership, trickling down to the citizenry. The House Committee on Un-American Activities in the United States begins investigating alleged communist infiltration in the entertainment industry and diplomatic corps. In the USSR, an increasing cult of personality is being built up around Stalin and a more repressive police state is taking hold. In response to Yugoslavia's independent foreign policy, the Soviet Union pushes a series of purges in Prague as a warning to other satellite countries that may stray from Soviet policy. Fear and repression in the USSR hits its zenith right before Stalin's sudden death in 1953. Interviews in Episode 6 include Arthur Kinoy, Ralph de Toledano and Boris Pokrovsky. 7. "After Stalin" 1953--1956  
(March 29 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and March 30 at 02:00 GMT) After Stalin's sudden death, Nikita Khrushchev takes over the Soviet Union, reversing some of Stalin's oppressive policies. Khrushchev also reestablishes relations with Yugoslavia and in a secret speech given to the Soviet leadership he denounces Stalin's harsh policies. Meanwhile, West Germany begins to rearm, leading the USSR to establish the Warsaw Pact in response. Trying to maintain Soviet influence in Eastern Europe, Khrushchev sends troops into East Germany, Poland, and Hungary to put down revolts. Interviews in Episode 7 include Anatoly Dobrynin, Charles Wheeler and Sergei Khrushchev. 8. "Sputnik" 1949--1961  
(April 5 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and April 6 at 02:00 GMT) Unbeknown to the United States, the Soviets had spied on the U.S. development of the atom bomb, and quickly created their own after the Second World War. This sparked a nuclear arms race between the two superpowers. With the successful Soviet launch of Sputnik, America responds by increasing its development of nuclear armed missiles. A fear takes hold in the United States that the nation is falling behind the Soviets in terms of technology. John F. Kennedy is elected President of the United States in 1960, as the Soviets seem to have a commanding head start in the space race. Interviews in Episode 8 include Joseph Rotblat, Boris Chertok, Andrew Goodpaster, Herbert York and Gherman Titov. 9. "The Wall" 1958--1963  
(April 19 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and April 20 at 02:00 GMT) As West Germany and West Berlin become more affluent, East Germans begin to flee their country for their more prosperous neighbor. Khrushchev demands that the British, French, and Americans leave West Berlin, but they decline and the opportunity for a peaceful resolution is dashed when the Soviets walk out on the Paris Summit of 1960 because of the U-2 incident. On the night of August 12, 1962, East German security forces begin to build the Berlin Wall. In response, a tense standoff between U.S. and Soviet forces ensues. In 1963, President Kennedy delivers his famous "I am a Berliner" speech. Interviews in Episode 9 include Anatoly Gribkov, Valentin Falin, Stefan Heym, Egon Bahr, Raymond L. Garthoff and Conrad Schumann. 10. "Cuba" 1959--1962  
(May 3 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and May 4 at 02:00 GMT) Fidel Castro seizes power as a result of the Cuban Revolution and becomes an ally of the Soviet Union. He begins to nationalize American assets in Cuba, which leads to the United States introducing an economic boycott of the island nation. The United States sponsors a failed counter revolution on the island with the Bay of Pigs Invasion. The Soviet Union begins to move medium range nuclear missiles into Cuba which sparks the Cuban Missile Crisis. The crisis leads to a U.S. blockade of Cuba, and a near war with the Soviet Union. The crisis ends after secret negotiations between the United States and USSR lead to a deal to remove American missiles from Turkey and Soviet missiles from Cuba. Interviews in Episode 10 include Fidel Castro, Walter Cronkite, Pierre Salinger and Theodore Sorensen. 11. "Vietnam" 1954--1968  
(May 17 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and May 18 at 02:00 GMT) Vietnam's former colonial ruler, France, was forced out of the country after losing the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. Refugees began to flood into South Vietnam from the north, after communists there began a strict land reform program. The Viet Cong, with Soviet help, tries to reunify the country through force. America, supporting South Vietnam, becomes more involved after the Gulf of Tonkin incident. As American casualties continue to grow, so does the unpopularity of a war that seems unlikely to be won. After the Tet Offensive, President Lyndon Johnson's clout is severely damaged. A policy of bombing North Vietnam, while also seeking to negotiate a peace, does not work. Interviews for Episode 11 include Robert Macnamara, William Westmoreland, Nguyen Vo Giap, Bui Diem, Jack Valenti and Clark Clifford. 12. "MAD" 1960--1972 (May 31 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and June 1 at 02:00 GMT) America's policy of targeting Soviet military bases as a deterrent to war is shown to be ineffective during the Cuban Missile Crisis. A new deterrent policy is thought up by U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, called MAD, or Mutually Assured Destruction. Both Americans and Soviets begin testing and building more nuclear weapons, including submarines that are able to strike should one side destroy the other. Adopting a defensive strategy, the Soviets create an anti-ballistic missile. The United States develops multiple independent warheads to counter this. The danger of the arms race is shown in the Palomares incident. Yet there is some hope of de-escalation after both sides sign the SALT Treaty. Interviews in Episode 12 include Russell E. Dougherty, William Kaufmann and Harold Brown.

(CNN) -- Africa is a land under construction. Last year, over $220 billion was spent on all kinds of building projects in the continent. While foreign architects have clamored to make their mark in the region, a range of local talent has also stepped forward to shape their landscape (and in some cases, export their aesthetic abroad). "Africa is constantly looking to the North. It doesn't always look in its own backyard, but the truth is, there's a lot of very good indigenous knowledge on the continent," says Iain Low, a professor of architecture at the University of Cape Town and editor the South African edition of Architectural Digest. In celebration of that knowledge, we take a look at some of Africa's most exciting contemporary architects. David Adjaye Born in Tanzania, "starchitect" David Adjaye is the son of a Ghanaian diplomat and spent his childhood traveling the globe before settling in Britain at the age of nine. The multi-award winning architect (he has scooped up numerous accolades from both the Royal Institute of British Architects and the American Institute of Architects) has been tapped for a number of high-profile projects over the years, most recently the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC and the Mass Extinction Memorial Observatory in the Isle of Portland, England. Though Adjaye's projects span the globe, he has numerous projects in Africa, including designing the Princes Town resort, in Ghana. In 2012, he opened an office in Ghana's capital, Accra. Kunle Adeyemi Kunle Adeyemi, the Nigerian-born founder of NLE Architects, made waves last year with the completion of one of his designs: a floating, three-story A-frame school built in Makoko, a slum on the waterfront of Lagos, Nigeria. Bobbing on top of about 250 empty barrels, the school is designed to avoid many of the problems associated with frequently rising water levels. The structure is also green: it makes use of rainwater collection, and solar panels provide the electricity. Though the school accommodates a mere 100 elementary school children, it has potential to act as a model for water-bound communities the world over. "It didn't start as a big idea, I was trying to solve a small problem the community had. I realized the problem I was trying to solve was a problem for a larger part of the world," Adeymi told CNN last year. "We're now seeing people take interest in this across Africa." Read: Africa's hotshot photographers Diebedo Francis Kere Diebedo Francis Kere's humble beginnings in the small village of Gando, Burkina Faso, have granted him a useful alternate perspective on the architectural needs of his countrymen. "Kere is deeply grounded in the values of African society," says Low. "He's really the one person trying to transcend tradition and find a new kind of direction that locates architecture within the global self." Though his firm, Kere Architecture, is based in Berlin, he is also committed to reinvesting his knowledge back into his home country. Burkina Faso's landscape is dotted with schools he designed -- a revolutionary approach that replaces concrete with earth bricks and employs a corrugated steel roof that is raised to allow air for better circulation. The idea is twofold: firstly, a cooler classroom will help improve the student's concentration. Secondly, by employing local materials and labor, Kere helps empower the local community. His efforts have earned him a series of awards, including the prestigious Aga Khan Award for Architecture. Mokena Makeka For Cape Town architect Mokena Makeka, design is not merely aesthetic; it's democratizing. In both his redesign of the Railway Police Station and the Cape Town Railway Station, Makeka has been significant in putting forth a post-apartheid aesthetic (for example, for the railway station he removed the two separate entrances that -- during the apartheid era -- had been used used to segregate black and white passengers). Makeka Design Lab, of which Makeka is the principal and founder, has been the recipient of several awards, including two Merit Awards from the Cape Institute for Architecture. Though Cape Town is still very close to Makeka's heart, he dreams of having international influence as well. In 2008, he was part of the prestigious Ordos 100 (Herzog & de Meuron handpicked 100 architects globally to put forth designs for the industrial Chinese city). Y Tsai Heading up the Y Tsai Design Studio, Cape Town architect Y Tsai also believes in using architecture as a means of social reform. In 2012, he won a Loerie Award for converting an old shipping container into a classroom in rural South Africa. The colorful classroom featured an outdoor jungle gym, windows to allow for cross ventilation, a steel roof that can collect rain water, and an outdoor amphitheater for school events. "Tsai does a lot of really interesting, innovative work with containers," notes Low. Read this: Africa's hottest new fashion designers Mick Pearce Zimbabwean architect Mick Pearce is a leader when it comes to environmental design. His mission has always been to create buildings that are not only sustainable, but low-maintenance, low-cost and which blend into their natural surroundings. Nature is often a great source of inspiration for Pearce. One of his best-known buildings, for instance, the Eastgate Shopping Center in Harare, Zimbabwe, employed a sustainable temperature control system, using tubes in the walls to move air through the building, based on the system employed by termites. He used a similar model for CH2, a mixed-use development in Melbourne, Australia. SAOTA Cape Town-based SAOTA -- manned by partners Stefan Antoni, Philip Olmesdahl and Greg Truen -- has become synonymous with sleek, contemporary, high-end design. The firm does a good business in high-end resorts, swank private residences and glimmering commercial centers. "Their architecture is very glam, very Wallpaper-ish," says Low. "They have built for a lot of African clients, mainly the elite." The studio, which has a team of 90 designers and technicians, an in-house CGI team and a branch dedicated to furniture and interior design, has pulled in a slew of awards. Most recently, they won an Award of Excellence and an Award of Merit from the South African Institute of Architects for a vacation house in Voelklip, in the Western Cape, a luxurious residence with a large garden and courtyard pool that measures a mere 45-feet wide. Nina Cohen and Fiona Garson South African architects Nina Cohen and Fiona Garson could very well be in line for some awards this year for renovating a former gas station, car dealership and dental school into the Wits Art Museum, according to Low: "They turned it into something beautiful and poetic," he says.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/23/tech/innovation/the-smog-guzzling-buildings-pollution/index.html	tech	The smog-guzzling buildings fighting deadly pollution - CNN.com	2014/05/23	Friday May 23 05:31:03 EDT 2014	Vital Signs is a monthly program bringing viewers health stories from around the world. (CNN) -- Air pollution is now the biggest global environmental killer, the WHO has confirmed. The seven million deaths it caused in 2012 exceeded the victims of cigarettes, and is more than double previous estimates. Air pollution in over half of 1,600 cities surveyed is now above safe limits of Particulate Matter (PM), with the highest cost borne by the poorer regions of South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. In Delhi, found to have the worst pollution in the world, around 10,000 people die prematurely each year because of pollution. Most of these perish through strokes, heart conditions, and cancer, and the issues are multiplying. "We are now seeing a large number of lung impairments and respiratory problems among children," says Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of the Clean Air Program at India's Center for Science and Environment. "There is a strong correlation with emergency hospitalizations in winter when the pollution is high." Read this: Top 20 most polluted cities in the world High-tech solutions But although there is widespread agreement that restricting emissions is an effective solution, badly affected cities are increasingly turning to technological solutions. The Manuel Gea Gonzlez Hospital in Mexico City unveiled a "smog-eating" facade last year, covering 2,500 square meters with a titanium dioxide coating that reacts with light to neutralize elements of air pollution. Designers claim it negates the effects of 1,000 cars each day. An even grander project, the Palazzo Italia, will use similar materials over 13,000 square meters across six floors when it opens in Milan in 2015. Dutch scientists have also adapted the system to roads, claiming this can reduce pollution by 45%. The material is not prohibitively expensive -- adding as little as 4-5% to construction costs. But the impact of such buildings has been limited to their immediate location, and efforts to develop the concept have led to more novel, personalized solutions. The first pollution-eating poem appeared this May in Sheffield, England, a 20-meter banner of Simon Armitage's "In Praise of Air," coated with titanium dioxide nano-particles that can counteract around 20 cars' worth of pollution each day. While it is a creative tool for promoting a local poetry festival, it also serves as proof of concept that the technology can be incorporated into practically any textile, and will be reproduced on several more banners and posters in the coming months. But the ultimate goal is to render us all air-purifying units. The poem is an offshoot of Catalytic Clothing, a collaboration between designer Helen Storey and polymer chemist Tony Ryan that aims to incorporate titanium dioxide nano-particles into laundry detergent, so that our outfits are coated. "Clothes are the way to do it because they are ubiquitous," says Ryan. "In the city of Sheffield we need to get rid of 1,000 tons of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) each year to comply with air quality regulations, which is around three tons per day." The concept relies on mass participation. Ryan says that one person wearing clothes washed in the detergent could remove 5-6 grams of NO2 from the air every day -- which means Sheffield's population of just over half a million could collectively enable the city to meet its NO2 target. Read: This machine makes drinking water from thin air One drawback is that the laundered material would not distinguish between atmospheric impurities, so that expensive perfume would be neutralized as well as smog, which has been an issue for manufacturers. There have also been suggestions that the particles could be an irritant, although Ryan -- who has been testing the product on himself -- denies this. Personal protection A more immediate, easier option is becoming available through a personal pollution monitor. The MicroPEM sensor developed by the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) picks up a range of exposure data to help the user manage risk. Early trials have focused on detecting indoor pollution from cook stoves in the developing world, which account for over two million deaths per year through exposure to toxic smoke, most commonly through respiratory diseases. But the device could be applied to a wide range of environments, to indicate a wide range of health threats. "For many diseases we haven't determined whether one component (of pollution) is more causal than another," says lead developer and RTI environmental exposure expert Dr. Charles Rodes. "But this can measure for diseases with rapid responses like asthma or pulmonary disease where it doesn't have to be specific, we just measure total exposure to particles of a certain size (PM)." In the case of asthma, among the most common pollution-related conditions, an attack can follow soon after exposure, and early warning can save lives. Rodes believes a personalized approach to monitoring can reach the people most vulnerable to air pollution better than stationary systems. "It's the intersection between the most exposed and the most susceptible that tells you most about the environmental threat -- and personal level measurement is about the only way to find out." The scientist is confident that the technology is moving from the lab environment toward public availability, following trials at academic institutions in the United States, United Kingdom and China. The units currently cost around $2,000 but will come down with demand, although there may be trade-offs to make it accessible. "If you want something that's easy to use it tends not to be as accurate or specific," says Rodes. Nonetheless, its makers claim the MicroPEM will be the most sophisticated mobile pollution measurement tool available. While smartphone apps are proliferating, their functions are basic. Knowledge is power Biomimicry could also provide a meaningful sensor. Zoologist Dr. Fritz Vollrath of the University of Oxford has worked with spiders to draw inspiration from their materials and methods, and believes the sensitivity of their webs is unsurpassed. "The thinness and electrical charge of the fibers allows them to catch any particles flying through the air, and the liquid coating is like a glue (that binds them)," says Vollrath. The web is sensitive enough to capture "individual spores and atoms." Vollrath believes a synthesized silk web would be a perfect tool for capture and measurement of pollutants, to reveal the extent of danger in the atmosphere. This could be tested by a chemical probe to provide a detailed breakdown of what has been caught. He envisages such a web could be used anywhere from disaster zones to hospitals and homes -- "a mesh near the source of pollution -- such as over the chimney." His concepts are already being realized. Crowdsourcing and citizen science are also offering solutions. Chinese innovators launched the FLOAT project that gave concerned citizens the chance to take air quality readings using pollution-sensing kites, and then submit the results to a database for findings to be shared. Similar citizen alliances are taking to the skies from London to Philadelphia. For all the futuristic possibilities, this may be the most effective action citizens can take. "Putting data out means more accountability," says Dr. Carlos Dora, Coordinator of Interventions for Healthy Environment at the WHO, pointing out that governments can reverse the effects of pollution if they are committed -- such as in Berlin, where private cars have been restricted in some areas, or Beijing, where factories scaled down for the 2008 Olympics, triggering a marked improvement in air quality.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/20/world/europe/russian-billionaire-dmitry-rybolovlev-divorce/index.html	world	Divorce reportedly costs Russian oligarch $4.5 billion, with a B - CNN.com	2014/05/20	Tuesday May 20 12:03:19 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- It's being called the most expensive divorce in the history of ... well, marriage. Russia's Dmitry Rybolovlev, 47, earned the dubious honor when Geneva, Switzerland's Court of First Instance last week ordered the 47-year-old billionaire to pay his wife, Elena, about 4 billion Swiss francs, according to CNN's French affiliate BFM. That's a little more than $4.5 billion (little being a relative term). The couple was married for 23 years but have been engaged in divorce proceedings since 2008, BFM reported, citing the Swiss daily newspaper Le Temps. Rybolovlev, who owns the French soccer team AS Monaco, which finished second in Ligue 1 this season, is No. 148 on Forbes' list of billionaires. His estimated worth is $8.8 billion, according to Forbes. Known lately for real estate moves -- including the purchases of a $300 million penthouse in Monaco and a $98 million Palm Beach, Florida, mansion owned by Donald Trump, along with his daughter's purchases of an $88 million New York apartment and the Greek island of Skorpios -- Rybolovlev made his original fortune in fertilizer, according to Forbes. He and his father, a scientist, started their business in 1990, and Rybolovlev began buying shares of industrial enterprises in 1992, Forbes reported. In 1995, he was named chairman of the board of Uralkali, Russia's top producer of potassium fertilizers, Forbes said. He sold his stake in Uralkali for $6.5 billion in 2010 and procured a controlling stake in AS Monaco the following year. The divorce puts Rybolovlev in rarefied company, as only French businessman and art dealer Alec Wildenstein and Bernie Ecclestone, the top dog in Formula One racing, have been reported to shell out more than $1 billion in divorce proceedings. 11 intriguing things owned by wealthy Russians World's 'most expensive divorce' set to halve oligarch's fortune CNN's Tara Kangarlou contributed to this report. 
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/14/world/asia/japan-casinos/index.html	world	Is Japan betting big on casinos? - CNN.com	2014/05/14	Wednesday May 14 09:57:04 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- While Japan's economy continues to falter, lawmakers are betting big that the casino industry can swoop in and lift it out of the doldrums. Gambling is currently illegal in Japan, though many play pachinko, a quintessentially Japanese game often likened to pinball. While cash prizes are forbidden, many pachinko parlors work on a gray economy where prizes are exchanged -- off-premises -- for hard currency. This week, a major conference focusing on the future of the industry opened in Tokyo. It comes at a time when key legislation is being pushed through Japan's parliament that could pave the way for the development of a large-scale gaming industry in the country. "There is ample chance that the bill will be debated in parliament (this session) and will be passed by both houses," said Toru Mihara, Director of the Institute of Amusement Industry Studies, Osaka University of Commerce and a key speaker at this week's Japan Gaming Congress. Tokyo, along with Japan's second city, Osaka, is being eyed as a key destination for so-called "Integrated Resorts" (IR), which would combine casinos with hotel, luxury retail and entertainment complexes. The industry has the potential to generate tens of billions of dollars for Japan, attracting massive investment from overseas -- in particular from Las Vegas-based companies and Asian gaming operators -- and boosting its tourism numbers. The next Singapore? "The easy comparison to make is with the Singapore market," said Michael Paladino, Gaming, Lodging & Leisure Sector Head at Fitch Ratings. "The success of the Singapore market and its ability to generate non-gaming revenues, much more so than the Macau market. That is a lot easier to sell politically. Tourism creates the meetings, incentives and retail. Everything else that comes with it aside from gambling." Part of the urgency in getting the legislation ratified in this Diet session comes from the desire to keep the gaming project concurrent with the opening of the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. "The government is looking at the Olympics and IR as a one- two in terms of elevating Japan's tourism presence and then really going after foreign inbound visitors," Grant Govertsen, principal and analyst at Union Gaming Research Macau, told CNN. "Inbound foreign visitation is fairly anemic on an annual basis for such a developed and interesting country. I think that's the key there. It has nothing to do with economics -- using IRs as a means to help fund Olympics development." With casinos opening up across Asia, from new developments in Cambodia and the Philippines to Korea, Singapore and China's gambling mecca Macau, eyes are firmly fixed on this side of the world for the industry's expansion. Japan is seen as a huge untapped market and one which, unlike Macau for example, would not be heavily reliant on inbound tourism to fulfill its potential. Homegrown crowd Much of the investment interest is pegged on Japanese gamblers flocking to their own casinos -- Mihara suggests that upwards of 80% of Japanese casinos visitors could be locals, and this stable, relatively disposable income-rich market is certainly a selling point, as it is likely that the region's biggest gambling market may choose to shun Japanese casinos. Historical and cultural tensions between China and Japan -- Japanese aggression during the Second World War remains a highly political issue across much of Asia -- may dampen Chinese enthusiasm for Japanese travel. "We will not be too dependent on Chinese, like Macau," said Mihara. "Given the political relationship, there is a potential risk (if Japanese casinos were too dependent on Mainland visitors)." The strength of the domestic market could have a knock-on effect to other gaming destinations in the region, particularly South Korea, which could see a drop-off in Japanese gamblers traveling overseas. Untapped potential The interest from casino companies -- Las Vegas-based companies like Sands but also Asian operators -- is palpable. The bidding process, which will begin if and when the law is passed, will lead to potentially the most expensive resorts ever built, with some figures suggesting anything up to a $10 billion investment. The numbers involved in Japan are much higher than they are elsewhere in Asia, largely due to the high price of land. Nonetheless, the opportunity to break into a new market is seemingly too tempting to resist. "It will be highly sought after from all the major global players, as (potentially) the second-largest market in Asia, from a gaming revenue point," said Paladino. Given potentially low returns, thanks to eyewatering capital expenditure including land and construction costs and higher wages, along with a potentially more punitive tax climate than neighboring countries, the risk that gaming operations are taking on appear to be higher. "You're going to have to spend a lot more money to get the same amount of casino, it is not clear that the return profile will be as good as Macau or Singapore, but it could very well be," said Govertsen. Pachinko threatened? Analysts are divided on whether the influx of gaming tables will affect the pachinko industry, which has seen the development of thousands of parlors dotted across the country. Regardless, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party -- along with a handy majority of cross-party support -- sees the arrival of legalized gambling in Japan as a boon for the country's coffers. "Clearly, there can be a significant economic stimulus associated with the development of IR," said Govertsen. "From a taxing and jobs perspective, it could meaningful for Japan."

You can now add the "anti-loneliness" Moomin House Cafe to the menagerie of "wait, what?" strokes of Japanese brilliance. We first wrote about the Moomin House Cafe in 2012, but the cafe went viral a few weeks ago and has since been besieged with customers wanting a taste of its "anti-loneliness" magic. CNN's Yuki Arawaka paid a visit (see gallery photos) following the cafe's new surge in popularity. To save its lone customers from the awkward perils of solo dining, the cafe kindly seats diners with stuffed animal companions called Moomins, a family of white hippo-like characters created by Finnish illustrator and writer Tove Jansson. Moomins are brought to each table so that patrons -- solo or in groups -- can have a turn sitting with them. Weekday mornings are the quietest time, while weekends are packed all day long. Sukiyabashi Jiro: The world's best sushi bar Respecting Moomin culture To honor the characters' heritage, Moomin House Cafe serves bread made from Finnish rye, and offers food and pastries in the form of Moomin characters. Cafe staff say there have been long lines almost every day since its "lonely-friendly" concept went viral. It's a long overdue turn in the spotlight -- the cafe has been open since 2003. There are now three Moomin Cafe locations in Japan -- the Tokyo Dome location is especially popular with Dome concert goers. Beloved for their whimsical adventures and diverse array of characters, Moomins are celebrated in their home country of Finland and anime-obsessed Japan. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of their creator, Tove Jansson, who was born in 1914 and died in 2001. A Moomin theme park is a popular destination in Finland. Another one is slated to open next year in Japan.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/13/world/americas/christopher-columbus-santa-maria/index.html	world	Wreck off Haiti may be Christopher Columbus' flagship Santa Maria - CNN.com	2014/05/13	Tuesday May 13 01:58:37 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Is a sunken shipwreck off Haiti the long-lost remains of the Santa Maria, Christopher Columbus' flagship from his first voyage to the Americas? Underwater explorer Barry Clifford, who led a team that found and investigated the wreck, says he's confident it is. "Every single piece fits. Now, of course, we have to go through the whole archeological process, and we plan to do that within the next few months, but I feel very confident that we've discovered the site," he told CNN. "This is the ship that changed the course of human history," Clifford said. If the claim is confirmed, it would go down as one of the most significant underwater archaeological discoveries ever. "It is the Mount Everest of shipwrecks for me," said Clifford, 68. But it isn't a new find for him. Clifford's announcement involves a wreck he and his team investigated in 2003. A cannon was found as part of the wreck. But, Clifford told CNN, archaeologists at the time "misdiagnosed" the cannon. Two years ago, after having researched the type of cannon used in Columbus' time, "I woke up in the middle of the night and said, 'Oh my God,' " Clifford told CNN. He realized the 2003 find might have been the one. A couple of weeks ago, he returned to the wreck with a group of experts. The team measured and photographed the ship. But some items, including the cannon, had been looted from the ship in the intervening years, Clifford said. The ship "still has attributes that warrant an excavation to determine the site's identity," archaeologist Charles Beeker of Indiana University said Tuesday. "Barry may have finally discovered the 1492 Santa Maria." The evidence, Beeker said, is "very compelling." The ship was found in the exact area where Columbus said the Santa Maria ran aground more than 500 years ago, Clifford said. The wreck is stuck on a reef off Haiti's northern coast, 10 to 15 feet beneath the water's surface. Clifford plans to go back to Haiti next month to meet with authorities and decide what steps to take next. Wrecked in 1492 It was the flagship of Columbus' small fleet that set sail from Spain in August 1492 under the sponsorship of King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella I. The voyage aimed to find a westward route to China, India and the gold and spice islands of the East. But the land the sailors set eyes on in October 1492 was an island in the Caribbean. Among the islands on which Columbus set foot was Hispaniola, which is divided between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Columbus established a fort in Haiti. That December, the Santa Maria accidentally ran aground off the island's coast. Some planks and provisions from the wrecked ship, which was about 117 feet (36 meters) long, were used by the garrison at the fort, according to Encyclopaedia Britannica. Columbus set off back to Spain with the two remaining ships, the Nina and the Pinta, in January 1493. Archaeological study needed Archaeologists will have to excavate and examine the ship found off Haiti in order to determine whether it is, in fact, the Santa Maria. Most of the ship is in shape and will be possible to excavate with the help of the Haitian government, said Clifford, who made a name for himself salvaging pirate ships off the coasts of Cape Cod and Madagascar. His team has used sophisticated metal detectors and sonar scans to study the remains. The ship is the right size, he said, and stones found at the site match the kind from the part of Spain where the ship was built. "I don't think any of us should take for granted what has been written," Clifford said. "This is a tremendous touchstone to that period in time. We don't know what secrets are going to be held on the ship." Did Phoenicians beat Columbus by 2,000 years?

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/13/world/can-art-really-get-any-more-expensive/index.html	world	Can art really get any more expensive? - CNN.com	2014/05/13	Tuesday May 13 07:14:08 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- When Christie's launches the latest auction at its New York showroom this evening, gavels will fall. Prices, however, will almost certainly rise ... and rise. For its Post-war Masters and Contemporary Evening Sale, one of this year's headline art auctions, Christie's has on offer masterpieces including Francis Bacon's Three Studies for a Portrait of John Edwards, Gerhard Richter's Abstraktes Bild (712), and Mark Rothko's Untitled during a night expected to fetch well north of $200 million. Christie's estimates that the Richter work will command a price of between $22 and $28 million, the Rothko between $40 and $60 million, and the Bacon triptych around $80 million. The house has reason to be upbeat with its estimates. On May 12, during an auction titled "If I Live I'll See You Tuesday," buyers from 26 countries splashed out on contemporary works by artists including Jean-Michel Basquiat, Jeff Koons and Richard Prince. Christie's sold $134.6 million of art in an hour. Speaking to journalists after the show, Christie's Chief Executive Officer Steven Murphy suggested that buyers from emerging markets are helping keep the market vibrant. "The number of people around the world interested in acquiring art at all levels is exploding," he said. "We are not in a bubble." Viola Raikhel-Bolot, the director of global art advisory firm 1858 Ltd Art Advisory, believes international buyers will turn out en masse for tonight's auction. "The place to buy post-war and contemporary art seems to remain New York," she says. "Collectors from Latin America and Asia frequent the galleries here and follow these sales very closely." Read "The dark side of creativity: Depression + anxiety x madness = genius?" Boom times In recent years sales of fine art have trended in one direction: up. According to the annual report of the European Fine Art Fair, global sales of fine art and antiques jumped 7.5% in 2013 to $65.5 billion, just under the all-time high set in 2007. This includes auction sales and estimates of anonymous sales. In 2013, Christie's tallied more than $7 billion in sales, breaking its own record for the fourth consecutive year. In November 2013, a Christie's auction in New York brought in $782,368,375, the highest auction series in art market history. Jeff Koons's Balloon Dog sold for $58.4 million, making it the most valuable work sold at auction by a living artist and at the same auction, Francis Bacon's triptych of Lucian Feud, sold for $142 million. Andrew Renton, director of London's Marlborough Contemporary gallery and a professor of curating at Goldsmiths College at the University of London, points out that there are many more deals going on in private, and that some likely outstrip existing records. "We've got an economic model which is slightly contradictory," Renton says. "Prices seem to set the value. Overpaying is almost the best thing you can do, because you start to define your own market." But this isn't a free-for-all. He believes buyers with deep pockets want superlative works that delve into our psyche. "Bacon works on that model," he says. "He gets into the soul of the anxious human being. And in Rothko the abstraction is a reflection of the darkness and the contemporary condition. "People talk about these things in monetary terms. You don't get to that monetary value unless there is a correlation with cultural value." As classic works become more scarce, their value will continue to rise -- as will the hoopla surrounding them. "I do not believe there is a price ceiling," Renton says. "In our lifetime we will see a billion dollar work of art."  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/world/europe/france-migrants/index.html	world	Camps dismantled after French police standoff with migrants in Calais - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 07:30:45 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Police in northern France moved in Wednesday on makeshift migrant camps near the port of Calais, prompting a standoff with the defiant residents -- many of whom have fled conflicts in Syria, Sudan and Eritrea. By late afternoon, a CNN producer observed that the migrants' tents had all been destroyed. One activist told CNN police were responsible. About a dozen police officers remained, along with 50 to 60 migrants who didn't know where to go. A local prefect reportedly told the migrants they can stay at the camp until Thursday. But Thursday is Ascension Day, a public holiday, so it's not clear if the migrants will be cleared out before Friday. Hundreds of migrants had gathered in the ramshackle camps, some seeking to claim asylum in France and others hoping to find a way to reach British soil. Mattheu Adt of international humanitarian organization Medecins du Monde, told CNN from one of the camps that police had asked the migrants to move to an undisclosed location, but that the migrants were refusing. Authorities also asked the migrants to shower and decontaminate their clothes, amid concern over an outbreak of the contagious skin condition, scabies, he said. Migrants refused to do that, Adt said, because of concerns their tattered tents would be gone when they returned. "They fear they will be arrested at the showers," said Ccile Bossy, an activist with Medecins du Monde. She said migrants were given scabies medication Tuesday night but didn't understand what it was for. Adt said the makeshift camp where he is located housed about 600 people, roughly half of them Syrian, and between 200 and 300 Eritrean and Sudanese. A spokesman for the charity Secours Catholique in Calais confirmed that police had arrived at about 6:30 a.m. local time at a camp and asked the migrants there to board buses to go to "decontamination" areas. Many of the migrants refused, he said. Earlier, police destroyed another camp -- which housed about 300 people -- with bulldozers, he said. The migrants have been involved in discussions with authorities but don't know where to go, he said. Official: Dismantling under way An official in Calais told CNN that authorities planned to dismantle the migrants' makeshift camps by the end of Thursday. Roughly 550 migrants lived in those camps, said Georges Bos, the associate chief of staff of the Pas-de-Calais prefecture -- the local branch of the French government. "By tonight there will be no possibility left to go to these camps," he said. Bos said authorities had offered to take the migrants by bus to places where they could shower, adding that dismantling the camps was necessary to prevent further spread of scabies. He said that the prefect of the Pas-de-Calais region had told migrants their immigration status would not be checked and that no arrests would be made. It's not the first time French authorities have sought to move on the migrants who congregate in the area around Calais, many hoping to smuggle themselves into Britain inside freight trucks going across the English Channel. A camp in Sangatte was dismantled in 2002 and another known as the Jungle was broken up in 2009. But after each clearance effort, new makeshift camps spring up. 'Deafening silence' Medecins du Monde is one of a number of humanitarian and rights groups that signed an open letter to French Prime Minister Manuel Valls on Tuesday voicing concern over the plight of the migrants. "The situation in Calais is worsening in a deafening silence," it said. "About 700 foreigners, for the most part of Syrian, Afghan and Eritrean origin, fleeing conflicts, violence and persecution, are installed in the town." About 550 of those migrants are living in makeshift camps, the letter said, having claimed asylum in France or waiting to attempt the crossing to Britain. "They live in catastrophic sanitary conditions which have encouraged the development of a scabies epidemic." The groups were "stunned" last week to learn that authorities planned to clear the camps and tackle the scabies outbreak on Wednesday, the letter said -- without coming up with any alternative place of shelter for the large majority of people concerned. "We can anticipate the effects of this expulsion ... inappropriate medical care, people wandering on the streets of Calais, daily police checks, violence, despair and the taking of growing risks to attempt a passage to the United Kingdom, which, since the start of the year, have already caused the deaths of several exiles," it said. The groups urge the French government to come up with a plan to tackle the sanitary situation in the camps while living up to its responsibility to protect the migrants on its soil. The letter was also sent to the French interior minister and the minister for health and social affairs.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/12/opinion/dirty-water-child-killer/index.html	opinion	Dirty water: The child killer we can stop - CNN.com	2014/05/12	Monday May 12 06:49:10 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Barbara Frost has been Chief Executive of WaterAid since September 2005. Prior to joining WaterAid, Frost was Chief Executive of Action on Disability and Development for nine years working with disability organizations in 12 countries throughout Africa and Asia. (CNN) -- Imagine for a moment that we lived in a world where two million children under the age of five were dying every year of diseases that were entirely preventable. Imagine that this world was divided in two, where in one half children were free from this scourge and the other half lived in fear of these diseases which threatened their families every single day. "Mostly it is our children that are affected. I lost two of my children, a boy and a girl and my sister also lost two of her children; two boys. The first one of mine was two years and the recent one who died just two weeks old." These aren't the lines from a dystopian Brothers Grimm story, or a page lifted from the dark ages of our history. These are the words of Yenge Koroma, who lives in Vaama in Sierra Leone. This is our world today. Globally nearly a third of under-five child deaths are attributable to just two diseases, pneumonia and diarrhea. Between them, they account for around two million young lives a year, with nearly 90% of these deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Last year, UNICEF and the World Health Organization launched a Joint Action Plan, which WaterAid strongly supports, to help tackle these two child killers together. These organizations recognized that alongside vaccines and treatments like oral rehydration salts, access to safe drinking water, basic sanitation and good hygiene are vital in helping to prevent these diseases. As Yenge puts it: "The cause of the sicknesses is the water we are drinking. That water is polluted. There is dirt in the water and sometimes fish die in the water mysteriously. Sometimes we launder in that water; we use the water as toilet. All this is really making the water unhygienic but we have no other source. It is the same water we are drinking and that water I believe is really the cause of the sicknesses in this community." Her story is far from unique. Globally 1 in 10 people are without safe drinking water, while over a third of the planet (36%) goes without basic sanitation. In Sub-Saharan Africa the situation is that much more desperate, with 35% going without an improved water source, and a staggering 70% without safe sanitation. This lack of access to such basic and essential services has devastating consequences for people's health. According to the U.N. as many as half the hospital beds in the developing world are being used at any one time by people suffering from waterborne diseases. Economists at the World Health Organization have calculated that a lack of access to these services is costing developing countries $35 billion every year, in healthcare costs alone. When looking at the full range of productivity losses this figure jumps to $260 billion. This devastating loss of life and the economic costs can be tackled if governments, civil society and the private sector work together to address this crisis. Read: From toilet to tap -- drinking recycled waste water Addressing this crisis requires collaboration and innovative partnerships and WaterAid works with organizations like the U.N., the World Health Organization, with governments, businesses, academia and our colleagues and partners around the world to advocate for the step change in approach we need to see to get these services out to the communities that desperately need them. WaterAid works in Sierra Leone and 25 other countries around the world, providing some of the world's poorest people with access to these basic services. Since 1981 WaterAid has reached 19.2 million people with safe water and 15.1 million people with sanitation, and we are proud to be the world's largest international NGO focused entirely on water, sanitation and hygiene. We are approaching a crucial point. Next year, governments from around the world will finalize their negotiations to decide on a new set of Sustainable Development Goals to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030. These goals will help to shape the progress and priorities in the developing world for the next decade and a half. WaterAid believes that these new Sustainable Development Goals should include a dedicated commitment from governments for everyone everywhere to have access to water, sanitation and hygiene. Access to these services is the crucial first step in tackling killer diseases, and in helping lift people out of debilitating poverty. A third of the U.N. member countries have already signaled that this should be a priority, and we agree. Access to sanitation, water and hygiene are fundamental for a decent and productive life. We must not lose this opportunity to act and help end preventable child deaths.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/24/tech/innovation/machine-makes-drinking-water-from-air/index.html	tech	This machine makes drinking water from thin air - CNN.com	2014/04/24	Thursday Apr 24 06:02:15 EDT 2014	Vital Signs is a monthly program bringing viewers health stories from around the world. Tel Aviv, Israel (CNN) -- Water. A vital nutrient, yet one that is inaccessible to many worldwide. The World Health Organization reports that 780 million people don't have access to clean water, and 3.4 million die each year due to water-borne diseases. But an Israeli company thinks it can play a part in alleviating the crisis by producing drinking water from thin air. Water-Gen has developed an Atmospheric Water-Generation Units using its "GENius" heat exchanger to chill air and condense water vapor. "The clean air enters our GENius heat exchanger system where it is dehumidified, the water is removed from the air and collected in a collection tank inside the unit," says co-CEO Arye Kohavi. "From there the water is passed through an extensive water filtration system which cleans it from possible chemical and microbiological contaminations," he explains. "The clean purified water is stored in an internal water tank which is kept continuously preserved to keep it at high quality over time." Energy efficient Capturing atmospheric humidity isn't a ground-breaking invention in itself -- other companies already sell atmospheric water generators for commercial and domestic use -- but Water-Gen says it has made its water generator more energy efficient than others by using the cooled air created by the unit to chill incoming air. "Several companies tried to extract water from the air," says Kohavi. "It looks simple, because air conditioning is extracting water from air. But the issue is to do it very efficiently, to produce as much water as you can per kilowatt of power consumed." He adds: "When you're very, very efficient, it brings us to the point that it is a real solution. Water from air became actually a solution for drinking water." The system produces 250-800 liters (65-210 gallons) of potable water a day depending on temperature and humidity conditions and Kohavi says it uses two cents' worth of electricity to produce a liter of water. Civilian uses Developed primarily for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Water-Gen says it has already sold units to militaries in seven countries, but Kohavi is keen to stress that the general population can also benefit from the technology. He explains: "We believe that the products can be sold to developing countries in different civilian applications. For example in India, [drinking] water for homes is not available and will also be rare in the future. The Atmospheric Water-Generation Unit can be built as a residential unit and serve as a perfect water supply solution for homes in India." Kohavi says Water-Gen's units can produce a liter of water for 1.5 Rupees, as opposed to 15 Rupees for a liter of bottled water. Read: Why Haiti's deadly cholera epidemic could strike again Dirty water Another product Water-Gen has developed is a portable water purification system. It's a battery-operated water filtration unit called Spring. Spring is able to filter 180 liters (48 gallons) of water, and fits into a backpack -- enabling water filtration on the go. "You can go to any lake, any place, any river, anything in the field, usually contaminated with industrial waste, or anything like that and actually filter it into the best drinking water that exists," says Kohavi. Major Alisa Zevin, head of the Facilities and Specialized Equipment Section for the IDF, says the unit is revolutionary for them. "This unit gives logistic independence for the forces and make us ensure that we provide the soldiers high quality water," she says. In 2013, the IDF took Spring to the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan devastated the island country and left 4.2 million people affected by water scarcity. The system filtered what was undrinkable water into potable water, and that is what Water-Gen hopes to accomplish elsewhere where the technology is needed. "It's something as a Westerner you cannot understand because you have a perfect water in the pipe, but people are dying from lack of water," says Kohavi. Although Water-Gen's developments aren't a solution for the water crisis, Kohavi believes that the technology can do for countries that lack clean water, such as Haiti, what it has done for the Philippines. It can be the technology used to not only to filter water, but to save lives. "They could actually bring solution, perfect solution, to the people over there," says Kohavi. "For the kids ... They can use the technology to filter water in the field. People are going days just to carry water. And all our solutions can be an alternative for that."

Watch reports on CNN TV from June 2. (CNN) -- Popular literature would have it that the vampire's preferred habitat is Transylvania (or, if you're under 15, the slightly less glamorous Forks, Washington). But modern day vampire hunters might better focus their attention on a little-known area of northwestern Poland, where earlier this month a suspected vampire grave was exhumed. Slawomir Gorka, who led the dig at a marketplace in the small West Pomeranian town of Kamien Pomorski, told local website kamienskie.info that several unusual aspects of the burial "indicate that it is a vampire burial". Teeth had been removed, a fragment of rock was inserted in the mouth, and a leg had been staked (presumably to prevent the body rising from the grave). And this isn't the first time an interment in Poland has been deemed vampiric. Last July, archaeologists uncovered four decapitated skeletons, their heads placed between their legs, at a construction site in Gliwice, southern Poland. Both the Gliwice and Kamien Pomorski graves are estimated to date back to the 16th century. The burials may sound gruesome, but they are befitting of early medieval Polish folklore's particularly grisly interpretation of the vampire myth. "Specific to Polish vampires is that they are known for eating their own flesh and burial garments when they rise from the dead," says Titus Hjelm, who convenes a course on vampires for the School of Slavonic and Eastern European Studies at University College London. He adds that this may explain the stone placed in the mouth of the skeleton. Fear of vampires was strong among Eastern Europeans in the medieval period. Professor Martyn Rady, a colleague of Hjelm's, posits the folk tales spread from Serbia to surrounding countries following a report sent by Austrian military authorities to their superiors in Vienna. It told of a mercenary soldier who had been turned into a vampire and infected his victims, who when exhumed from their own graves were found to have fresh blood in their cavities. The report was intercepted before reaching the Austrian capital and published in newspapers. The Polish had particular reason to fear vampires rising from their graves, Hjelm explains. "According to some sources, Poles thought that vampires were born, rather than 'made'," he says. "They were normal people who could live normal lives, not aristocrats living in distant castles. The problems only started when these people died. They could come back to live with their families and even impregnate their wives." This may account for the precautions taken during burial. Hjelm adds the notion of vampires being creatures of the night only appeared relatively recently in the 1922 film "Nosferatu". However, some experts warn against presuming all such unconventional burials were because of a fear of vampires. Kamil Kajkowski, an archaeologist with the West-Cassubian Museum in Bytw, northern Poland, admits a number of strange medieval mortuary practices have been discovered during digs in Poland, the most common being those where the body is in the prone position, decapitated, or covered with stones. But the idea is these burials may just as well represent punishment for criminals rather than suspected vampires. That said, Kajkowski concedes the most recent discovery "is certainly unusual". "The pierced thigh-bone and a stone inside the mouth clearly indicate that a range of atypical practices with ritual undertones were performed," he says. "(The stone) might reflect the desire to create some kind of supernatural 'barrier' between the dead and the world of the living." Such peculiar last rites are not confined to medieval Poland. Kajkowski says the last recorded instance of this kind of deviant burial was in 1913. As with the skeletons found in Gliwice last year, the head had been cut off and placed by the legs. "Perhaps such a placement of the head ensured the dead would not be able to 'reach it' and put it back on his neck," he suggests. Vampiric or not, the strange range of historical graves in Poland indicate the country held deep beliefs around the ritualistic burial of certain citizens. Leszek Gardela, from the Institute of Archaeology at the University of Rzeszw, is currently working on a research project into the phenomenon. "Unusual mortuary practices have fascinated Polish scholars since the 1950s (when the first were discovered)," she says. "But so far they remain unknown to a wider international audience. It is high time to change this." 6 destinations with a dark side Send in your best shots from Poland Read more about CNN's sponsorship policy

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/26/world/africa/dakar-biennale-modern-african-art/index.html	world	Dakar Biennale brings modern African art to the world stage - CNN.com	2014/05/26	Monday May 26 07:41:58 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- The march music stops and the camera screens come to life as 70 small black cannons fire a shower of golden confetti high above the crowds. Tumbling through the air, the shiny plume swirls in a fleeting dance, covering the ground in a sprawling blanket of gold stars. It was with this rain of 54,000 star-shaped gold confetti, part of his "Celebration" installation, that Algerian artist Slimane Rais chose to mark the opening of the 11th edition of the Dakar Biennale of Contemporary African Art (Dak'Art) on May 10. RT Merci  Mr le Ministre de la Culture &  nos centaines de visiteurs prsents  l'ouverture de l'expo. internationale!  The month-long event is Africa's major contemporary art stage. Its main exhibition, housed on an industrial wasteland on the southeastern edge of the bustling Senegalese capital, has brought together 61 well-established and emerging artists from all across the continent and the African diaspora. Across three old warehouses, a diverse array of paintings, sculptures, videos, installations and mixed-media work leads audiences into an immersive journey of forms and ideas that seeks to go beyond aesthetics. "We are in an era where art should speak for something," says Ugochukwu-Smooth Nzewi, one of the Biennale's three curators. "There's a crisis in Nigeria for example with Boko Haram -- you expect artists to respond to that because artists act as seers of society," he adds. "[To] engage with the real issues of our time, like inequality or social conditions, without the work losing the sublime quality that makes art art -- it's very important." True, shortcomings such as last-minute schedule changes and repairs, as well as missing work (the area supposed to host the etching prints of Julie Mehretu, the world-renowned Ethiopian artist and one of Dak'Art's biggest names, was left glaringly empty at the time of the opening) took some shine off this year's opening event, but also added a real sense of adventure. Yet, this is still a powerful showcase, with several highlights reaffirming the renewed energy of Africa's contemporary artists and their growing relevance in the global stage. Compelling creations One of them is "The End of Eating Everything," a captivating video installation by Wangechi Mutu. In a small darkened room, the Kenyan artist uses a Medusa-like creature that obsessively devours everything around her to paint a grim picture of today's mass consumerism. Likewise, Cameroonian Justine Gaga deploys giant anthropomorphic gas canisters in "Indignation" to denounce issues like fundamentalism, racism and corruption and to call for resistance. In "Corps en Resonance," Tunisian Naziha Mestaoui invites visitors to interact with three crystal bowls filled with water to produce hypnotizing sounds and eerie light reflections. This is a crowd-pleaser, just like the intriguing work by Kenya-based Sam Hopkins, who playfully mixes real and imaginary NGO logos to question the role and motivations of charity groups. Similarly, Angolan Kiluanji Kia Henda imagines an African NGO that gives grants to Western countries in a series of manipulated images that challenge assumptions over international aid. All the exhibited work has been brought together under the central theme of "Producing the Common," an ambitious attempt to showcase art that engages with the real issues of today. Or, as the biennial's three curators -- Nzewi, Elise Atangana and Abdelkader Damani -- put it, "to connect politics and aesthetics in a vigorous and sustained way." A more tangible link, however, is that all participating artists are exhibiting in Dakar for the first time. "The real value of Dak'Art is that it serves as a platform of visibility for African artists, so it makes no sense if you keep on repeating the same set of people over the different iterations," says Nzewi. "In a way, with this edition we are set to reposition Dak'Art going forward." New faces One of these newcomers is Milumbe Haimbe, a Zambian artist exploring the representation of cultural minorities in popular media. Here, she uses comic book illustrations to challenge the stereotypical portrayal of women in contemporary graphic novels, as well as the absence of female black superheroes in the genre. "My protagonist in this particular comic is female, black, young and gay," says Haimbe, introducing "Ananiya," an undercover agent operating in a not-too-distant future, where the whole world is controlled by a powerful corporation. "The idea is to help different people to relate to different symbolisms," says Haimbe. "A lot of the heroes in popular media, whether they are comics, movies or novels, are heterosexual white males -- nothing wrong with that but I think we need to see another alternative," she adds. "You know, the world is made out of so many people." Like other art festivals, Dak'art gives out awards to participating artists. Haimbe herself was one of the 10 winners, scooping the "Prix de la Fondation Blachere." The grand prize was shared by Algerian artist Driss Ouadahi, for his "Unter Uns" painting, and Nigerian Olu Amoda, for his "Sunflower" sculpture, a compelling creation made of repurposed nails and spoons in Lagos's junkyards. "The sunflower comprises of several small flowers and when they come together they glow under the sun," says Amoda. "So I'm trying to look at the positive signs of the interdependence of Africans ... because the interpretation of Africa is such that it's conflict and famine." Rich history Dak'Art first appeared in the calendars of art aficionados in the early 1990s, initially as an event dedicated to literature and then as a biennial of visual arts that welcomed artists from all over the world. By 1996, however, at a time when few young African artists were able to break into the international market, Dak'Art had already found a new focus as a pan-African contemporary art biennial. The transformation helped it distinguish itself from other large-scale recurring exhibitions but also connected it to a longer history of 20th century black consciousness, where Senegal played a leading role -- it's hard to start talking today about Dak'Art without the name of Leopold Sedar Senghor, Senegal's first president, popping up. A poet, writer and an avid art collector himself, Senghor famously staged the first World Festival of Black Arts in Dakar in 1966, bringing together artists, dancers, writers and musicians from all over Africa, Europe, North and South America and the Caribbean. Today, as more and more African artists are finally making a name outside the continent, Dak'Art has become the main platform for Africa and its diaspora to engage with the international market, attracting the usual crowds of artists, curators, critics and art historians. Similar to previous editions, this year's biennial doesn't start and end with its five main events. Even though the local public here seems to be largely unaware of them, there are some 200 parallel exhibitions running simultaneously across and outside Dakar, giving the opportunity to 500 artists to showcase their work in a wide array of spaces ranging from art galleries and hotel lobbies to bookstores and restaurants. Back in the main exhibition, curator Abdelkader Damani walks past the massive installations dotting the outdoor space, stopping every now and then to hug and talk to artists crossing his path. He says part of Dak'Art's goals this year were to help launch the careers of unknown artists and also help deal with the absence of an active market for contemporary art in the continent. "There's just one problem with the African art in the continent: there are no local markets for this kind of art," he says. "There are not that many institutions who help," he adds. "Artists need to go to Europe or America to find someone who can buy the work and help and do the exhibitions," continues Damani. "I know that what we are doing here is going to open this way to make all the people in Africa understand that." The Dakar Biennale runs until June 8.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/world/europe/wastewater-drug-tests/index.html	world	Tests on sewage water exposes cities on cocaine, cannabis, other drugs - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 07:19:34 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Imagine you could let your city urinate in a cup and submit the sample to a laboratory for drug testing. Would it pass? Researchers in Europe did something similar with 42 major cities, and many of them failed. Lab tests on sewage water to detect chemicals excreted after drug use turned up high levels of cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, meth and other amphetamines. The scientists' results, published this week in the journal Addiction, read like a top 10 list of European party capitals. Some of them should come as no surprise to experienced travelers. Amsterdam in the Netherlands, for example, where smoking cannabis is tolerated -- though not legal -- in its trademark coffee shops, hovered near the top of the list in every category but meth. The port city, also saddled with the reputation of a red-light district hub, took second place in levels of ecstasy excretions found in wastewater, according to the study led by the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology. As for cannabis, a lesser-known town bumped Amsterdam to second place. The top spot for traces of pot in wastewater went to the Serbian city of Novi Sad, population 265,000. Paris came in third. Serious problems The study may seem like a review of dereliction hot spots, but its aim is serious: to help detect dangerous addictions and spikes in the use of certain illicit drugs. Multiple governmental authorities, drug prevention councils, universities and laboratories participated in the research. The scientists are hoping to develop a useful monitoring tool. It's hard to get solid data on drug usage, because it's traditionally gathered via questionnaires, the study said. Respondents can fudge the answers or forget details. Drug users also sometimes don't know what they are really taking or whether other drugs are mixed in. The laboratory analysis of wastewater has the potential to get more accurate results more quickly and detect new drugs spreading into a local market. London cocaine, Prague meth The study reveals apparent preferences for certain drugs in certain regions. Particularly high levels of benzoylecgonine, the main metabolite of cocaine, turned up in the wastewater of Amsterdam, the Belgian city of Antwerp, London and Zurich. Barcelona, Spain, and Basel, Switzerland, were not far behind. London sewage also turned up high levels of ecstasy, but the British capital did not stick out on the list of the other drugs tested for. There were no measurements taken there for cannabis. The Netherlands swept the top three on the list of ecstasy remnants gone down the drain, according to the analysis, but was much further down the list for meth concentration. That drug appears be prevalent in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and parts of Germany. The highest concentration of meth excretions showed up in Prague's wastewater, but in all other categories, the Czech city landed in the mid-teens. The Swiss team turned in results that indicate that ecstasy is a weekend drug in that country. Its excretion levels in wastewater crept along during the week and then rocketed on Fridays, peaked Sundays and nosedived Mondays.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/world/europe/ukraine-crisis/index.html	world	Team of monitors missing in eastern Ukraine - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 09:08:20 EDT 2014	Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- Four members of Europe's Special Monitoring Mission who went missing in the eastern Ukraine city of Donetsk are being held by a pro-Russian group, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Yevhen Perebynis said Wednesday. "The negotiations for their release are in process," Perebynis said during a briefing in Kiev. The team members, who are Swiss, Turkish, Estonian and Danish, were on a routine patrol Monday east of Donetsk when last heard from, according to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. The last time an OSCE team went missing in Donetsk, its members turned up in the hands of militant separatists in the town of Slovyansk. They were freed just over a week later. There were fears Wednesday that another group of 11 monitors had gone missing after being stopped at a roadblock in Marinka, west of Donetsk, but the group reestablished contact with the OSCE after returning to Donetsk, according to an OSCE statement.  Battle for Donetsk airport The deadly battle for control of an airport in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk may have ended, but fears of further violence stalked the streets Wednesday as a military jet flew low overhead. Dozens of pro-Russian separatists were killed after Ukrainian security forces launched an assault on Donetsk International Airport on Monday, following the militants' seizure of a terminal. The bullets stopped flying Tuesday, but the roar of the military jet's engines fed into a narrative being sold by the separatists' spokespeople of a possible bombing campaign against the city. There has been no indication from Ukrainian authorities of any such plan. But amid a climate of fear, distrust and misinformation, and in the aftermath of Monday's assault on the airport -- perhaps the deadliest incident in weeks of unrest -- concern in Donetsk is heightened. There were unconfirmed reports Wednesday of some shots being fired not far from a central administration building occupied by the separatists for some weeks. A representative for the separatists said they were trying to shoot down a drone. The Ukrainian military's move against the militants at Donetsk airport has been interpreted by some as an indication that newly elected President Petro Poroshenko will take a tougher stance. The presence of military aircraft may be intended as a reminder of the security forces' capacity to act. The separatists' attempt to take the airport came within hours of Poroshenko claiming victory in Sunday's vote. Donetsk has been at the heart of the separatists' bid to declare independence for the wider Donetsk region from the rest of Ukraine, which was mirrored in the neighboring Luhansk region. 'Our guys' Signs of the fierce fighting around the airport were visible in Donetsk on Tuesday. Blood and human remains could be seen near two blown-out trucks that had carried separatists. A pile of bodies lay in a city morgue, including the remains of a woman whose head had been apparently taken off by a round. One resident, who didn't want to show his face on camera, told a CNN team on the ground that many people in the region would be fighting -- and he didn't know who could stop the conflict, except perhaps Russia. Asked whether he thought the eastern region could ever be part of a united Ukraine again, he replied, "I think Ukraine will be destroyed." Other onlookers said the dead were "nashi," Russian for "our guys," in an indication of the public support the separatists command in their battle against the federal authorities. Eastern Ukraine was the support base for ousted pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych, and many Russian speakers there feel closer to Moscow than to Kiev. The Donetsk mayor's office said that 40 people had died in the airport fighting, including two civilians, but did not specify how many of the dead were separatists. The separatists said that 35 of their own had been killed and about 60 more injured. The separatist movement in Donetsk believed it was offered a three-hour truce Tuesday afternoon to leave the city of Donetsk, according to a spokeswoman for the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic who asked not to be identified to avoid possible arrest. The Donetsk People's Republic learned of this truce online, the spokeswoman told CNN, adding that Ukrainian armed forces were threatening to bomb separatist strongholds in the city if they failed to leave. The Ukrainian government denied offering rebels any such truce. The government's anti-terror operation told CNN there is a longstanding offer of amnesty to separatists who turn themselves in and give up their weapons, unless they are guilty of murder. NATO: Signs of Russian troops packing up Kiev and the West have accused Russia of backing and supplying the separatists, a claim Moscow denies. They have also voiced concern over a buildup of what NATO estimated was 40,000 Russian troops near Russia's border with Ukraine. In a sign that Russia may have heeded calls for it to withdraw those forces, NATO said Wednesday that there was "ongoing evidence of equipment and supplies being packed or prepared for movement" in the area. "A small number of units have now withdrawn from the border. The activity we are observing continues to suggest a slow withdrawal of forces," a NATO military officer said. However, he said, many of the Russian troops remain in the border area and are capable of operations at short notice. "Thousands of troops have withdrawn, but tens of thousands remain," he said. The Kremlin announced about 10 days ago that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered tens of thousands of Russian troops to return to their bases but said the pullback could take some time. NATO is monitoring the situation and would welcome a complete, verifiable Russian withdrawal, the NATO military officer said. But, he added, "Any withdrawal does not erase or reverse what has happened in recent months. Russia has violated the trust of the international community by illegally invading Ukraine. The security dynamic in Europe has been fundamentally changed." Ukraine is not part of NATO, but other former Soviet states such as Poland do belong to the alliance. Russia is opposed to any move by Ukraine to forge closer ties with NATO.

Monday night's attacks in the town of Buni Yadi killed 18 soldiers and 15 police, the sources said. "There were attacks by Boko Haram insurgents in Buni Yadi, but details are still sketchy," Yobe state police commissioner Sanusi Rufa'i said. The attacks come more than a month after the group abducted an estimated 276 girls from a boarding school in Chibok, also in northeastern Nigeria. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 girls still are missing. Boko Haram translates as "Western education is a sin" in the Hausa language. The militant group says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/world/asia/vietnam-china-paracels-fishing-boat-collision/index.html	world	Vietnamese fishing boat sinks after collision with Chinese vessel - CNN.com	2014/05/27	Tuesday May 27 03:57:56 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- A Vietnamese fishing boat has sunk after colliding with a Chinese vessel near an island chain in the South China Sea at the center of a territorial dispute between the two Communist neighbors. According to China's state-run Xinhua news agency, the Vietnamese vessel had been "harassing" a Chinese fishing boat at 5 p.m. local time on Monday in waters near the Paracel Islands, a largely uninhabited archipelago also known by the Chinese as the Xisha Islands. However, Luu Tien Thang, a senior officer aboard a Vietnamese coast guard boat patrolling waters nearby, told CNN Tuesday the Vietnamese vessel reported that it had actually been rammed by the Chinese ship during a distress call. While the Chinese vessel was purportedly a fishing boat, Luu said there were "usually Chinese military boats in the area with the fishing fleet." Other Vietnamese fishing boats and coast guard ships picked up the 10 crew members aboard the Vietnamese vessel, Luu added. Chinese ships reach Vietnam to extract thousands of citizens 'Forcefully intruded' Relations between China and Vietnam have soured in recent weeks after a state-owned Chinese oil company began drilling for oil some 17 nautical miles off the Paracels. Vietnamese officials say Chinese military and civilian ships have been harassing their vessels around the islands -- which are controlled by Beijing but claimed by Hanoi -- even accusing the Chinese of repeatedly ramming into them and shooting water cannon. READ: How an oil rig sparked anti-China riots in Vietnam China maintains that its current drilling activities are legitimate and blames the Vietnamese for provoking the conflict. At a daily press briefing in Beijing Tuesday, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Qin Gang said the Vietnamese vessel had "forcefully intruded" into the area where its drilling rig was operating, then ran into the left side of a Chinese fishing boat before capsizing. "I want to stress that the direct cause for this incident is that the Vietnamese side ... insisted on disturbing the normal operation by the Chinese side and took dangerous action on the sea," said Qin. "We once again urge the Vietnamese side to stop immediately all kinds of disruptive and damaging activities." He said there is "no dispute concerning the sovereignty of the Xisha islands," and that they are Chinese territory. "We hope the Vietnamese side will stop its disruptive actions and bear in mind the overall interests of the stability of the region. Only by doing so can the Vietnamese side uphold the overall interests of bilateral relationship," Qin added. The spat recently spilled into violent anti-Chinese protests across Vietnam two weeks ago, prompting Beijing to evacuate thousands of its nationals. Recent video aired by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV showed some limping or being carried down the stairs of a medical flight arriving in the city of Chengdu, many with limbs bandaged. Two Chinese nationals were killed in earlier clashes, authorities said. Vietnam characterized the protests as "spontaneous acts" by individuals who were exploiting the situation to "cause social disorder." READ: What's behind China's territorial spats?

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/25/world/europe/belgium-jewish-museum-shooting/index.html	world	Video shows Jewish Museum killer - CNN.com	2014/05/25	Sunday May 25 06:58:25 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Images from the Jewish Museum of Belgium show the gunman behind Saturday's deadly attack approaching the building, opening fire, and walking away. He used an AK-47 assault rifle to carry out the shooting, which killed at least three people, police said Sunday. Photographs and video released by Belgian police show the man wearing a cap and blue shirt, carrying two bags over his shoulder. The images do not show his face clearly. The shooter left on foot after the attack and headed toward a different part of downtown Brussels before he disappeared, according to police. Authorities are hunting the suspect, believed to have acted alone, deputy public prosecutor Ine Van Wymersch said. Investigators hope the public will help to identify the suspect. Two of those killed in Saturday's attack are Israeli and the third is French, Van Wymersch said. The Israelis were a couple in their 50s from Tel Aviv, Israel's Foreign Ministry said. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the French victim was a woman and offered his condolences Sunday to the families of all those killed, his ministry said. A fourth person, a Belgian national who works at the museum, remains in critical condition, Van Wymersch said Monday. That contradicted museum spokeswoman Chouna Lomponda, who said Sunday that the fourth person had died. Terrorism has not been ruled out, Van Wymersch said Monday. No arrests have been made, she said. A person who was detained Saturday soon after the shooting is considered a witness and not a suspect, Van Wymersch added. That witness was not seen in surveillance video recorded during the attack, she said. The circumstances of the shooting have raised suspicions that it may have been an anti-Semitic attack, but no motive has been determined. Van Wymersch said it was too early to determine whether the attack was an act of terrorism or motivated by anti-Semitism. Could the killer attack again? A senior Belgian law enforcement official told CNN that Belgian police do not yet have any leads on the killer. It's been challenging to identify the killer because he was wearing a baseball cap. The official told CNN that authorities have no information yet on the specific motivation or ideological background of the killer. They do not know whether they are dealing with Islamist terrorism, some sort of neo-Nazi type of attack or another category altogether. But there is concern that the killer could strike again, the official said, and that authorities could be dealing with a "Mohammed Merah" type of killer. Merah, a French-Algerian Islamist radical who received terror training with al Qaeda-linked militants in Pakistan, shot and killed three French paratroopers in two attacks in March 2012 before killing three schoolchildren and their teacher at a Jewish school in Toulouse, France, during a 10-day shooting rampage which he filmed with a camera attached to his torso. But the official stressed that no evidence has emerged in Saturday's attack pointing to any link to Islamist terrorism. The official told CNN that authorities cannot say with certainty whether the Brussels gunman was carrying a video camera to film the attacks. Some investigators who viewed the surveillance footage believed this was the case and some did not. The quality of the surveillance footage was not good enough to make a conclusive determination. The official said the killer shot the Israeli couple first in the museum entryway with one of his weapons. The couple had been consulting the wall display. He then pulled out a Kalashnikov assault rifle and shot the others inside the museum. Surveillance cameras picked up the killer walking on two or three streets before he disappeared. The official said the killer appeared to be skilled in using weapons and likely planned the attack meticulously. The official stressed Belgian authorities are investigating all possible angles, including Islamist terrorism, neo-Nazi attack, and other categories. With regard to the threat from Islamist terrorism, he noted there has been longstanding concern over the 100 or so Belgian Islamist extremists who received training in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region over the years, and high current concern over several hundred who have more recently traveled to fight in Syria. The concern is they might be able to use skills acquired there to launch attacks back home. Heightened security Belgium's Interior Ministry raised its terror alert level in the wake of the attack. Belgian Interior Minister Joelle Milquet told a news conference Saturday that the security threat level was at its highest at locations frequented by the Jewish community across the country. This measure is precautionary, she added. She met with the police, Belgian Jewish community leaders and the president of the European Jewish Congress, Moshe Kantor, on Sunday to discuss the security arrangements, an Interior Ministry statement said. The Jewish community is determined to continue its activities in schools, synagogues and cultural centers, but under heightened security with a permanent police presence, the statement said. Kantor is also to hold urgent talks with Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo, his group said in a statement. Kantor described the attack as "horrific but not surprising" and urged action by European governments to tackle extremism and hate speech. "Attacks on Jewish targets in Europe do not exist in a vacuum, but are part and parcel of an overall climate of hate and incitement against Jewish communities," he said, according to the statement. "Anti-Semitism begins in the public domain, it gains international legitimacy and becomes normative even in our national parliaments but it always ends in killing Jews." Pope Francis, who was in Israel on Sunday, told reporters that he had a "heavy heart" after the "atrocious" attack. "While reiterating my condemnation for this criminal act of anti-Semitic hatred, I entrust the victims of this crime to the God of mercy and invoke upon the wounded his gift of healing," the pope said in Tel Aviv before departing for Jerusalem. Jewish men targeted in France In neighboring France, two Jewish men were assaulted late Saturday as they were leaving a synagogue in Creteil, outside Paris, the French Interior Ministry said Sunday. Two men were involved in the aggression against the two Jewish men, who are bruised, Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet said in an interview with CNN affiliate BFMTV. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve instructed police and other authorities to strengthen security at Jewish sites while looking for the perpetrators of Saturday's incident, which he strongly condemned, according to the ministry. In the wake of the attack in Brussels, Cazeneuve reaffirmed his determination to fight those who commit murderous acts and spread racism as well as well as anti-Semitism, the ministry said. Anti-Semitism worldwide A global survey released in May by the Anti-Defamation League reported on the levels of anti-Semitism found in 102 nations. Belgium received a 27% index score in the survey. The index score represents the percentage of adults in a country who answered "probably true" to a majority of the anti-Semitic stereotypes tested. Belgium has an adult population of about 8.7 million. The ADL said one-fourth of adults worldwide are "deeply infected with anti-Semitic attitudes," according to a CNN.com report on the survey. France had the second highest index score in Europe, with 37%, although that was well below Greece, with 67%. Germany had a score of 27%, Spain 29%, Sweden 4% and the United Kingdom 8%. The United States was given an index score of 9%. More on rampage killings

A U.S. Navy helicopter spotted the capsized the 39-foot Cheeki Rafiki sailboat within a Coast Guard search area east of Cape Cod, officials said. A Navy boat crew and surface swimmer assessed the damaged boat, but the swimmer found no signs of the crew after knocking on the hull and reaching below the waterline, the Coast Guard said. Search crews looked Friday for a bright-colored life raft and the missing sailors, who the Royal Yachting Association identified as skipper Andrew Bridge, 21; Steve Warren, 52; Paul Goslin, 56; and James Male, 23. As expected, the Coast Guard suspended the search at 10 p.m. ET Friday -- which was midnight in the search zone -- after scouring another 21,000 square miles. No sailors had been found as of then. In a statement Friday night, the Coast Guard hinted that the prospects anyone would be found alive are slim. "Based on the extreme sea conditions at the time of distress, but assuming best-case emergency equipment, the estimated survival time past the time of distress was approximately 20 hours," the Coast Guard said. "Searches were suspended nearly 200 hours after the time of distress." The four British sailors have been missing in the Atlantic Ocean for more than a week. The 39-foot (12 meters) Cheeki Rafiki was sailing from the Caribbean to the United Kingdom on May 15 when it began taking on water, according to Doug Innes, the yacht's managing agent. Innes said contact was lost with the boat -- which he describes as "a performance racer/cruiser" that is "equipped for trans-Atlantic sailing and racing" -- early the next morning. He added that he believed the crew abandoned to the life raft. But the U.S. Coast Guard appeared to dispel that notion, saying Friday night that "the boat's life raft was secured in its storage space ... indicating the crew had not been able to use it for emergency purposes."

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/23/world/europe/uk-richard-iii-reburial/index.html	world	Court rules Leicester will be final burial place of King Richard III - CNN.com	2014/05/23	Friday May 23 05:46:43 EDT 2014	London (CNN) -- It's been a long journey for Richard III, the 15th century king whose skeleton was found under a parking lot in the English city of Leicester. But on Friday, his final destination became clear. The medieval monarch will be reburied in Leicester Cathedral, just a stone's throw away from where his remains were uncovered. The discovery of his remains, complete with curved spine and staved-in skull, in the summer of 2012 sparked global headlines and a new battle -- over which city would host his remains in perpetuity. Archaeologists had been searching the site for Leicester's long-lost Greyfriars Friaryhad and always planned for any bodies they uncovered to be reburied at the city's cathedral. That was challenged in the courts by a group calling itself the Plantagenet Alliance, which argued it was the medieval king's wish to be buried in the historic northern city of York -- the city they claim was closest to his heart. But judges at the Royal Courts of Justice ruled Friday that his funeral should be held in Leicester as originally planned. Their ruling notes that since Richard's exhumation, "passions have been roused and much ink has been spilt" as rival camps fought to stake their claim. Now, they say, "We agree that it is time for Richard III to be given a dignified reburial, and finally laid to rest." The University of Leicester, which was behind the excavation project, celebrated the outcome on Twitter. "Richard III will be reinterred in Leicester. Great news for the University, our city and everybody involved in the discovery," it said. 'Horrific death' In bringing its case, the Alliance objected to the lack of consultation over where the newly-rediscovered monarch's bones should be laid to rest, saying more thought should have been given to the question. On its website, the Alliance -- made up of people who claim to be distantly related to Richard III, and headed by Stephen Nicolay, his 16th great nephew -- set out its argument to have him reburied in York. "We believe that the proposed location of Leicester is wholly inappropriate for the burial of King Richard III, who had no connections with the town beyond his horrific death, bodily despoliation and appalling burial in a foreshortened grave," it said. "As people who have died in a foreign place are 'brought home,' so too King Richard should be brought to a place with which he had every possible connection and affection." Richard III lost his life in the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 -- the last king of England to die on the battlefield and the last monarch from the House of York. Until his remains were found, the monarch was best known to modern Britons as the hunchbacked Shakespearean villain accused of murdering his nephews, the "Princes in the Tower," to usurp the throne. That notorious history may make the battle over his reburial site appear all the more unlikely. But both sides insisted they have a strong claim to his remains. Now Leicester could see a significant commercial benefit, if tourists flock to see his final resting place. The city already has plans for a new tomb in the cathedral, where a memorial stone has long paid tribute to the last Plantagenet king, and for a visitor center on the site of the Greyfriars car park, telling the story of Richard's life, his death, and his rediscovery. In a statement, Leicester City Mayor Peter Soulsby said: "I am delighted that Leicester Cathedral can now proceed with its plans to give King Richard lll a dignified reburial here in the city. "With the support of the city council and the University of Leicester, the cathedral is now planning for the king's reinterment to take place in the spring of next year."

The bus was picking up children from an event at a church in Fundacion, Colombia, when the blaze began, Col. Adan Leon told CNN affiliate Caracol TV. "Everyone started to scream and run," a child who was on the bus told Caracol, describing how he escaped through a window. Victims of the deadly fire included 31 children and one adult, Harry Aaron, a civil defense official in Magdalena department, told CNN. Authorities are investigating what caused the fire, Leon told Caracol. One witness told Caracol that the driver went to get a drink and left children to put gasoline into the vehicle's tank. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos expressed condolences on Twitter Sunday and traveled to the northern Colombian municipality to be with victims. "The country is in mourning," he said. 48 die in bus crash No evidence of fire before FedEx truck crashes into bus  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/25/world/pope-mideast-trip/index.html	world	Pope Francis invites Israeli, Palestinian heads to Vatican peace talks - CNN.com	2014/05/25	Sunday May 25 02:51:34 EDT 2014	Bethlehem, West Bank (CNN) -- Pope Francis extended an invitation Sunday to the leaders of Israel and the Palestinian Authority to travel to the Vatican for a "peace initiative," after earlier calling for a two-state solution to the intractable conflict. The pontiff's remarks came at the end of an outdoor Mass in Bethlehem's Manger Square on the second day of his three-day trip to the Middle East. "In this, the birthplace of the Prince of Peace, I wish to invite you, President Mahmoud Abbas, together with Israeli President Shimon Peres, to join me in heartfelt prayer to God for the gift of peace," Francis said. "I offer my home in the Vatican as a place for this encounter of prayer." He added, "Building peace is difficult, but living without peace is a constant torment. The men and women of these lands, and of the entire world, all of them, ask us to bring before God their fervent hopes for peace." The Palestinian side has accepted the invitation and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas will go to the Vatican, a Palestinian Legislative Council member, Hanan Ashrawi, told CNN. The Israeli President's office said that he welcomed the invitation. "President Peres has always supported, and will continue to support, any attempts to progress the cause of peace," his office said. Pope Francis then traveled on to Tel Aviv, where in remarks on the airport tarmac to Peres and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he again issued an invitation to pray for peace at the Vatican. He also reiterated the Vatican's support for Israel's right to exist in peace and security. The next stop on his historic trip was Jerusalem. Two states Earlier, speaking alongside Abbas in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, Francis called for the recognition of a Palestinian state -- but he made the same demand on behalf of the state of Israel. He urged "the acknowledgment by all of the right of two states to exist and to live in peace and security within internationally recognized borders." The Pope called on all sides to pursue a path to peace together and not take unilateral actions to disrupt it. "I can only express my profound hope that all will refrain from initiatives and actions which contradict the stated desire to reach a true agreement, and that peace will be pursued with tireless determination and tenacity," he said. Middle East peace talks recently stalled despite high-profile efforts by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to push them forward. The government of Israel has objected to unilateral initiatives by Palestinians to seek international recognition as a state, and Palestinians have objected to Israeli initiatives to expand settlements on the West Bank. Protecting Christians In his remarks in Bethlehem, Francis called on Abbas to protect the religious rights of Palestinian Catholics. The Vatican has expressed concern over the emigration of Palestinian Christians. The pontiff also took a stand for the poor, suffering under tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. "Even in the absence of violence, the climate of instability and a lack of mutual understanding have produced insecurity, the violation of rights, isolation and the flight of entire communities, conflicts, shortages and sufferings of every sort," he said. After meeting with Abbas, Francis cruised in the Popemobile through a crowd of hundreds of Catholic faithful and onlookers gathered in Manger Square as they awaited the papal Mass. Priests and the faithful swayed to religious music, while many waved red, green, black and white Palestinian flags and others yellow and white Vatican flags. The Pope hopped off the Popemobile to shake hands with people in the crowd. In a symbolically charged moment, he also stopped the vehicle to cross over to the separation barrier erected by Israel, its surface daubed with graffiti including the words "Free Palestine!" There, arm outstretched, he touched the concrete wall, his head apparently bowed in prayer. Mustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestine National Initiative, told CNN, "The Pope did not only put his hand on a concrete wall. He put his hand on occupation. He put his hand on (an) apartheid system, on a system of separation, and discrimination, and oppression." Refugee children make appeal Francis also met with a group of Palestinian refugee children while in the West Bank. As they entered, the children held up signs about the occupation of Palestinian territories, typed in Arabic, Italian and English. "Muslims and Christians live under the occupation," read one. Another said, "I have never been to the sea!" in an apparent reference to the restrictions on movement under which Palestinians live. After the children sang and presented him with gifts, the Pope responded in his native tongue, Spanish, to say he had heard their message. "Never let the past determine your lives," he said. "Violence is not overcome by violence. Violence is overcome by peace." While in Jerusalem, Francis will meet with Bartholomew, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. His visit to the region commemorates the 50th anniversary of the landmark meeting between Pope Paul VI and the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians at the time, Patriarch Athenagoras, in Jerusalem. The pope will also meet the city's grand mufti and chief rabbis, visit the Western Wall and Yad Vashem, a memorial to the Holocaust, and lay a wreath on the grave of the founder of modern Zionism, Theodor Herzl. The Holy Land visit is the first for Francis as leader of the Roman Catholic Church, and just the fourth for any pontiff in the modern era. 'Urgent' solution needed to Syrian crisis On the first day of his trip, Francis also gave a message of unity as he celebrated Mass at a stadium in Amman, Jordan -- a majority Muslim nation with a significant Christian community. In his homily, Francis spoke of the need for tolerance and diversity and urged everyone to put aside grievances and divisions. "The mission of the Holy Spirit is to beget harmony ... and to create peace in different situations and between different people," he said. "Let us ask the Spirit to prepare our hearts to encounter our brothers and sisters so that we may overcome our differences rooted in political thinking, language, culture and religion." Christian refugees from Syria, Iraq and the Palestinian territories were among those present, and 1,400 children received their First Communion at the Mass. The Pope's trip to the Holy Land has been billed as a "pilgrimage for prayer," with its roots in faith, not politics. But in a region where religion and politics are so closely intertwined, his every remark takes on an added significance. The pontiff is traveling with two friends -- a rabbi, Abraham Skorka, and a Muslim, Sheikh Omar Abboud, who leads Argentina's Muslim community. The Vatican has said their presence is symbolic of his call for unity. The Pope's first stop was at al-Husseini Royal Palace in Amman, where he met with Jordan's King Abdullah II. In televised remarks after that meeting, Francis paid tribute to Jordan's efforts to promote interfaith tolerance and to the welcome that the small nation has given to Palestinian refugees and, more recently, those fleeing war-torn Syria. Francis said it was "necessary and urgent" that a peaceful solution is found to the crisis in Syria. While in Jordan, Francis met some of the 600,000 Syrians who have fled since the start of the civil war in 2011, as well as refugees from Iraq. He also visited the River Jordan, where many Christians believe Jesus was baptized.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/22/world/meast/egypt-presidential-candidates-economy/index.html	world	Can Egypt's presidential candidates transform economic fortunes? - CNN.com	2014/05/22	Thursday May 22 11:59:52 EDT 2014	Watch Marketplace Middle East every week on CNN International. Click here for the show times. For full coverage of the Egyptian election in Arabic, visit CNN Arabic. Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Since the 2011 revolution, Egyptians have seen near non-stop protests, the toppling of two presidents, six elections, and a seemingly endless political crisis. But what they haven't witnessed yet is what has been demanded all along -- a better economy. As the country goes to the polls next week to elect a new president, both candidates insist this is something they can be trusted to deliver. Former army chief Abdel Fattah el Sisi pledges new roads, housing, airports, jobs and an end to the energy crisis. Sisi's lone opponent, left leaning politician Hamdeen Sabahi, has vowed to dish out millions of dollars in investments to help reopen government factories, create new jobs, build new housing and improve health care. These are lofty promises. But has either candidate offered specifics on how they will get things done? "Not yet," said Cairo based economist, Angus Blair. "We've still got a few weeks before elections but the pressure is growing on both of them to come up with plans and that includes Sisi." Blair believes that in order to deliver on campaign promises, Egypt's next president must attract investors from both inside and outside Egypt through large scale economic reform. "It's not going to be easy," he added. "The problems are surmountable but I have to say the structural problems of Egypt's economy are enormous." These problems include rising food prices, unemployment at roughly 14% and a crippling budget deficit of around 12% of GDP. On top of all that, passions are still running high over the ousting and trial of former president Mohamed Morsy who was removed from his post by the army in 2013. A critical step to recovery, many business-minded economists say, is cutting costly food and fuel subsidies that eat up roughly one third of Egypt's budget. But for the country's poor, cutting subsidies will be an extremely tough pill to swallow. To ease the impact, Blair says Egypt's next leader must launch projects to help the masses -- like improving transport and affordable housing -- that can be kick-started by billions of aid received from Gulf Arab states. "If the right policies are in place, Egypt will respond quickly," Blair said. "But changing sentiment is the key by putting right policies and right people in place to show something is changing." Only then, he concludes, can Egypt's next president truly improve the economy and meet the demands of millions of Egyptians still waiting for a better life three years after revolution came to the country.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/26/world/africa/nigeria-kidnapped-girls/index.html	world	Nigerian military official says he knows where kidnapped girls are - CNN.com	2014/05/26	Monday May 26 04:22:19 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- A top Nigerian military official believes he knows the whereabouts of girls kidnapped last month, but he says the nation's military will not use force to try to rescue them, a state news report said Monday. "We want our girls back. I can tell you that our military can and will do it, but where they are held, can we go there with force?" asked Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh. "Nobody should say Nigerian military does not know what it is doing; we can't kill our girls in the name of trying to get them back." His comments were reported by the News Agency of Nigeria, a state-run news service. Badeh continued: "The good news for the parents of the girls is that we know where they are, but we cannot tell you. "We cannot come and tell you the military secret, just leave us alone, we are working to get the girls back," he reportedly said. In response to the news, Pentagon spokesman Adm. John Kirby told CNN U.S. officials were not able to confirm the report. More than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped in northern Nigeria last month by Boko Haram, an act that drew international condemnation. The terror group abducted an estimated 276 girls on April 14 from a boarding school in Chibok. The Nigerian military suffered an embarrassing setback when it retracted a report that nearly all the kidnapped girls were released. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 girls are still missing. Nigerians and others have accused their government of not acting swiftly or efficiently enough to protect the girls seized in the dead of night. Boko Haram translates as "Western education is a sin" in the Hausa language. The militant group says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Boko Haram's attacks have intensified in recent years.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/world/africa/egypt-presidential-election/index.html	world	Egypt presidential vote extended to third day - CNN.com	2014/05/27	Tuesday May 27 12:53:38 EDT 2014	Egyptians, do you plan to vote in the presidential election? Tell us why or why not. (CNN) -- Voting in Egypt's presidential election will be extended into a third day Wednesday to allow citizens a greater chance to vote, election officials announced Tuesday in a move criticized by both candidates' campaigns. It wasn't immediately clear whether the candidates' complaints would have any effect on the decision by the country's election commission. The election, initially scheduled only for Monday and Tuesday, pits former army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi against Hamdeen Sabahy. "We strongly denounce the (election commission's) decision to extend voting another day. Extending the voting period for no real plausible reason will open the door to possible vote violations and rigging," said Hussein AbdelGhany, a top adviser to Sabahy. The election commission extended the voting in part so that people living in areas away from where they are registered can return to vote, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported. No numbers have been released, but the move comes amid concerns expressed in Egyptian media that the turnout has been low. TV hosts this week openly criticized voters for not participating. At the few dozen polling places that CNN visited or drove by in the Cairo area this week, there were no significant lines of people waiting to vote. The move also comes after Egyptian Prime Minister Ibrahim Mehleb, late Monday night, declared Tuesday a public holiday "in compliance to citizens' wishes," state TV reported. The decision was thought to be a move to increase turnout. Both campaigns said they filed complaints against the commission's extension. AbdelGhany said Sabahy would consider withdrawing from the race if his complaint was ignored. The election was called because then-President Mohamed Morsy was removed from power in July in a popular military coup. El-Sisi, who was army chief at the time, stepped down from his military post this year to run for president.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/26/health/weight-loss-edgar-hernandez-irpt/index.html	health	Teen drops nearly 200 pounds - CNN.com	2014/05/26	Monday May 26 07:42:48 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Do you have a weight-loss success story to share? Tell us how you did it and you could be featured in our weekly weight-loss story on CNN.com. (CNN) -- Edgar Hernandez didn't expect to learn that he was pre-diabetic at age 16. When his mother burst into tears at the doctor's office, it hit him hard. He was 370 pounds and couldn't stand to look at himself. It was tough being a fat kid, but things became unbearable in high school. Edgar was seeing a therapist for depression symptoms. He was frequently bullied in gym class. Kids would point at his "fat wobbling everywhere," especially as he struggled to keep up. "I tried my best to ignore it. But there were times when I just gave in and started crying," said Edgar, who lives in a suburb of St. Louis and is now 18. Everyone in his family had a weight problem; his parents developed type 2 diabetes in their forties. But Edgar was the biggest. "He would eat two really big burritos or sandwiches a day, packed with cheese, sour cream, a lot of bread, butter," his older brother Mario said. "He would be watching TV, playing video games." After receiving the sobering blood test result at the doctor's office, Edgar went home and cried. And then something new happened: He owned up to his weight problem. "It was time to stop blaming others for my choices and make a choice to take responsibility," he said. He dried his tears, threw on his jacket and began jogging. He only got about half a mile before he stopped and threw up. That was a year and a half ago. Edgar, who is 5-foot-9, went on to drop nearly 200 pounds. He now weighs 185 pounds. He has traded his double-XL shirts and size 48 pants for medium T-shirts and 33-inch pants. It happened slowly at first. After that gut-impulse jog in November 2012, Edgar started walking before or after school. As he could, he added distance until he was walking about two miles a day. He started to incorporate running intervals until, months later, he could run a full mile. The weight began to come off, but the teen wasn't seeing as much progress as he had hoped. It was his older brother, Mario, who helped him kick the weight loss into high gear. Mario, who carried 235 pounds on his 5-foot-7 frame, was inspired by Edgar's will to change. He took Edgar to the grocery store and together they overhauled the family's pantry. Chicken breasts and fresh produce replaced the processed foods and sodas that were once the staple at home, Mario said. Edgar's typical breakfast became a peanut butter sandwich with honey and banana slices. Dinners usually featured a chicken breast with two cups of broccoli. He didn't have a specific diet or calorie count; it was all about portion sizes, the teen said. The brothers became each other's support. They started running together in January 2013, buying sweatpants and thermal gear to keep them warm in the Illinois weather. Mario has lost 70 pounds and continues to run alongside his brother, Edgar said. The brothers, who live at home with their parents, have seen their weight loss inspire some changes for the whole family, Mario said. The family has cut down on eating out -- once every couple of weeks, as opposed to four to five times a week. "As a family, we go outside more, walk a little more. It shows because we have a lot more energy," Mario said. "Even though other members haven't lost as much weight, maybe five pounds, you can see it in their faces." These days, Edgar can't get enough of running. His favorite activities are heavy cardio and weightlifting. The teen even ran his first half-marathon in April, and he's planning another one soon. "Running is what made me feel happy; I had gotten what they call 'runner's high' and now running has become a lifestyle," he said. Edgar has also found his calling in his new healthy lifestyle. He will start college at Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville in the fall and plans to study exercise science. For Mario, watching his little brother shed the pounds at such a young age has been a source of pride. "If you would have told me three years ago that he'd be running a half-marathon, I wouldn't believe you," Mario said. "You see a completely different person that's a lot happier, has more energy and is more active." Edgar couldn't agree more. "I wouldn't even step out my door to get the mail before," he said. "People don't see the dark, sad side of me anymore. They see a bright, happy kid." For the people out there looking to lose weight, the teenager has the following advice: Don't put it off. If you say you're going to run, do it today, not tomorrow. "Don't wait, because it will get worse," he said. "You'll start putting it off until something serious happens and when something serious happens, it will change your life."

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/16/world/americas/skeleton-mexico-americans/index.html	world	13,000-year-old teenager was early American - CNN.com	2014/05/16	Friday May 16 04:26:52 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- A teenage girl may have gotten lost in a cave looking for water, nearly 13,000 years ago. Naia, as she's known today, likely fell to her death in a deep, dark pit. Now, her remains are shining a light on the genetic heritage of what we believe are the first people in the Americas. Researchers have discovered Naia's bones in a pit in an underwater cave system in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Her skeleton, described in the journal Science this week, is one of the oldest of any humans found in the Americas. She comes from a group of ancient people anthropologists call Paleoamericans. Genetic analysis of her remains suggests that Naia is related to modern Native Americans. It's a clue to resolving the issue of whether the group we call Native Americans are indeed related to the first settlers of this land mass. This study promotes the view that "Native Americans and Paleoamericans share a homeland," said James Chatters of Applied Paleoscience, who was the lead author of the study. That homeland is called Beringia, also called the Bering Land Bridge, that connected what is now Siberia and Alaska. The new research goes against the idea that the first Americans may have come over in separate migrations from Europe and Asia. Other genetic evidence from both modern Native Americans and ancient skeletons indicates that people of Siberia landed in eastern Beringia between 26,000 and 18,000 years ago, the study said. They seem to have moved south after 17,000 years ago. So how do we know who this girl was? Naia's genetic lineage was analyzed through mitochondrial DNA. This is genetic material that is passed from mothers to children, and is stored in the mitochondria, a part of a cell that is essential for energy production and is sometimes thought of as a "power plant." Scientists are able to characterize genetic lineages by looking at mitochondrial DNA. It's important to note, however, that this does not reveal as much information about a person's heritage as nuclear DNA, which is stored in the cell's nucleus and contains material from both parents. Researchers are planning to look at Naia's nuclear DNA also, Chatters said. Researchers found that the 12,000- to 13,000-year-old teenager's mitochondrial DNA belongs to Haplogroup D1, a category only found in the Americas these days but which originally came from an Asian lineage. Some South American populations today have this genetic signature: 29% of indigenous people of Chile and Argentina have it; so do 11% of Native Americans, said Deborah Bolnick, assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Texas at Austin. Through her maternal line, the girl in the cave seems to have been related to modern Native Americans as well as their ancestors, Bolnick said. Why doesn't she look like Native Americans? But wait -- Naia's physical features are very different from that of modern day Native Americans. Flat, broad faces with flaring cheekbones, and short, round heads are typical of Native Americans, Chatters said. By contrast, Naia had an angular head, and a small, relatively narrow face. Naia's features are more similar to other ancient populations and isolated hunter-gatherer populations in such places as the Philippines, Chatters said. "Paleoamericans -- those earliest people with the distinctive skull and facial features -- could have come from Siberia too," Bolnick said. "It therefore seems more likely that differences between Paleoamericans and Native Americans today are due to evolutionary changes that occurred in Beringia and the Americas over the last 9,000 years." Some scientists believe a population entered Beringia, became geographically isolated, and then experienced evolutionary changes in their mitochondrial DNA during several thousand years, Chatters said. From there, multiple migrations may have taken people out of Beringia and to the Americas. "What this study is presenting for the first time is the evidence that Paleoamericans with those distinctive features can also be directly tied to the same Beringian source population as contemporary Native Americans," Bolnick said. Facial features may have evolved over time in response to such factors as changing climates and diets, Chatters said. Paleoamericans also have characteristics such as facial projection -- features such as mouth and eyes protruding from the skull -- that are related to aggression, a behavior that would be favorable in a migrating population, Chatters said. As groups settle down, however, docility tends to be advantageous. Why was Naia at the bottom of a pit?  The near-complete skeleton, dated to between 12,000 and 13,000 years old, was discovered in a pit that lies in an underwater cave system in a crevice the jungle floor about five miles from the Caribbean Sea. Traversing through a flooded tunnel, divers discovered this chamber that was so dark it seemed to absorb their underwater lights, Alberto Nava of Bay Area Underwater Explorers said at a press conference. They called it Hoyo Negro, which means Black Hole in Spanish. "The floor disappeared under us, and we could not see across to the other side. We pointed our lights down and to the sides. All we could see was darkness," said Nava, who is the co-director and lead diver for the Hoyo Negro Project. Nava's team found many of Naia's bones, as well as "a small cranium laying upside down with a perfect set of teeth and dark eye sockets looking back at us." They made this discovery in 2007. Most of the bones are still underwater, Chatters said. Scientists conducted the DNA analysis and age estimate based on one of Naia's wisdom teeth. "Recently, to protect the skull and some bones damaged by unauthorized visitors, we recovered them from the cave, but studies of those pieces have not yet begun," he said. This cave site was probably dry until about 10,000 years ago, when it flooded because of glacial melting, researchers said. There is evidence from the way that the bones are distributed in the cave, and iron oxide on the walls, that it contained "an ephemeral pool of water" that may have been filled by storms, Chatters said. We may never know why Naia died, but Chatters said it looks like she took a great fall into the pit, fracturing her pelvis. She would not have entered the cave system through a crevice in the jungle, as the divers did, but rather from a ground-level entrance, as the "ground" was lower than it is today.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/14/tech/web/apollo-space-auction/index.html	tech	For sale: Artifacts from Apollo lunar missions - CNN.com	2014/05/14	Wednesday May 14 06:09:20 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- If you have some disposable income and want to own a piece of aviation or space-exploration history, now's your chance. A metal fragment from the doomed Hindenburg airship, a signed photo of vanished pilot Amelia Earhart and items brought to the moon on the Apollo lunar missions are among hundreds of aviation- and space-related artifacts going on the auction block. Almost 600 items are being offered in RR Auction's Space & Aviation online sale, which begins Thursday and runs through May 22. For space enthusiasts, the highlights may be artifacts from NASA's Apollo lunar missions, including several pieces of rare equipment: -- A complete Apollo 15 Rotational Hand Controller used by Commander David Scott to fly and land his lunar module on the surface of the moon in 1971. Bidding starts at $10,000. -- A Crewman Optical Alignment Sight used by Scott for rendezvous, docking and star sightings during the lunar module phases of the mission. Bidding starts at $2,500. Both pieces came from Scott's personal collection and are likely to be prized by collectors. "These items represent the pinnacle of Apollo-era flown material," said Richard Jurek, co-author of "Marketing the Moon: The Selling of the Apollo Lunar Program." "While risking their lives during the most critical and historic phases of their mission, these are the items that the astronauts personally selected to retain as mementos from arguably the greatest technological and engineering achievement of the 20th century." Seventy items from Apollo 11 -- the first manned mission to land on the moon -- will be offered, including pieces from the personal collections of Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins. Items from other Apollo missions as well as Mercury, Gemini, and space shuttle missions also are being auctioned. Other artifacts include signed maps, patches, photos, and even a full spacesuit. RR Auction has been around for more than 30 years and specializes in rare documents, manuscripts, autographs and historical artifacts. This will be the site's seventh auction that has focused on human aviation and space exploration. Much of the equipment used on NASA missions has been left behind on the moon or sent drifting into the vastness of space. And many items that return from space missions are stored away in private collections or donated to museums, which is why rare auctions of spaceflight memorabilia draw interest from aviation enthusiasts. "Objects coming directly from moon walkers and that have been in private collections since returning to Earth are unquestionably the most sought after," said Bobby Livingston, executive vice present of RR Auction.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/14/tech/social-media/elon-musk-tesla-oatmeal/index.html	tech	Will Elon Musk fund a Nikola Tesla museum? - CNN.com	2014/05/14	Wednesday May 14 04:35:40 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Inventor Nikola Tesla may have died alone and broke, but he has powerful friends who want to preserve his legacy. Cartoonist Matthew Inman, the brain behind "The Oatmeal," is one. Using his popular web comic, Inman launched an effort to turn Tesla's former laboratory in Shoreham, New York, into a museum. Tesla, who lived from 1856 to 1943, developed the basis for AC power, among other ideas and innovations that have shaped our lives. He obtained more than 100 patents, according to the Tesla Memorial Society of New York. Inman partnered with the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe, a nonprofit group, to generate widespread interest in a museum. The cartoonist sang the inventor's praises in a humorous, profane comic hailing Tesla as superior to the better-known Thomas Edison ("Basically, Tesla = Nicest. Inventor. EVER," Inman wrote). Through the crowdfunding website Indiegogo, the nonprofit and Inman stirred up more than $1.3 million in 2012, when the facility and land were put up for sale. That was enough money to save the property, but not quite what was needed to renovate it for an actual museum. From grains of 'Oatmeal,' big things for cartoonist So this week Inman turned to a man who has become a household name in his own right: Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla Motors, which is named for the inventor. Inman published an Oatmeal comic called "What it's like to own a Tesla Model S," bursting with enthusiasm about owning the electric car, and then appealed to Musk in a second installment. "Elon Musk, if you're reading this: You owe us nothing, and you've done nothing but good things in the name of Nikola Tesla," Inman wrote in his endearing handwriting-esque typeface. "But the fact remains: Tesla Motors, a company now worth billions, is using Nikola Tesla's name and they're using his technology, and all we want in return is a little bit of help." Inman wrote that automobiles have AC induction motors and bear the Tesla name, despite the fact that no one from Nikola Tesla's family was involved in founding the car company. According to the Tesla Memorial Society of New York, Nikola Tesla invented the AC induction motor, which he sold to Westinghouse in 1888. "But the idea of a car company using someone else's family name without any formal connection to them is a slightly arresting notion," Inman wrote. "It would be like naming a company 'Steve Jobs Hoverbikes' 50 years from now, regardless of any ties to Apple or Jobs himself." During the initial fundraiser for the museum, Musk donated $2,500, Inman wrote. But what the Tesla Museum would need to open, he said, is another jolt of $8 million. Inman tweeted Tuesday "@elonmusk I wrote a review of my Model S, and then asked you for a little favor here [link]."  To the delight of many Twitter users, Musk tweeted back: "@Oatmeal I would be happy to help." Of course, we don't know if "help" means the full $8 million or much less. Musk's Tesla Motors declined to say how much Musk would donate. But for fans of Tesla's work and legacy, the possibility is electrifying.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/26/opinion/nicholson-va-money/index.html	opinion	Opinion: The VA has plenty of money, just bad leadership - CNN.com	2014/05/26	Monday May 26 01:26:04 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Alex Nicholson is legislative director at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- As politicians, pundits and the American people are focused on the escalating national crisis at the Department of Veterans Affairs, one excuse for the VA's woes keeps surfacing. Money. The VA, some say, needs more money to do its job and care for veterans properly. But looking at the facts, that math just does not add up. Since 2009, Congress has given Secretary Eric Shinseki every penny he has said he needed to fund the VA fully, resulting in an astonishing 50% increase in the agency's overall budget at a time when budgets everywhere else across the federal government have been squeezed, strained and slashed. Congress even exempted the VA from sequestration, a win that not even the Pentagon managed to score while still engaged in a war overseas. Congress also agreed to take the extraordinary step of giving the VA the annual funding it needs to cover veterans' health care a year in advance so that the agency's hospitals and clinics never run out of money. It is the reason the VA's health care system continued to operate without interruption during last fall's government shutdown, even as parks, federal buildings and congressional offices were forced to close or curtail operations for weeks. A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers in both the House and the Senate, with the strong support of virtually all veteran and military service organizations, has pushed for years to give the VA the rest of its budget a year in advance, too, but the secretary and the Obama administration thus far have refused to endorse publicly the wisdom of protecting the entire VA budget with an advance appropriation. Our gut reaction to contemporary social and bureaucratic challenges may be to throw more money at the problem or to blame Congress, but this is one situation in which such simple excuses fall far short. A lack of resources within the VA is not to blame for the failures of that department, and even if it were, the responsibility for that underfunding would lay solely at the feet of the secretary due to his inadequate budget requests, not with Congress. Far from being underfunded, the VA is facing woes that are clearly due to a failure of planning and leadership. The VA knew or should have known that demand for its services would swell as more troops survived the wars with more severe and chronic injuries, especially mental injuries. And with troop surges and drawdowns debated and planned well in advance, corresponding future demands on the VA system could -- and should -- have been anticipated. Since reports first emerged of veteran deaths during long waits and alleged mismanagement in Phoenix, there continues to be a profound and worrisome lack of thoughtful and proactive leadership coming out of the VA. Instead, the VA has been addressing problems in a predictable manner, first denying their existence, then downplaying the scale, then hunkering down in crisis mode and finally -- and belatedly -- coming forward with a tepid and weak public response. The passive, insular and arms-length management style has proven ill-suited for staying ahead of the pervasive problems of the nation's second-largest bureaucracy. But more importantly, the fear is that such detached leadership from the top may have caused the VA's bureaucratic and administrative pathologies to metastasize. Our nation made a promise to the men and women who served this nation. Tragically, the VA is falling short of this fulfilling this promise. This time, however, we cannot simply spend our way out of accountability and responsibility. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/23/opinion/davis-cuban-sterling/index.html	opinion	Opinion: Bias vs Bigot: Cuban is no Sterling - CNN.com	2014/05/23	Friday May 23 01:16:38 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Michaela Angela Davis, a writer and activist, was the executive fashion, beauty and culture editor at Essence, editor-in-chief of Honey magazine and fashion director for Vibe magazine. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- I am encouraged by Mark Cuban's clunky remarks. Granted, when Dallas Mavericks owner made statements about prejudice and Donald Sterling, they were insensitive and ironic. "If I see a black kid in a hoodie and it's late at night, I'm walking to the other side of the street," he said in an interview on inc.com, triggering fresh painful images of Trayvon Martin. He went on to say if he saw "a white guy with a shaved head and tattoos" he'd do the same thing. The irony is many members of the NBA are black, several white players have tattoos and many of them likely have a hoodie hanging in their lockers. However, Cuban was willing to be self-reflective in his attempt to voice his bias and made mistakes in that effort -- that is critically important to advancing our public discourse on the complexities of race in America. I don't think anyone can disagree at Cuban's basic premise that we all have some level of prejudice or bias. Yet what rouses emotions to a call for action is the most destructive and violent strains of prejudice, bigotry and racism. What we witnessed in the Donald Sterling interview with Anderson Cooper was not him trying to have an honest conversation about bias like Cuban; what we saw was a bigot in denial arguing his case to keep his property. That property otherwise known as the LA Clippers is slipping from him. Commissioner Adam Silver said Donald Sterling violated the NBA constitution and is confident the league will be able to force Sterling and his wife to sell the franchise. Sterling has lost his legacy and will be forever known as a disgrace to the NBA and an icon of ignorance. At this point, the best way Sterling could change the way he'll be remembered in history is to come clean. "Hi. My name is Donald Sterling. I am a racist. I need help." It's been said the worst thing to be labeled in America is racist. But why the worst? It certainly is not the most unnatural thing to be, especially if you're from a certain era or region. American history is steeped in racist institutions, ideology and imagery. Being a racist in America isn't the lowest, actually it's highly probable. Donald Sterling has proven to be an all-star racist and he is part of an American legacy. All men are created equal: An enlightened philosophy, yet a near impossible practice. Our revolutionary road towards equality is long, bloody, littered with hypocrisy and utterly beautiful. What makes this country great is not its perfect walk to freedom for all, but its commitment to paving the way mile by painful imperfect mile. Racists are not always hateful or uneducated -- they are complicated, resistant, underdeveloped people, often the product of complex, cruel, greedy times and institutions. The brutal business of slavery in the U.S. is older than its Constitution. The Declaration of Independence was drafted during the height of the transatlantic slave trade while also slaughtering millions of indigenous Americans. It's complicated. How can America expect its citizens not to be conflicted? The foundation of our mighty agricultural economy was built on the international institution of slavery. Strong black bodies were bought and sold to perform specific work, which they were able to do with superior efficacy. The extraordinary physical capabilities and the impressive capacity to adapt and innovate of black men (and women) made many white men very rich for many years. Donald Sterling is not so singular, not some ancient artifact -- he has built his wealth on an old successful American business model. He is not alone or fully to blame for his racist mentality. The belief that the best use of black and brown people is to serve, labor, produce and entertain is part of America's long history and continues to this day. There are obvious metaphors connecting antebellum plantation operations to Sterling's comments about his ownership of the LA Clippers. However, we don't have to look as far back as slavery for support for why his being a racist isn't shocking. Donald Sterling (born Donald Totowitz) was born in 1934. Brown v the Board of Education was in 1954. Rosa Parks was arrested in 1955 and the landmark civil rights decision in Loving v the State of Virginia happened in 1967. Sterling was an adult with a character and morals already formed before the arrival of the civil rights movement. The movement happened but it's naive to believe the whole country would move with it. Sterling lived and flourished during legal, government sanctioned discriminatory and racists policies. Wealth for the privileged white male can create a power buffer against the messy work of civil rights. Clearly Sterling is a shrewd businessman. So if there were no obvious or immediate benefit for him to have an awakening of equality, why would he? It pays for Sterling, and has for many others, to be racist. To declare, "I am not a racist" while clearly communicating racist beliefs is actually the worst. Adding insult to ignorance, Sterling said "I am not a racist" countless times during his interview with Anderson Cooper, alternating it with some of the most racists statements heard in mainstream media this century. Proclaiming, "I am not a racist " while proving your racist ideology is more insulting and more dangerous than actually being racist. Denial is more diabolical than ignorance. It prevents the possibility of education and evolution. It would be far more encouraging if the next Sterling would just come out say. "Yes, I am a racist". Or during the inevitable awkward public apology, instead of the expected and lame, "If I offended anybody I'm sorry," be courageous, admit it: "What I said was racist and I am sorry." Now that would be progress. It's also time for America to be really brave and take full responsibility for its racist past and current racist practices. To stop clutching its proverbial pearls every time one of our neighbors or leaders or landlords exposes their racist education. Our collective denial is stalling our advancement to a more perfect union. Donald Sterling is accomplished and educated, so one can only imagine the beliefs of the scores of less fortunate and underexposed. Numerous white supremacist groups are thriving right in our back yards. They too are citizens stuck in time, pathetically clinging to a bitter romanticized past where America was ruled solely by white males. Racists or people holding racist beliefs have to stop being cowards, face their racism and be willing to recover so we can all can get down to the better business of creating a land of the free home of the brave. Being a racist is not the worst. Lying about it, denying it and refusing recovery is. Admitting racism may very well be the first and critical step to actually ending it.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/23/us/california-kidnap-victim-found-knight/index.html	us	Michelle Knight: Stop doubting California woman on kidnapping - CNN.com	2014/05/23	Friday May 23 08:36:58 EDT 2014	"She had plenty of time to actually escape so it's hard to believe this is really going on because she had a lot of free time." Authorities have acknowledged that the woman said she reached out to her family before she went to police. A photo posted on Facebook purports to show her with her mother and sister on on Mother's Day -- one week before she went to authorities. A post in Spanish that accompanies the photo on Facebook reads: "After almost 10 years after not seeing my mom and little sister." CNN cannot confirm the date of the photo, and police and the prosecutor's office declined Friday to comment further on the details of the case. Garcia's attorney, Charles Frisco, said Friday he hasn't had much time to talk to his client but said stories such as the neighbor's make him doubt the state's case. "If you listen to what they have to say, it sounds like he's not guilty and it's all fabricated," Frisco told CNN. Knight has just one answer to those doubting the woman's story: You couldn't possibly understand. "Just because you're not chained up and you're not locked in the basement doesn't mean you ain't trapped," she told CNN's Kate Bolduan. "I know exactly what it feels like to be trapped in your own mind, your emotional mind, and told you can't do anything about it, nobody will care about what you say." Knight was held in Ariel Castro's Cleveland home from August 2002 until May 2013, when her fellow captive Amanda Berry summoned help from a neighbor to break out of the locked house. Sometimes chained, frequently brutalized, Knight said the worst part of her decade of captivity was the isolation and the psychological manipulation her captor held over her. "I was threatened to be killed. I was threatened that nobody cared about me," she said. "For a girl like her, the emotional torture is so painful that she chose not to hurt other people," Knight said. "Because he may have threatened to hurt her, he may have threatened to hurt the people that she was talking to." Elizabeth Smart, who also was abducted, had a similar message in an interview Thursday with Chris Cuomo on "New Day." "Well, as a survivor who has been chained up in physical chains and also had the chains of threats held over me, I can tell you firsthand that threat is so much stronger than physical chains," said Smart, who was abducted from her Salt Lake City home in 2002. "Now, I don't have intimate details on what threats he was holding over her head, but I understand that he was holding her family, that he was threatening her family and, for me, that was the strongest threat anyone could have ever made to me," she said. Knight said she worries that questions such as those raised about the California woman's case will keep other people suffering from abuse from coming forward and seeking help. "You're making people not want to come out, not want to say anything," she said, her voice breaking. "You're making people want to sit there and keep it to themselves and go through the abuse when you say stupid crap like that." The California woman's alleged captor, Garcia, 42, was arrested during a traffic stop Wednesday. He is charged with a felony count of forcible rape, three felony counts of lewd acts on a minor and a felony count of kidnapping to commit a sexual offense. If convicted of all three crimes, he could face life in prison. CNN's Kyung Lah and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report. 
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/22/opinion/sutter-same-sex-marriage-pennsylvania-oregon/index.html	opinion	Opinion: Yay for same-sex marriage, but ... - CNN.com	2014/05/22	Thursday May 22 07:48:50 EDT 2014	Editor's note: John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion and creator of CNN's Change the List project. Follow him on Twitter, Facebook or Google+. E-mail him at ctl@cnn.com. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- There's plenty of gay-rights news to celebrate this week: -- On Monday, a federal judge threw out Oregon's ban on same-sex marriages, writing that his decision was one in support of "families committed to the common purpose of love, devotion and service to the greater community." -- On Tuesday, the same thing, more or less, happened in Pennsylvania, with a judge in that case writing that "we are a better people than what these laws represent, and it is time to discard them into the ash heap of history." (I mean, wow, right?) -- And, for those would might say "activist judges" are behind all of this progress, please note that Gallup on Wednesday released data showing 55% of Americans -- a greater percentage than ever shown in that group's polling -- support same-sex marriage rights. So, in summary: The era of same-sex marriage is upon us; even those who grimaced at NFL player Michael Sam's boyfriend kiss probably can see that; and, therefore, all's well that ends well. Well, not so much. In the march toward marriage equality, the United States skipped over other rights that are more fundamental and perhaps more essential for LGBT people. Consider three facts: 1. It's legal for employers to fire gay and lesbian people because of their sexual orientation in not one or two fringe states but in 29 of them, according to the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights advocacy group that tracks these things. That's a majority of states where it's legal to fire someone simply for being gay. "It's important to note that, while same-sex couples can legally marry today in Pennsylvania, they can actually be fired from their jobs for talking about their new spouses at work," Charlie Joughin, spokesman for HRC, wrote in an e-mail to me. Related: No one should be fired for being gay 2. Related to that, there also are 29 states where it's legal for landlords to evict gay and lesbian residents simply because of their sexual orientation. That's true not just of places such as Mississippi but also states with more progressive reputations, such as Pennsylvania and Michigan. 3. Some states make it onerously difficult, if not impossible, for transgender people to legally change their names and update the gender that's listed on their state ID or driver's license. Maybe that sounds inconsequential, but consider going to the airport with an ID that doesn't match who you are and having to explain your gender identity to a TSA agent. "There are 15 (states) that we would give an F" on these issues, said Harper Jean Tobin, director of policy at the National Center for Transgender Equality. Progress is coming but much too slowly in some cases. The first employment nondiscrimination laws were passed in East Lansing and Ann Arbor, Michigan, according to Michael Bronski's "A Queer History of the United States." The year was 1972. A range of cities and corporations have come up with their own nondiscrimination policies and rules in the decades since, but state and federal movement has been sluggish. The Employment Nondiscrimination Act passed the U.S. Senate last year but has been a nonstarter in House, thanks to Speaker John Boehner. To be fair, there are campaigns from LGBT rights groups to put in place these basic protections. The Human Rights Campaign, for instance, started Project One America to "dramatically expand LGBT equality in the South," including freedom from discrimination, which is rampant in that region. But it's clear marriage equality has been the primary focus, for the public, activists and for the news media. There are some reasonable explanations for that. Some would argue, for instance, that campaigns for marriage equality have helped people realize gay and lesbian people are loving and family-oriented -- and that greater protections will follow that awakening. I hope that's right, but it's no sure thing. We're starting to see ourselves in America as a beacon of progressiveness and opportunity for LGBT people. But we also need to acknowledge the reality -- which is that this also is a country where basic protections remain worryingly absent.

She also is a principal at the Baker Wright Group, a communications and public relations firm. You can follow her on Twitter @GOPBlackChick. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- Not even a week after the ruling in the Trayvon Martin trial, President Barack Obama couldn't wait to stand before the White House press corps and "speak to an issue that obviously has gotten a lot of attention," as he said last July. Yet it took Obama more than a month to address the crisis where 40 veterans allegedly died while waiting months for treatment at a Phoenix Veterans Administration hospital. Congress has held hearings on the grave matter since April and called Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki among other witnesses to testify. But Obama just got around to holding a press conference Wednesday on the topic. "So when I heard allegations of misconduct -- any misconduct, whether it's allegations of VA staff covering up long wait times or cooking the books -- I will not stand for it, not as commander in chief, but also not as an American," Obama declared. If Obama is as outraged and "mad as hell" as he professes, why did it take him over a month to say anything substantive about vets dying because of months waiting for care? Prior to his long overdue press conference about the VA controversy, Obama only mentioned what has now become another White House scandal in a response to a question from a reporter on April 28 during his Asia trip. During his press conference, Obama said he wasn't going to jump to any conclusions or call for any resignations until "the investigators do their job and get to the bottom of what happened" at the VA. He added, "we have to find out, first of all, what exactly happened." In contrast, Obama couldn't wait to jump to conclusions and comment on the shooting of the black teen Martin by George Zimmerman before any investigation or trial happened. Obama made extensive comments on the shooting in March 2012 in the Rose Garden. "You know, if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon. All of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves," he said. Well we certainly didn't hear the president say, if he had served in the military, "I could have been one of those veterans who died." Apparently, veterans, who put their lives at risk defending our country then died at the hands of incompetent VA employees aren't worthy of the same attention and "seriousness" as Trayvon Martin? Even more indicative of the Obama White House's misplaced priorities is the White House issued a statement from the president on the day of the Tryavon Martin trial verdict last July. No White House statement was issued about the VA allegations. But clearly a statement on the Martin trial wasn't enough. A few days later, Obama held a press conference about the verdict. "I thought it might be useful for me to expand on my thoughts a little bit," Obama noted. Martin's death, though tragic, had nothing to do with national security or government malfeasance and didn't warrant attention from the president of the United States. But Obama felt it was very important to comment on the death of a young black man shot by a "white Hispanic" to appease race hucksters like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson who helped elect him. Stammering throughout his VA press conference Wednesday, Obama told reporters "responsibility for things always rests ultimately with me, as the President and commander in chief." At the same time Obama claims he didn't know how big the problems were with the VA. How can a president be responsible for problems occurring at agencies if he's not aware of the problems? This sounds like the all-too-familiar refrain the White House uses. It didn't know about the IRS scandal or the Department of Health and Human Services' disastrous rollout of Obamacare. Again, Obama promised, "there is going to be accountability." "Listen, if somebody has mismanaged or engaged in misconduct, not only do I not want them getting bonuses, I want them punished," he said from the White House briefing room. Hopefully this time, the President means what he says because in past scandals he has held no one accountable. IRS division director Lois Lerner and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius both were allowed to resign without accountability. Shinseki eventually will do the same. Regardless of the outcome of the investigation, at minimum our veterans deserve the same attention to their deaths as Obama gave Trayvon. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/22/living/bad-mother-judge-women-parents/index.html	living	De Blasio bad mother fall-out: Why are we so quick to condemn? - CNN.com	2014/05/22	Thursday May 22 08:24:51 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. She is a mom of two. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter. (CNN) -- If I were to admit what went on in my house this morning -- how I raised my voice more than once and slammed the kitchen cabinets after my 8-year-old daughter kept talking back to me -- how many people would think I'm a "bad mother"? Probably more than a few. I bring up the issue after something that took place very publicly involving the new first lady of New York City, Chirlane McCray, wife of Mayor Bill de Blasio. In an in-depth profile in New York magazine on her upbringing, professional experience and relationship with her husband, McCray talks oh-so-briefly (one paragraph in a six-page piece) about how she struggled with the weight of the responsibilities and the loss of some of her independence when her first child, Chiara, was born in 1994. READ: Longing for the carefree parenting style of yesterday? "I was 40 years old. I had a life. Especially with Chiara -- will we feel guilty forever more? Of course, yes. But the truth is, I could not spend every day with her. I didn't want to do that. I looked for all kinds of reasons not to do it," said McCray. "I love her. I have thousands of photos of her -- every 1-month birthday, 2-month birthday. But I've been working since I was 14, and that part of me is me. It took a long time for me to get into 'I'm taking care of kids,' and what that means." She never said she was a bad mother, mind you, but that didn't stop one New York City tabloid from using the label. On the front page of the New York Post, along with a picture of McCray, was this nearly full-page headline: "I Was a Bad Mom!" The New York Daily News had a slightly more restrained take with a smaller photograph on its front page, along with the headline, "Didn't want to be a mom." READ: Memo to imperfect moms The coverage prompted an unusual move by the mayor, calling a press conference just to denounce the tabloids and demand an apology to his wife. A features editor at the Daily News, who is a new mom herself and just back from maternity leave, defended the coverage in a post, saying the papers didn't make the story up. It is what McCray said. "Chirlane, you're probably a good mother. Maybe even a great one. But that doesn't mean you get to fret about your performance  then complain at how people discuss it," said Raakhee Mirchandani, the Daily News features editor. But is that what happened? Here was a woman speaking candidly and expressing something that a lot of women can probably relate to and then the media jumped in, using the words "bad mom" and suggesting she didn't want to be a mom, when that's not the case. Would the media or anyone else, for that matter, do the same if a man admitted he struggled with balancing parenthood and his professional life, or if he realized he didn't want to spend every waking moment with his kids? You know the answer. READ: Are millennial moms more traditional? "Society has this just general obsession with the dichotomy of motherhood, good versus bad, and we have this failure to see women as whole beings with motherhood only making up one aspect," said Avital Norman Nathman, editor of "The Good Mother Myth: Redefining Motherhood to Fit Reality." "Instead, motherhood always gets pushed front and center and then it becomes judged, whether you are excelling or not." Rebecca Levey, a mom of twins and co-founder of a video sharing site for tweens called KidzVuz, said the whole brouhaha reminds her way too much of a former first lady. "This sounds so much like when Hillary Clinton said I'm sorry I didn't stay home and make chocolate chip cookies ... and then she had to go freakin' make chocolate chip cookies and put out chocolate chip cookie recipes," said Levey, who hosted a parent blogger roundtable earlier this year at City Hall with the mayor and his wife. READ: Are money-making moms less happy? What these stories do, women say, is make other moms feel less confident to speak out about how motherhood, for them, might not be "this cookie cutter, sugar coated version," said Norman Nathman, who also hosts a blog called The Mamafesto. "How many people complain about their jobs and nobody questions their ability to do X, Y and Z?" she said. "But yet when it comes to motherhood, where we've placed all this pressure on parents and specifically, obviously women to turn out amazing kids, any kind of negative comment and we're blasted." There has been a trend, Levey said, of female bloggers and authors writing sarcastically about what a bad mother they are, almost making it "cool" to be the "griping mom." But get serious and the response is not quite the same, she said. "If you actually admit that maybe on a real level, you think, 'Oh my God, maybe I really messed up (as a mom),' that's not OK," said Levey. "So you can be snarky and sarcastic but you can't be honest." Katharine Zaleski, mom to a 5-month-old, said as a new mom she totally gets what McCray was saying. "You work like crazy to get to where you are and then the most wonderful event in your life, the birth of your child, completely rips you from the world you strived to rise in." READ: OMG! Your teen actually talks to you? "Frankly, I feel sorry for women who can't express what McCray did," said Zaleski, who is co-founder and president of Power to Fly, a new company connecting women and moms with job opportunities. "To me, that says they don't feel comfortable talking about the lives they built before motherhood and their goals post-baby. Furthermore, when has it been good for children to have mothers who pretend they don't have a life beyond them?" Jennifer Bosse, a mom of two, ages 1 and 3, went back to work when her firstborn was 7 weeks old. She questioned her desire to work, and her desire to be home, and ultimately decided to stay home full-time and become a freelance writer, creating a blog called Defining My Happy. "Motherhood is not all sunshine and rainbows," said Bosse on Facebook. "It's tough. It's heartbreaking. Sometimes I need time away to re-group. Does that make me a bad mother, too? Absolutely not. We're human." What do you think it will take to stop labeling women as "bad mothers"? Chime in in the comments or tell Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/us/violin-plane-viral-video/index.html	us	$250,000 violin gets musical virtuosos bumped off flight - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 04:11:28 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- It's a good thing Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart doesn't have an Internet connection. If he could see what happened to Zachary De Pue this week, he might turn over in his grave.   A video is going viral of violin virtuoso De Pue stranded on the tarmac of Charlotte, North Carolina's airport Monday, playing his heart out in indignation -- on a priceless violin. His fiddle is worth more than $250,000. It's the reason De Pue, the Concertmaster of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, didn't make the plane. A flight attendant on the US Airways flight to Fayetteville, Arkansas, wouldn't let De Pue take the precious violin on board with him. He insisted he turn the sensitive instrument in as checked baggage. For De Pue, it was out of the question that the violin be tossed into the cargo bay. He did not mention which violin he was carrying. But according to the orchestra's website and that of the band he was traveling with Monday, De Pue plays a violin made by master luthier Ferdinand Gagliano in 1757, the year after Mozart was born. Time for Three De Pue and fellow violinist Nick Kendall are part of a string trio called Time for Three, along with bassist Ranaan Meyer, whom they were on their way to meet. Kendall was also carrying a valuable violin on board, but neither could convince the crew that their precious cargo would fit in the overhead bins. The pilot apologized, Kendall said, and told them the FAA mandates that musical instruments cannot be carried on the plane. If federal agents discovered a violation, a fine of $10,000 would follow. The two got off the plane. Cap, T-shirt, jogging pants The youthful looking De Pue told HLN's Right this Minute that he didn't feel they were being taken seriously. Standing on the tarmac in his Ninja Turtles T-shirt and jogging pants, with a baseball cap on backward, his appearance was a far cry from the clich of an elegantly dressed Concertmaster. But De Pue is used to breaking the mold with his trio, especially musically. On their historic string instruments, they love to stroke out country music, bluegrass and jazz, or improvise their own hybrids in jam sessions. De Pue decided to appeal to the pilot's ears, and whipped out the invaluable violin. "Film this man," he told Kendall, who pulled out a cell phone. "I'm going to play for them, and maybe that will get their attention." The intention was clear -- online retribution. "We're gonna post this. This is gonna be something that everybody talks about," Kendall said. De Pue's agile bow and nimble fingers toned out a classical aria over the blunting roar of the jet engines, as the last of the crew boarded. Rectifying rules The music touched the right ears. US Airways put the two on a later flight with their precious instruments as carry-ons and issued a mea culpa. "We sincerely apologize for not only their delay, but what occurred at the airport," said Bill McGlashen, a spokesman for US Airways. He cited varying regulations as the reason the two could not carry the instruments aboard the first flight, but were allowed to take them on the second. It wasn't the last run-in De Pue and Kendall would have over the priceless violins. On the next flight they took, the same thing nearly happened again, De Pue and Kendall said,when a ticket agent asked them to turn in their instruments as checked baggage. But this time, they were prepared. They had studied FAA regulations and found a 2012 adjustment in the rules, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act. It allowed them to carry their instruments on board, they said. They showed the regulations to the agent, they said. It did the trick.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/26/living/teen-builds-tiny-house-schools/index.html	living	Teen builds tiny house: School project becomes memorial to dad - CNN.com	2014/05/26	Monday May 26 08:29:38 EDT 2014	Marietta, Georgia (CNN) -- As the school year came to a close, 12-year-old Sicily Kolbeck found herself still without a project. It was a key requirement at the small, independent school she attended just outside Atlanta. If she found the right one -- something big and passion-driven -- it could set the course for her entire next academic year. She thought maybe she could start a natural makeup line or dive into some type of research. Or she could just keep wasting time online. As she clicked around, she stumbled into the idea of tiny houses -- dwellings that pack the conveniences of modern homes into a couple hundred square feet. She found a rabid community around them, blogs and documentaries filled with DIY builders and eco-lovers and folks who lived happily with less. This could be it, Sicily thought. She'd hardly swung a hammer before, but maybe she could build a tiny house. She remembered "renovating" the loft in their old barn to make it homier, and how she once turned a massive TV box into a personal playhouse, complete with a doorbell and place settings at the table. Tiny houses became a bit of an obsession, and just in time for school. "This was the only idea I had," confessed Sicily, who recently turned 14. READ: Do students need to sit still in class? Her parents didn't blink. It was perfect. It didn't matter that Sicily was a child. She craved independence and a space of her own, she said -- something that would be all hers. Sicily would be the architect, builder, fund-raiser and client. Her mother and teacher who had founded her school, Suzannah Kolbeck, would serve as the project manager, the guide to making plans and reaching milestones. She would help create a budget and manage the science and art that goes into constructing a home. Dane Kolbeck, Sicily's dad, would help with the hands-on. He was a sailor and woodworker with a great collection of tools, but he'd never built a house, and certainly not with a middle-schooler in charge. He would provide the guidance needed to get the project off the ground, and although they didn't know it at the time, the spark to finish it, even after unimaginable tragedy. She launched a blog, La Petite Maison, a nod to the French classes her mother insisted she take, and an Indiegogo fund-raising campaign that quickly exceeded its $1,500 goal. She drew clumsy blueprints -- piles and piles of possibilities -- then built scale models and a birdhouse that introduced her to power tools. The first few weeks of construction in January 2013 were rocky. Dane was impatient, and it was hard for him not to snatch the buzzing tools away from his daughter. Meanwhile, Sicily was exasperated when his well-trained hands homed in on her house. It took a little while, but they were starting to understand how to work together. "He kind of taught me a lot of the lingo -- flush, plumb, even, straight, square," Sicily said. "If somebody needs something jigsawed, I got that on lock now. I can figure it out, whatever it is. There was a lot of figuring things out." Then everything came to a halt when Suzannah's phone rang around 4 a.m. February 16. She was out of town, caring for a relative. An unfamiliar voice told her Sicily was safe in bed at home, but Dane had been in a car accident. The whole idea of home, tiny or otherwise, shook: Suzannah's husband and Sicily's father was gone. 'It's all about the try' In the first blank hours, the mother and daughter just sat on the couch at home. There was bawling, and sometimes silence. Text messages and phone calls came, then trickles of friends and family, then streams. They ate whatever food people brought and drank whatever coffee was made, and talked about Dane, or avoided talk about him. They played, by Sicily's estimate, 20 million games of gin rummy. After a few days, Luke Bair, like everyone else, was desperate for another distraction. He's an old friend of the Kolbecks, a homebuilder by trade who encouraged the family to take on the tiny house project, and tweaked some of the early blueprints and plans. He'd seen Dane and Sicily just a few weeks earlier, when they picked up a trailer that would bear the load of the tiny house. When he looked out the window, he saw the unfinished work of his best friend and the dashed childhood of a young girl. "We can sit around here and whine and cry and sob and tell stories and drink beer and do whatever we have to do," he remembers saying. "We can also just start working on the project." They trudged to Home Depot, bought materials and began construction once again. Sicily embraced the distraction and direction -- and the help. It seemed everyone who stopped by drove in a nail or raised a board. Within a few days, there was a shell of a small home in the backyard. Inside the pine and plywood, Sicily could see her home in three dimensions. READ: What kids can learn from failure But as mourners dispersed, there was no life as usual at home. School didn't resonate like before for teacher or student. Suzannah calculated that she couldn't possibly be a single parent and a school principal. She placed her small school on hiatus, uncertain it would ever come back. For Sicily, the academic year faded to an end. They tiny house sat outside, untouched. That spring and summer, Sicily's competitive softball team, the Georgia Titans, helped ground her in the moment. She's a catcher, a team leader -- but she wasn't really herself. Her dad had been a coach, and she still listened for his booming voice and sailor's mouth from the dugout. She turned up at tournaments without her cleats, socks or sunscreen. Eating on the road, she wouldn't order her own meals. She stopped making decisions, small or large. She cried more. "She started saying, 'I can't' a lot," said Suzannah, 43. "And I started saying, 'I can't,' too, 'but it's all about the try.' We have to make decisions about what we we're going to do." On a break between sports and school, mother and daughter decided they needed to leave. They took a trip, just the two of them on the road for five weeks, crashing at friends' homes from North Carolina to Philadelphia. Suzannah drove, Sicily directed. To navigate every traffic jam or country road, they needed each other. "He used to drive, and she would be the navigator," Sicily said of her parents. "Now I was the navigator. I could no longer live with indecision." The trip pulled them away from home -- the "big" house where they'd lived with Dane and the tiny house they'd all planned to build together. But when the road led them back to Georgia, they looked back at the plywood husk in the yard and made a decision. It was time to rebuild. 'The act is more powerful than the product' Once again, construction began, and this time, it wasn't just Sicily, or just her family. Sicily and Suzannah became regular posters to tiny house Facebook groups; a simple question could draw dozens of creative answers. Friends and a few experts pitched in; a retiree with building skills showed Sicily how to wire the house; the workers at the local Home Depot taught them how to plumb the kitchen and bathroom. A roofer donated time and materials to top the house (the only part Suzannah refused to let her teen handle on her own.) "People just showed up, resources just showed up," said Andrew Odom, creator of the blog Tiny r(E)volution, who met the Kolbecks when Sicily first planned her tiny house. "They thought they were going to go at it just as a family. They didn't know how much they needed a community. "The project could have easily been scrapped. Whether she ever lives in it or not, it bears the touch of everyone special in her life time, including her dad." Education experiment: Cutting out the classroom There was still a lot for Sicily to learn, but the project was no longer about school. Finishing meant hours and days of focus, frustration and sometimes weeping and screaming. It meant working around her tiny house's crooked corners, rebuilding a rickety staircase and painting about a dozen coats of white on the yellow pine paneling inside. Sicily labored over how to fit an oddly shaped window into the loft. She was a pro at fitting squares and rectangles, but this one was special; it came from her dad's boat. "It wasn't until later ... probably these past couple months that I realized why I'm doing this," Sicily said. "I'm doing it to show him that I can do stuff, to show him that I am capable and he doesn't need to yell at me when I can't use the drill." Others touched Sicily's house through dollars donated, advice offered and help volunteered. That, as much as the construction, was where the learning came in, said family friend Luke Bair. That's where the healing happened, too. It came when a girl and her mom shimmed the windows or tacked on the siding, and when friends old and new rallied to help them along. The house isn't a memorial to Dane, Bair said. Building it was. "It's not dreams anymore. It's skill. The act is more powerful than the product," Bair said. "Regardless of what it looks like and who appreciates it, the process had to be done." 'Who would have thought I would finish?' In April, after the final coats were painted, fresh gray curtains were hung and a few throw pillows fluffed, it was official. "My house is DONE," Sicily wrote on her blog. "Yes, yes, yes. I know. Who would have thought I would finish? Not me. Just kidding. (Kind of.)" She's 14 now, and the owner of a 128-square foot tiny home with a fully functional kitchen and bathroom, a queen-sized bed for sleeping and closets and cubbies for storage. It took a year and a half and nearly $10,000 to pull it off. READ: Kids show they're never too young to be CEO For now, it lives in the Kolbeck's backyard in Georgia. They don't live in it full time, but it's a cozy escape when the world feels too big and the ground too shaky. This summer, it will move with the Kolbecks when they return to Suzannah's hometown of Baltimore. There, Sicily will attend a public high school, play softball and consider her next project; she'd like to rebuild an old Volkswagen Beetle. "We're able to leave because it's done," Suzannah said. "To have given up would've felt wrong, just a reminder that we didn't do something, that we'd been beaten by this awful event, that we didn't care. We're able to leave because it's done." Home, Sicily knows now, can go anywhere with her. "I don't think I'm ever going to be 100% great, or 100% OK," Sicily said. "It's not like learning how to forget him, but learning how to go through life remembering him -- and still kind of living and being happy." What was the most memorable project of your school years?

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/justice/california-elliot-rodger-wealth/index.html	crime	Elliot Rodger's family struggled with money, court documents show - CNN.com	2014/05/27	Tuesday May 27 09:38:12 EDT 2014	Los Angeles (CNN) -- Despite his designer clothes and BMW, Isla Vista shooting suspect Elliot Rodger was not from a wealthy family. Rodger's father, a photographer and film director, was deeply in debt, and his mother made just $40,000 a year as a research assistant for a film company, according to documents from his parents' divorce. Santa Barbara County, California, investigators say Rodger, 22, stabbed to death three people in his apartment, shot two women to death outside a sorority house and killed another man inside a deli with gunfire before apparently killing himself near the campus of the University of California at Santa Barbara on Friday. Timeline to 'Retribution': Isla Vista attacks planned over years The 107,000-word "story" that Rodger sent to his parents, therapists and several others just before the killings suggested that he was angry that his parents were not wealthy. "Where's the justice? I thought. Why couldn't I have been born into that life?" Rodger wrote. His father's family in Britain "was once part of the wealthy upper classes before they lost all of their fortune during the Great Depression," he wrote. Rodger's mother and father had rich friends in Los Angeles, which allowed him to sometimes enjoy the benefits of money, such as tickets to a private Katy Perry concert in 2012. "I tried to pretend as if I was part of a wealthy family," he wrote about that night. "I should be. That was the life I was meant to live. I WOULD BE!" He blamed his parents for his lack of wealth. "If only my damnable mother had married into wealth instead of being selfish," he wrote. She dated wealthy men after her divorce, giving her son hope and prompting him to "pester" her to marry one, he said. "I will always resent my mother for refusing to do this. If not for her sake, she should have done it for mine. Joining a family of great wealth would have truly saved my life. I would have a high enough status to attract beautiful girlfriends and live above all of my enemies." His father also failed him, he wrote. "If only my failure of a father had made better decisions with his directing career instead wasting his money on that stupid documentary." The documentary -- a film about celebrities' view of God titled "Oh My God" -- plunged his father into debt when Rodger was a teenager and caused him to stop paying child support, according to court papers. "My business has not generated any income in over a year," Peter Rodger said in a 2009 filing asking the judge to modify his $2,000 a month child support payments for his two children. "As a result, I currently receive no income from any source. I am searching for employment, but have been unable to find a job." His mother noted that her former husband used the equity in his home to finance the documentary, but she agreed to a one-year suspension of child support. With her monthly income just $3,200 a month, she said had to "depend in the generosity of family and friends to make ends meet." It was his working mother's generosity to her adult son, including paying his rent and the gift of a used BMW 328i, that allowed Rodger to live in the college community of Isla Vista. He bought his three handguns with money saved from gifts from grandparents and the $500 a month his father sent him, according to Rodger's writing. Five revelations from the 'twisted world' of a 'kissless virgin' He became obsessed with gaining wealth as the "only way I could lose my virginity, the only way I could have the beautiful girlfriend I know I deserve." "I had no talents, so it was impossible for me to become a professional actor, musician, or athlete; and those were usually the ways that young people acquired such money," he wrote. "I could invent something, or start a business just like Mark Zuckerberg did with Facebook, but the chances of me achieving such a thing were the same chances I had of winning the lottery anyway." He played California's Mega Millions lottery whenever the jackpot rose above $100 million. He drove to Arizona four times to buy Powerball lottery chances. He went into a rage each time he did not win. "Without the prospect of becoming wealthy at a young age, I had nothing to live for now," Rodger wrote. "I was going to be a virgin outcast forever. I realized that I had to start planning and preparing for the Day of Retribution, even though I hadn't yet had any idea of what day that would be." The divorce documents also confirmed that Elliot Rodger was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, a form of autism, when he was 7. "Elliot has special needs," his mother said in a sworn statement. "He is a high functioning autistic child." That he was autistic should not lead to a conclusion that autism had any connection to the attacks, according to Scott Badesch, the president of the Autism Society of America. "Reputable study after study has concluded there is no such link."  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/us/new-york-police-heroin-antidote/index.html	us	NYPD receives funding to equip officers with heroin antidote naloxone - CNN.com	2014/05/27	Tuesday May 27 03:55:28 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- The New York Police Department, the largest police force in the United States, announced Tuesday that it has received funding to equip close to 20,000 officers with naloxone, a heroin antidote that can instantly reverse the effects of an overdose. State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman declared that his office would provide the funding of more than $1.1 million to equip and train the NYPD officers as part of the Community Overdose Prevention Program. "By providing NYPD police officers with naloxone, we are making this stunningly effective overdose antidote available in every corner of the five boroughs. This program will literally save lives," Schneiderman said at a press conference. Each naloxone kit consists of a zip bag or pouch containing two pre-filled syringes of naloxone, two atomizers for nasal administration, sterile gloves and a booklet on the use of the drug, according to a statement from Schneiderman's office. The emergency treatment works like the well-known EpiPen -- an epinephrine auto-injector for serious allergic reactions -- as it is injected into the muscle and does not require training, making it more user-friendly. Once injected, the naloxone stops heroin and other opioids from slowing a person's breathing down to the point that it stops. The FDA approved the prescription treatment after just 15 weeks under priority status. Currently, most law enforcement agencies are using the nasal spray version of the antidote, which is slightly different than the auto-injector. How heroin kills you "A recent pilot project in Staten Island has already proven effective with several overdose victims," said NYPD Commissioner William Bratton, who did not have an exact time frame of when the officers would officially be equipped. The training for each officer takes roughly 45 minutes, Bratton said. Joining Schneiderman and Bratton at the announcement was Carol Christiansen, co-founder of Drug Crisis in Our Backyard. Christiansen's son, a former NYPD detective, died of a heroin overdose in 2012. Erik, 28, injured his back at the gym and became addicted to oxycodone for the pain, which led to an eventual addiction to heroin. "It's an epidemic I think everybody should be aware of," Christiansen said, who believes the real problem is the poor monitoring of prescription medication. Schneiderman also led the effort to pass legislation to create I-STOP, a monitoring program that prevents individuals from going from doctor to doctor to accumulate multiple prescriptions. "If the I-STOP law was in effect over two years ago possibly my son, Erik, would be alive today," Christiansen said. The police department of Quincy, Massachusetts, was the first in the nation to require its officers to carry naloxone and has successfully reversed 211 overdoses with a success rate of over 95%. In New York's Suffolk County, 563 lives were saved last year alone, the statement said. "Equipping the NYPD with naloxone is a tremendously important step in the fight against New York's growing opioid addiction epidemic," said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, chief medical officer of Phoenix House in Manhattan.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/26/us/travis-mills-rowe/index.html	us	Quadruple amputee Travis Mills stuns Mike Rowe: 'I'm not a victim' - CNN.com	2014/05/26	Monday May 26 10:37:20 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Travis Mills has no arms or legs. He is an American hero who served three tours in Afghanistan and lost all his limbs when a bomb exploded under him. "How I survived, I have no idea," he said. "I was yelling at the medic, 'Get away from me,' because I thought I was done." The retired United States Army staff sergeant spent months recuperating at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, but don't dare call him a wounded warrior. "I'm not wounded any more," he said. "I'm just a guy living life." Recalling comrades killed in combat, he asks: "How selfish would it be if I gave up?" He snowboards, bikes and recently jumped out of an airplane with the U.S. Army Golden Knights parachute team. And now, he has a new admirer in Mike Rowe, the star of "Dirty Jobs" and the upcoming CNN series "Somebody's Gotta Do It." He met Mills a few weeks ago at a conference in Washington and wrote a Facebook post about their exchange to honor him this Memorial Day. As of Monday night, the post had more than 90,000 shares on Facebook. "He has a motto: Never give up - never quit. He has a Foundation. He's featured in a new documentary. He also has a wife and a kid, and a deeply personal commitment to help other wounded vets cope with their injuries." Rowe wrote. "But when I asked why I hadn't seen him in any of the typical commercials and PSA's for wounded veterans, his answer was stunning. He said he didn't consider himself to be wounded. 'I'm not a victim, Mike. And I refuse to be portrayed that way. Case closed.'" Rowe ended his candid post by reflecting on the holiday meant to honor America's military fallen. "That's called a gut-check, and I could use one from time to time. Especially on Memorial Day, when the biggest decisions I face are what to grill and which type of frosty beverage to enjoy. This year, as I resolve these and other important issues, I'll think of Travis Mills." The toll of war now includes more amputees CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report. 
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/business/google-driverless-cars/index.html	iBUSINESS	Google's new car: No driver, and no steering wheel - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 07:24:59 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Google has revealed a prototype of its latest driverless car -- and this one doesn't even have a steering wheel. The car will only have a stop and go button. No steering wheel. No pedals. Unlike Google's previous self-driving vehicles, which have been based on conventional cars adapted to navigate around without a driver, this model has been designed from scratch. "They won't have a steering wheel, accelerator pedal, or brake pedal... because they don't need them," Google said in a statement. The car can carry two passengers and has a maximum speed of 25 miles per hour. Google says the car's most important feature is its safety. "They have sensors that remove blind spots, and they can detect objects out to a distance of more than two football fields in all directions, which is especially helpful on busy streets with lots of intersections," the company said. With its front designed to look like a friendly smiley face, the Google autonomous car is not just efficient and futuristic, but also cute to look at. Google said it planned to build around 100 prototypes, which it will start testing in a few months. The company started developing its self-driving cars in 2005, and is testing previous models across the U.S. They are expected to be available to buy by 2020.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/us/snowy-owls-released-massachusetts/index.html	us	Snowy owls injured by jet downdrafts are back in the wild - CNN.com	2014/05/27	Tuesday May 27 05:14:42 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Two snowy owls injured by the downdraft of jets taking off in Boston have been released in a safer place where the likes of saltmarsh sparrows and piping plovers flutter amid marshes, bogs and beach dunes. The pair were released Monday morning at Parker River National Wildlife Refuge on Plum Island in northeastern Massachusetts, after nearly eight weeks of treatment and rehabilitation, said Dr. Flo Tseng, director of the wildlife clinic where the birds were treated. The yellow-eyed, white birds were taken in March to the Tufts Wildlife Clinic in North Grafton, where one was treated for soft-tissue wounds and the other had lifesaving surgery for a broken wing, said Tseng. The owls were rescued by Norman Smith, director of the Massachusetts Audubon Society's Blue Hills Trailside Museum, after they were injured at Boston Logan International Airport. The owls have been a concern for decades at the airport, where authorities use nets to catch the birds before relocating them, Smith told CNN in December. A greater number of owls have been reported at the airport this year, Tseng said. Logan officials have captured and released more than 100 snowy owls this winter, as opposed to just 10 owls last year, she said. The influx is possibly due to an abundance of prey. Logan Airport's likeness to the tundra makes it a favorable place for the birds to land, but a dangerous place to fly, Tseng said. Tufts Wildlife Clinic, part of the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University, has treated six snowy owls this year. The clinic has a 100-foot flight pen that's used for conditioning, a key part in the owl's recovery, she said. "We go in there and we bug them. We walk down to the end where they're perched and they'll fly down to the other end. So we end up exercising them," Tseng said. Although snowy owls are not an endangered species, their numbers are declining and nobody knows the actual population of these birds, said Smith. Tseng said the rise and fall in the number of owls they treat each year varies. "We try not to get attached because they're wild animals and many wild animals don't make it. It's really hard for them in captivity," she said.

David Knipes said Sunday. The deadly incident occurred at the beachfront Bermuda Sands motel, where three men were killed and one person was wounded. Knipes said no one has been arrested. A witness told CNN affiliate WPDE that one of the victims ran after the shooting but eventually collapsed. "It was like to the point where he had a lot of blood everywhere and he was just trying to breathe" and he died, Jamont Samuel told the station. At the time of the shooting, people lined the sidewalks of Ocean Boulevard, which was jammed with Memorial Day vacationers and people who came to the area for Atlantic Beach BikeFest. "I was scared to death. I just took off and started running. I was scared," Debra Lovack told WPDE. In one of the other nearby incidents, a woman was shot in the chin and a man in the shoulder. There were four other shootings where two people were wounded, police said. Knipes said police don't believe the shootings are connected. Shooting rampage in California kills 6  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/23/justice/connecticut-religious-cult-lawsuit/index.html	crime	Connecticut lawsuit claims teachers indoctrinated teens into cult - CNN.com	2014/05/23	Friday May 23 05:10:08 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- A Connecticut family has filed a lawsuit claiming a public school district, a trio of high school teachers and others engaged in a "predatory religious indoctrination" that left their daughters speaking a "bizarre new language." The 64-page federal lawsuit, which does not name the young women or their parents, claims three sisters attending Avon High School were targeted and indoctrinated without the knowledge or consent of their parents. Two of the girls, now 22 and 19 years old, experienced sudden and severe personality changes, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday. "They lost their humor and their empathy," the family claims in court documents. "They began speaking in a bizarre new language." The alleged religious cult promoted martyrdom and celebrated death, causing the eldest sisters to "experience fantasies of suicidal ideation and martyrdom," according to the lawsuit. The youngest daughter, who is 16, also was allegedly targeted by the cult but "eventually broke free." The documents name three teachers and a guidance counselor as "predators" acting on behalf of the cult but also seeks to hold Avon Public Schools accountable for allegedly failing to properly supervise and control its employees. One defendant declined comment while another did not return calls. Two others could not be reached. Avon Public Schools said: "The district administration is in receipt of the complaint filed recently in federal court and is reviewing it at this time. No communications regarding that which is alleged in the complaint have been received in the past. We will continue to review the content of the complaint and have turned the matter over to our school district legal counsel." Wellesley College is also named as a defendant for its alleged role in allowing the teachers and guidance counselor to maintain contact with the girls after high school. The college said it was preparing a statement. The lawsuit claims the girls "would frequently go to Alumni Hall, where it was desolate and they would dance, sing and perform 'whirling dervishes' -- religious dances -- until the wee hours of the morning." The eldest daughters have cut off communication with the rest of their family as well as their friends, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and changes in school policy.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/politics/white-house-cia-outing/index.html	politics	Accidental outing of CIA official could end a covert career - CNN.com	2014/05/27	Tuesday May 27 12:38:39 EDT 2014	Given the potentially dangerous nature of the situation, CNN has not broadcast or published online the name of the official. Administration officials expressed alarm over the mistake. Deputy National Security Adviser Antony Blinken told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that steps are being taken. "It shouldn't have happened. We're trying to figure out why it happened. In fact, chief of staff Denis McDonough asked the White House counsel to look into it, to figure out what happened and to make sure it won't happen again," Blinken said. Asked whether the official will have to leave Afghanistan, Blinken added, "You'll understand that I can't comment on the details, but you can rest assured that the security of this person is foremost in our minds and will be taken care of." The official's name was included on a list of people attending a military briefing for President Barack Obama during his surprise visit to Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan on Sunday. It's common for such lists to be given to the media, but names of intelligence officials are rarely provided. In this case, the individual's name was listed next to the title, "Chief of Station." The common practice is for the print pool reporter -- a journalist representing the wider media contingent who relays information about an event to other reporters -- to copy and paste the list provided by the White House into what is called a media pool report. It then gets distributed to a large list of media outlets by the White House, which does not edit the list. In this case, the print pool reporter that day -- Scott Wilson, the White House bureau chief for the Washington Post -- noticed the unusual entry after the White House distributed the list. Wilson checked it out with officials, and the White House later distributed a shorter list from a different reporter that did not include the station chief's name. In his account to CNN, Wilson said that when the media pool accompanying Obama arrived in Afghanistan, he asked White House officials for a list of who would be briefing the President. A White House official then asked the military for a list to provide to the pool of journalists. The official got an e-mail back from the military with a subject line, "manifest for briefing for pool," Wilson told CNN. That e-mail was forwarded to Wilson, and he proceeded to copy and paste it for the pool report. Wilson then sent it to the White House official, who sent the report to the distribution list that reaches some 6,000 journalists. After the initial report was issued, Wilson noticed that the chief of station had been identified in the list. He flagged the White House official, who checked with the military and then said: "This is a problem." The White House official asked if Wilson would write another pool report that would advise journalists to disregard the previous report, which contained the chief of station's name. Wilson said he was open to the request and sent the White House a new report, but he was unsure if it got distributed. According to Wilson, another pool report from a different reporter that was distributed later included details from Obama's speech to the troops, as well as the shorter list of names that excluded the CIA official and a note saying, "This is the correct list of participants." Rep. Peter King, R-New York, called the accidental outing "unpardonable." "This is something that they had a chance to look at and look at again, and they still allowed it to be out," he told CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront" Tuesday night. "To me, it's unforgivable and the message has to be sent that this type of incompetence -- six years into an administration -- is just inexcusable." A station chief heads the CIA's office in a foreign country, establishing a relationship with its host intelligence service and overseeing agency activities. The identity of station chiefs, like most CIA officers, are rarely disclosed to protect them and their ability to operate secretly. In the most recent case of a spy being outed, the Bush administration infamously leaked the name of former CIA officer Valerie Plame to a journalist in 2003. Plame, who resigned from the CIA after the incident, tweeted on Monday that the White House's mistake this past weekend was "astonishing." No one was punished for leaking Plame's CIA role to the media. Scooter Libby, the chief of staff to then-Vice President Dick Cheney, was convicted of perjury, obstruction and lying to the FBI about the Plame leak. President George W. Bush later commuted Libby's 30-month prison sentence. Top U.S. spy pulled from Pakistan after terror threats CNN's Jim Acosta, Ashley Killough and Matt Hoye contributed to this report. 
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/23/politics/julian-castro-profile/index.html	politics	Julian Castro's rapid rise no surprise to Texas pals - CNN.com	2014/05/23	Friday May 23 03:55:07 EDT 2014	Washington (CNN) -- Julian Castro, the mayor of San Antonio, and Mike Villarreal, the city's representative in the state legislature, saw potential in an historic, amoeba-shaped park parcel near the city's convention center. So, the two set to work. They secured the civic support, government approval and funding needed to turn HemisFair Park into a place where playgrounds and mixed income housing will one day overlook a grassy span and the Tower of the Americas  an observation tower marking the park's location as the site of the 1968 World's Fair. As President Barack Obama's choice to become the next housing secretary, a focus on helping revitalize inner-city areas, colleagues in Texas say, will stand the 39-year-old mayor in good stead. "Based on his focus here in San Antonio on working to improve housing in the city's core and inner city, I suspect he would advance an agenda that has in mind family and children," said Villarreal, who is vying to replace Castro as mayor. "I think you're going to be seeing a secretary of housing who understands housing on a human level." Obama 's new pick for HUD secretary If confirmed, Castro would head an agency that is still reeling from fallout from the housing crisis  including meeting mushrooming demands for affordable rental housing. He will also be tasked with helping the financially beleaguered Federal Housing Administration, which has been struggling to cope with a record number of home mortgage defaults. Obama noted during the nomination ceremony that Castro "never forgets where he comes from." He also highlighted Castro's mention of his Mexican-born grandmother in his keynote address to the Democratic convention in 2012 as an immigrant who worked hard to provide a home for her family. "For her and generations like her a home is more than just a house," Obama said. Castro will likely face questions in his confirmation hearings why San Antonio did not follow federal guidelines when it spent millions in HUD funds aimed at helping address the housing crisis during his tenure as mayor, according to a 2012 report by the agency's inspector general. The report found the city did not use a competitive bid process when it awarded $2.5 million for renovation contracts and that it did not follow federal affordability guidelines designed to target lower income residents when it spent just over $1 million to buy and fix up homes. A call to Castro's San Antonio office seeking comment about his HUD nomination was not immediately returned. Still, supporters feel Castro has the right mix of experience to lead the agency. "This economy has not been as robust as we would have hoped," Henry Cisneros, a former HUD secretary and former San Antonio mayor told CNN on Friday. "Part of the reason for that has been because the housing sector has been on the sidelines. But now housing can get into the fray and, as HUD secretary, Castro is well-poised to do that." Cisneros, who says he has discussed housing-related issues with Castro in the past and plans on having additional conversations with him, said that as mayor of San Antonio, the younger man dealt with issues of poverty, homelessness and home affordability and is well suited to the task. Opinion: Why Julian Castro said yes to Obama Texas political consultant Bill Miller also feels Castro is up to the challenge. "He'll be a cool customer. He's not going to get supercharged or over wrought over anything," said Miller who is a founding partner at HillCo Partners in Austin, a state political consulting group. "If there have been problems and challenges at the agency he's not going to be let's throw the baby out with the bathwater." Castro's appointment also would be a win for Democrats looking to add diversity to its national roster of potential candidates and put Texas in play in 2016 as well as help smooth over tensions with Latinos who are frustrated over a lack of an immigration reform overhaul, said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University historian and CNN contributor. "In terms of the Democrats and Obama, it is at least symbolic of the party's commitment to immigration and immigration reform," Zelizer said. "It does elevate his status. It makes him a national figure rather than a local figure." Castro, the son of political activists, is the youngest mayor of a major American city. His meteoric rise from local government to being called upon to take on a Cabinet-level position is a political narrative tailor-made for primetime. He and his twin brother, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, were picked to take the stage at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte. The congressman introduced his brother who in turn gave a keynote address that was memorable for both his young daughter's charming hair flip and his tale of a second-generation, Mexican-American immigrant's successful rise. "My grandmother never owned a house. She cleaned other people's houses so she could afford to rent her own. But she saw her daughter become the first in her family to graduate from college," he said during the 2012 address. "And my mother fought hard for civil rights so that instead of a mop, I could hold this microphone." Mayors' stories out of school Beyond the immigrant son-made-good narrative, Castro brings a "new energy" to the President's second term, said Trey Martinez Fischer, a Democratic Texas state representative who heads that body's Mexican American Legislative Caucus. "It's very important to note is that he brings a fresh perspective and new energy to this President's second term, Fischer said. "He could serve as a pick me up for an administration that's been in place for some time."  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/26/politics/hensarling-boehner-conservatives-alternative/index.html	politics	Conservatives float alternative to Boehner - CNN.com	2014/05/26	Monday May 26 10:32:02 EDT 2014	Washington (CNN) -- Some conservatives unhappy with House Speaker John Boehner's leadership are looking for a replacement, and recent moves by Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling are fueling speculation he wants Boehner's job in the next Congress. Hensarling, who was part of Boehner's leadership team two years ago but left to chair the House Financial Services Committee, gave an expansive speech last week hosted by Heritage Action for America, a group that frequently and publicly clashes with Boehner. Asked afterward if he was interested in running for speaker, Hensarling initially said he was "flattered," and said, "It's not something I've aspired to. It's not something I'm thinking about." But then he left the door open, saying, "No, I haven't been Shermanesque, again I'm not sure there's any opportunity I want to foreclose." While Heritage Action's Chief Executive Officer Michael Needham told CNN that his group doesn't get involved in leadership races, the conservative group gave Hensarling a high-profile platform to outline his own conservative philosophy for governing. Needham said there is a "real need to take on sacred cows in Washington at time when the party too often looks after K Street," a reference to the downtown D.C. address for corporate lobbyists. He said, "Jeb Hensarling is a great spokesman and fighter for conservative values." Boehner has said he's staying put Boehner, in his 12th term in Congress and in his second as speaker, continues to insist he's not going anywhere and expects to remain in charge next year. But he raised questions earlier this month when he wouldn't commit to serving out another full term as speaker. At the beginning of the current Congress in January 2013, a dozen House GOP members voted for someone other than Boehner, or voted "present," an expression of no confidence. Many in that small group are convinced Boehner won't run for his post after this year's midterms or that he won't have the votes to keep that title. If Boehner decides to step down from the position, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor is popular among conservatives, and most expect him to move up and take the speaker's gavel. In that scenario conservatives could wage an effort to fill in top House GOP posts. Boehner on the establishment and the tea party Multiple House Republicans -- some who voted for Boehner in 2013 and some who didn't -- praised Hensarling as a solid conservative, but also told CNN there's a short list of others who are viable candidates. Many House Republicans interviewed by CNN declined to talk openly about potential leadership challenges, but admitted there are informal discussions about options. The names repeatedly raised include Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, who like Hensarling is a former chairman of the fiscally conservative Republican Study Committee; Louisiana Republican Rep. Steve Scalise, who currently heads that group; and Georgia Rep. Tom Price, another former study group leader who also served in Boehner's leadership team in the last Congress. "The one consensus point is that we'd like to see more conservatives in future leadership posts," Louisiana Republican John Fleming told CNN. But he cautioned for now there's no single alternative emerging to Boehner -- or anyone who might want to challenge the speaker's current top lieutenants -- Cantor and GOP Whip Kevin McCarthy. He said he expected more serious discussions to ramp up by the end of the summer. Hensarling's recent speech at Heritage may be a way to ensure his name gets in the mix. The Texas Republican used the speech to position himself firmly on the right. He called out his own party for breaking with its free market roots, arguing that the party should be shifting away from policies designed to help big business and the well-connected and instead champion policies to help the "Main Street competitive economy." The thrust of Hensarling's speech lines up with the message many on the right flank of the House GOP conference have been pushing. Idaho Republican Raul Labrador has publicly criticized House GOP leaders for pushing a legislative agenda that positions the GOP as the "party of big business" and doesn't resonate with small businesses and entrepreneurs. Challenging the party Hensarling argued those on Main Street are "not looking for a subsidy, earmark, tax preference or legislated advantage." On a series of issues -- tax reform, farm policy, reform of mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae -- Hensarling challenged his party to hold votes on legislation that would restructure current federal systems. The bulk of Hensarling's ire was directed at the Export Import Bank, the 80-year-old credit agency that gives out loans to companies to promote U.S. exports. The bank's lending authority is due to expire at the end of the year. Hensarling defended 2013 GOP shutdown strategy Hensarling held it up as the poster child of corporate welfare, citing that the vast majority of its taxpayer backed loans go to companies like aircraft manufacturing giant Boeing. He said getting rid of the bank "is a defining issue for our party and our movement." If Hensarling or anyone else is serious about mounting a challenge, the Republicans that CNN interviewed all agree that if they are serious they need to move soon. "It seems to me that the odds of there being some type of change within the leadership team seem to be more likely than less, and so as long as there are members talking about it it's better to do so early than late," Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King told CNN. North Carolina Republican Rep. Walter Jones, who opposed Boehner in the last election, told CNN that he hears from Republicans in his district that it's time for a leadership change in Washington. "There is a great deal of frustration," Jones said. He wasn't sure if Hensarling or someone else was the right fit, but said a successful campaign required several months or preparation. A few months ago unhappiness about Boehner's handling of government spending fights and concern he would negotiate with Democrats on a major immigration bill roiled the conference. But because members aren't coalescing around a single alternative, the vacuum gives Boehner some job security for now. Fleming said tension is down between conservatives and Boehner because the speaker agreed to form a select committee on the deadly Benghazi terror attack and hold a House vote that held former IRS official Lois Lerner in contempt for the controversy around her agency's targeting of conservative groups. He said "there are less things that divide us -- but the one question would be immigration."  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/23/politics/benghazi-kerry-testify/index.html	politics	Kerry agrees to testify on Benghazi attack - CNN.com	2014/05/23	Friday May 23 01:14:09 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Secretary of State John Kerry has agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee on the deadly Benghazi terror attack, according to a letter from his office to the panel that was obtained by CNN. Kerry was subpoenaed by Oversight panel Chairman Darrell Issa of California after new emails surfaced that Republicans say support their contention the Obama administration politicized its public response to the September 2012 assault. The attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in eastern Libya killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. It's not clear whether the recent formation of a House Select Committee to investigate Benghazi will impact the Oversight probe. The Republican-led Select Committee is still organizing and hasn't scheduled any hearings. According to the letter to Issa that was copied to top members of the Select Committee as well, the State Department said Kerry could not accommodate the Oversight panel's demand that he appear on May 29 due to scheduling conflicts. However, the letter said Kerry was "prepared to appear" at a later hearing, which the panel has now set for June 12. "The committee looks forward to his appearance," Frederick Hill, a spokesman for the panel, said in a statement. Additionally, the State Department believes that an appearance before Issa's committee next month would "remove any need" for him to testify before the Select Committee to "answer additional questions."

Obama, who has carefully avoided mentioning any sort of military confrontation in his responses to the challenges in Syria and Ukraine, hit back at his critics, saying his goal is to avoid costly "errors" on the world stage. But the world waits for no man. Obama may advocate a risk-averse foreign policy, but he has a series of pressing global challenges which are likely to dominate the remainder of his term. Here are a few: Russia The political crisis in Ukraine and President Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea have led to tensions between the United States and Russia that are reminiscent of the Cold War. Those tensions quickly have become the Obama administration's central foreign policy crisis and have tested Washington's mettle and its alliance with Europe. The United States and its allies have accused Moscow of backing militant separatists and fomenting ethnic skirmishes in eastern Ukraine, and while praising Ukraine's elections this weekend, have charged Russia with attempting to disrupt the vote. Russia has been kicked out of the G8 group of industrialized countries, and the United States and the European Union have slapped a series of sanctions on Russian officials and entities. But a military response has been all but ruled out and there seems to be little if any taste on either side of the Atlantic for the kind of sectoral sanctions which would deter Putin. The United States says Russia is feeling the economic heat from the sanctions, but this month in Shanghai, Putin signed a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping to provide China with $400 billion worth of natural gas from Siberia over the next 30 years. Moreover, Russia has proven it can impose costs of its own. Although Washington and Moscow teamed up on a deal to rid Syria of its chemical weapons, Russia's political and military support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and its pledge to provide weapons to governments across the Mideast continue to frustrate the United States. With a veto-wielding permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, Russia is able to block action on world crises. The U.S. needs to work with Russia on a nuclear deal with Iran and on curbing North Korea's own nuclear ambitions. In today's world, a new Cold War simply seems impractical. Syria Three years into Syria's bloody civil war, the opposition remains weak and fragmented, extremists continue to grow in numbers and influence and al-Assad remains firmly in power. A year-long effort to bring the opposition and the regime to the table for peace talks was a failure, and a political negotiation seems further away than ever while the humanitarian catastrophe continues to grow. Despite the U.S.-Russia agreement to remove Syria's chemical weapons, the regime is believed to have launched chlorine attacks which are now being investigated by U.N. inspectors. The administration talks of needing to change al-Assad's "calculus," but Obama has resisted pressure from many of his top advisers to involve the United States deeper in the conflict. Without a decisive change in the balance of power on the military field, it seems unlikely al-Assad will feel compelled to make a deal. Iran World powers are just under two months away from a July 20 deadline for a comprehensive deal with Iran on its nuclear program. An interim pact reached with Tehran in November eased some economic sanctions in return for Iran rolling back parts of its nuclear program, which the United States and others believe is designed to produce a weapon. Iran says its nuclear intentions are peaceful. U.S. negotiators say progress has been made in several rounds of negotiations and the so-called P5+1 -- the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany -- and Iran have begun to draft an agreement. But a number of significant roadblocks remain, including the future of Iran's heavy water reactor in Arak, its underground facility at Fordo and whether Iran will maintain the right to enrich a small amount of low-grade uranium on its own soil for medical and research purposes. Iran has said those are all sticking points, but Israel and the United States aren't likely to budge on them. A recent U.N. report also warned that Iran continues to pursue ballistic missile capability and Tehran appears unwilling to discuss its missile technology as part of the nuclear negotiations, to the great frustration of the U.S. and its European allies. New concerns have also surfaced over reports that Russia and Iran are discussing an oil-for-goods deal, which could violate the terms of the interim agreement, circumvent sanctions and derail the fate of the talks. Terror threat The United States got Osama bin Laden and diminished the capacity of al Qaeda's senior leadership in Pakistan, but a recent State Department report said the terror group's affiliate organizations have gotten even deadlier. And a series of al Qaeda-based threats to attack American and Western targets in Europe is causing major concern inside the U.S. intelligence community. The State Department report said the group's affiliate in Yemen -- al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- is among the most lethal of the network and "continues to pose the most significant threat to the United States," which shut down its Embassy in Yemen due to the threats. The civil war in Syria has created conditions allowing parts of the country to become a new haven for al Qaeda-linked groups and thousands of foreign fighters -- a situation that U.S. officials warn could come back to threaten the U.S. homeland. Next door in Iraq, a weak security environment in the western section of the country, along with the destabilizing effects of the situation in Syria, have allowed a former al Qaeda affiliate, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, to move across the border with ease to conduct its own attacks. Terrorist groups across North and West Africa are posing an ever-greater threat -- from Mali and Libya, where al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and other extremists groups are growing in strength -- to Kenya, where militants from al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked group in Somalia, are blamed for an increasing number of attacks. The recent kidnapping of hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls by Boko Haram has suddenly raised the profile of this al Qaeda-linked group. While al Qaeda's affiliates are grabbing the headlines, the body's core group in Pakistan may be making a comeback. Officials tell CNN's Barbara Starr the core is seeking to place operatives to attack U.S. targets at home and abroad. Asia The more pressing crises in Ukraine and Syria have prevented the Obama administration from focusing on the long anticipated "pivot to Asia," billed as an effort to cement American presence in the region and counter China's rise. However, the region is experiencing significant chaos, and managing China has proven a formidable challenge. Tensions continue to escalate between Japan and China over a set of deserted islands in the East China Sea. Beijing is also stepping up its territorial claims in the South China Sea, and this week a Chinese vessel rammed and sank a Vietnamese fishing boat after a series of anti-Chinese riots that left four Chinese workers dead and more than 100 injured. The two closest U.S. allies in the region -- Japan and South Korea -- are feuding over what Seoul perceives as inadequate remorse from its brutal colonization and the use of Korean "comfort women" during World War II. Elsewhere in the region, Thailand's military seized power in a bloodless coup. And Washington's ambitions at increasing trade in the region appear stalled. Obama traveled to Japan last month to forge a deal with Japan to move ahead with the 12-nation free-trade Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) but left Tokyo empty-handed. The turmoil is distracting from the region's most dangerous threat -- unpredictable North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his nuclear arsenal. Kim's erratic behavior and threats of a fourth nuclear test have prompted the United States and Korea to shelve the scheduled transfer of wartime operational control of troops on the Korean peninsula from Washington to Seoul. And more ... Plenty of other challenges remain: from managing relations with Egypt after the near-certain election of former defense minister Abdel Fattah al-Sissi -- whose interim government has been accused of widespread human rights abuses -- to salvaging the Mideast peace process, after talks broke down last month. As Obama winds down the war in Afghanistan, violence is surging in Iraq, the first war he brought to a close -- a potent reminder the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan must be managed carefully. And as the President seeks to articulate a foreign policy that avoids aggressive military entanglements while countering critics calling for a more aggressive U.S. foreign policy, it remains certain that his inbox will remain full.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/politics/obama-west-point-foreign-policy-transcript/index.html	politics	President Obama's remarks at West Point - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 11:59:44 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you, General Caslen, for that introduction. To General Trainor and General Clarke, the faculty and staff at West Point, you have been outstanding stewards of this proud institution and outstanding mentors for the newest officers in the United States Army. I'd like to acknowledge the Army's leadership, General McHugh -- Secretary McHugh, General Odierno, as well as Senator Jack Reed who is here and a proud graduate of West Point himself. To the class of 2014, I congratulate you on taking your place on the Long Gray Line. Among you is the first all-female command team: Erin Mauldin and Austen Boroff. In Calla Glavin, you have a Rhodes Scholar, and Josh Herbeck proves that West Point accuracy extends beyond the three-point line. To the entire class, let me reassure you in these final hours at West Point, as commander in chief, I hereby absolve all cadets who are on restriction for minor conduct offenses. Let me just add that nobody ever did that for me when I was in school. I know you join me in extending a word of thanks to your families. Joe DeMoss, whose son James is graduating, spoke for a whole lot of parents when he wrote me a letter about the sacrifices you've made. "Deep inside," he wrote, "we want to explode with pride at what they are committing to do in the service of our country." Like several graduates, James is a combat veteran. And I would ask all of us here today to stand and pay tribute, not only to the veterans among us, but to the more than 2.5 million Americans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as their families. This is a particularly useful time for America to reflect on those who've sacrificed so much for our freedom. A few days after Memorial Day. You are the first class to graduate since 9/11 who may not be sent into combat in Iraq or Afghanistan. When I first spoke at West Point in 2009, we still had more than 100,000 troops in Iraq. We were preparing to surge in Afghanistan. Our counterterrorism efforts were focused on Al Qaeda's core leadership, those who had carried out the 9/11 attacks. And our nation was just beginning a long climb out of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Four and a half years later, as you graduate, the landscape has changed. We have removed our troops from Iraq. We are winding down our war in Afghanistan. Al Qaeda's leadership on the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan has been decimated, and Osama bin Laden is no more. And, through it all, we have refocused our investments in what has always been a key source of American strength, a growing economy that can provide opportunity for everybody who's willing to work hard and take responsibility here at home. In fact, by most measures, America has rarely been stronger relative to the rest of the world. Those who argue otherwise, who suggest that America is in decline or has seen its global leadership slip away, are either misreading history or engaged in partisan politics. Think about it. Our military has no peer. The odds of a direct threat against us by any nation are low, and do not come close to the dangers we faced during the Cold War. Meanwhile, our economy remains the most dynamic on Earth; our businesses the most innovative. Each year, we grow more energy independent. From Europe to Asia, we are the hub of alliances unrivaled in the history of nations. America continues to attract striving immigrants. The values of our founding inspire leaders in parliaments and new movements in public squares around the globe. And when a typhoon hits the Philippines, or schoolgirls are kidnapped in Nigeria, or masked men occupy a building in Ukraine -- it is America that the world looks to for help. So the United States is and remains the one indispensable nation. It has been true for the century passed, and will likely be true for the century to come. But the world is changing with accelerating speed. This presents opportunity, but also new dangers. We know all too well, after 9/11, just how technology and globalization has put power once reserved for states in the hands of the individuals, raising the capacity of terrorists to do harm. Russia's aggression towards former Soviet states unnerves capitals in Europe, while China's economic rise and military reach worries its neighbors. From Brazil to India, rising middle classes compete with us, and governments seek a greater say in global forums. And even as developing nations embrace democracy and market economies, 24 hour news and social media makes it impossible to ignore the continuation of sectarian conflicts and failing states and popular uprisings that might have received only passing notice a generation ago. It will be your generation's task to respond to this new world. The question we face, the question each of you will face is not whether America will lead, but how we will lead, not just to secure our peace and prosperity, but also extend peace and prosperity around the globe. Now, this question isn't new. At least since George Washington served as commander-in-chief, there have been those who warned against foreign entanglements that do not touch directly on our security or economic well being. Today, according to self-described realists, conflicts in Syria or Ukraine or the Central African Republic are not ours to solve. And not surprisingly, after costly wars and continuing challenges here at home, that view is shared by many Americans. A different view from interventionists from the left and the right says that we ignore these conflicts at our own peril, that America's willingness to apply force around the world is the ultimate safeguard against chaos, and America's failure to act in the face of Syrian brutality or Russian provocations not only violates our conscience, but invites escalating aggression in the future. And each side can point to history to support its claims. But I believe neither view fully speaks to the demands of this moment. It is absolutely true that in the 21st century, American isolationism is not an option. We don't have a choice to ignore what happens beyond our borders. If nuclear materials are not secure, that poses a danger to American citizens. As the Syrian civil war spills across borders, the capacity of battle-hardened extremist groups to come after us only increases. Regional aggression that goes unchecked, whether in southern Ukraine or the South China Sea, or anywhere else in the world, will ultimately impact our allies and could draw in our military. We can't ignore what happens beyond our boundaries. And beyond these narrow rationales, I believe we have a real stake, abiding self-interest, in making sure our children and our grandchildren grow up in a world where school girls are not kidnapped, and where individuals are not slaughtered because of tribe or faith or political belief. I believe that a world of greater freedom and tolerance is not only a moral imperative, it also helps keep us safe. But to say that we have an interest in pursuing peace and freedom beyond our borders is not to say that every problem has a military solution. Since World War II, some of our most costly mistakes came not from our restraint, but from our willingness to rush into military adventures -- without thinking through the consequences; without building international support and legitimacy for our action; without leveling with the American people about the sacrifice required. Tough talk often draws headlines, but war rarely conforms to slogans. As General Eisenhower, someone with hard-earned knowledge on this subject, said at this ceremony in 1947: "War is mankind's most tragic and stupid folly; to seek or advise its deliberate provocation is a black crime against all men." Like Eisenhower, this generation of men and women in uniform know all too well the wages of war. And that includes those of you here at West Point. Four of the servicemembers who stood in the audience when I announced the surge of our forces in Afghanistan gave their lives in that effort. A lot more were wounded. I believe America's security demanded those deployments. But I am haunted by those deaths. I am haunted by those wounds. And I would betray my duty to you, and to the country we love, if I ever sent you into harm's way simply because I saw a problem somewhere in the world that needed to be fixed, or because I was worried about critics who think military intervention is the only way for America to avoid looking weak. Here's my bottom line: America must always lead on the world stage. If we don't, no one else will. The military that you have joined is, and always will be, the backbone of that leadership. But U.S. military action cannot be the only -- or even primary -- component of our leadership in every instance. Just because we have the best hammer does not mean that every problem is a nail. And because the costs associated with military action are so high, you should expect every civilian leader -- and especially your commander in chief -- to be clear about how that awesome power should be used. So, let me spend the rest of my time describing my vision for how the United States of America, and our military, should lead in the years to come, for you will be part of that leadership. First, let me repeat a principle I put forward at the outset of my presidency: the United States will use military force, unilaterally if necessary, when our core interests demand it, when our people are threatened, when our livelihoods are at stake, when the security of our allies is in danger. In these circumstances, we still need to ask tough questions about whether our actions are proportional and effective and just. International opinion matters, but America should never ask permission to protect our people, our homeland or our way of life. On the other hand, when issues of global concern do not pose a direct threat to the United States, when such issues are at stake, when crises arrive that stir our conscience or push the world in a more dangerous direction, but do not directly threaten us, then the threshold for military action must be higher. In such circumstances, we should not go it alone. Instead, we must mobilize allies and partners to take collective action. We have to broaden our tools to include diplomacy and development, sanctions and isolation, appeals to international law, and if just, necessary and effective, multilateral military action. In such circumstances, we have to work with others because collective action in these circumstances is more likely to succeed, more likely to be sustained, less likely to lead to costly mistakes. This leads to my second point. For the foreseeable future, the most direct threat to America at home and abroad remains terrorism. But a strategy that involves invading every country that harbors terrorist networks is naive and unsustainable. I believe we must shift our counterterrorism strategy, drawing on the successes and shortcomings of our experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, to more effectively partner with countries where terrorist networks seek a foothold. And the need for a new strategy reflects the fact that today's principal threat no longer comes from a centralized Al Qaida leadership. Instead, it comes from decentralized Al Qaida affiliates and extremists, many with agendas focused in countries where they operate. And this lessens the possibility of large-scale 9/11-style attacks against the homeland, but it heightens the danger of U.S. personnel overseas being attacked, as we saw in Benghazi. It heightens the danger to less defensible targets, as we saw in a shopping mall in Nairobi. So we have to develop a strategy that matches this diffuse threat, one that expands our reach without sending forces that stretch our military too thin or stir up local resentments. We need partners to fight terrorists along-side us. And empowering partners is a large part of what we have done and what we are currently doing in Afghanistan. Together with our allies, America struck huge blows against Al Qaida core and pushed back against an insurgency that threatened to overrun the country. But sustaining this progress depends on the ability of Afghans to do the job. And that's why we trained hundreds of thousands of Afghan soldiers and police. Earlier this spring, those forces, those Afghan forces, secured an election in which Afghans voted for the first democratic transfer of power in their history. And at the end of this year, a new Afghan President will be in office, and America's combat mission will be over. Now, that was an enormous achievement made because of America's armed forces. But as we move to a train and advise mission in Afghanistan, our reduced presence there allows us to more effectively address emerging threats in the Middle East and North Africa. So earlier this year, I asked my national security team to develop a plan for a network of partnerships from South Asia to the Sahel. Today, as part of this effort, I am calling on Congress to support a new Counter-Terrorism Partnerships Fund of up to $5 billion, which will allow us to train, build capacity, and facilitate partner countries on the front lines. And these resources will give us flexibility to fulfill different missions, including training security forces in Yemen who have gone on the offensive against al Qaida; supporting a multinational force to keep the peace in Somalia; working with European allies to train a functioning security force and border patrol in Libya; and facilitating French operations in Mali. A critical focus of this effort will be the ongoing crisis in Syria. As frustrating as it is, there are no easy answers there. No military solution that can eliminate the terrible suffering any time soon. As president, I made a decision that we should not put American troops into the middle of this increasingly sectarian war, and I believe that is the right decision. But that does not mean we shouldn't help the Syrian people stand up against a dictator who bombs and starves his own people. And in helping those who fight for the right of all Syrians to choose their own future, we are also pushing back against the growing number of extremists who find safe haven in the chaos. So with the additional resources I'm announcing today, we will step up our efforts to support Syria's neighbors: Jordan and Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq, as they contend with refugees and confront terrorists working across Syria's borders. I will work with Congress to ramp up support for those in the Syrian opposition who offer the best alternative to terrorists and brutal dictators. And we will continue to coordinate with our friends in Europe and the Arab world to push for a political resolution of this crisis, and to make sure that those countries and not just the United States are contributing their fair share to support the Syrian people. Let me make one final point about our efforts against terrorism. The partnerships I described do not eliminate the need to take direct action, when necessary, to protect ourselves. When we have actionable intelligence, that's what we do. Through capture operations, like the one that brought a terrorist involved in the plot to bomb our embassies in 1998 to face justice, or drone strikes, like those we've carried out in Yemen and Somalia. There are times when those actions are necessary, and we cannot hesitate to protect our people, but as I said last year, in taking direct action, we must uphold standards that reflect our values. That means taking strikes only when we face a continuing, imminent threat, and only where there is no certainty -- where there is near certainty of no civilian casualties. For our actions should meet a simple test: we must not create more enemies than we take off the battlefield. I also believe we must be more transparent about both the basis of our counter-terrorism actions and the manner in which they are carried out. We have to be able to explain them publicly, whether it is drone strikes or trading partners. I will increasingly turn to our military to take the lead and provide information to the public about our efforts. Our intelligence community has done outstanding work, and we have to continue to protect sources and methods, but when we cannot explain our efforts clearly and publicly, we face terrorist propaganda and international suspicion, we erode legitimacy with our partners and our people, and we reduce accountability in our own government. And this issue of transparency is directly relevant to a third aspect of American leadership, and that is our effort to strengthen and enforce international order. After World War II, America had the wisdom to shape institutions to keep the peace and support human progress, from NATO and the United Nations, to the World Bank and IMF. These institutions are not perfect, but they have been a force multiplier. They reduce the need for unilateral American action and increase restraint among other nations. Now, just as the world has changed, this architecture must change as well. At the height of the Cold War, President Kennedy spoke about the need for a peace based upon "a gradual evolution in human institutions." And evolving these international institutions to meet the demands of today must be a critical part of American leadership. Now, there are a lot of folks, a lot of skeptics, who often downplay the effectiveness of multilateral action. For them, working through international institutions, like the U.N., or respecting international law is a sign of weakness. I think they're wrong. Let me offer just two examples why. In Ukraine, Russia's recent actions recall the days when Soviet tanks rolled into Eastern Europe. But this isn't the Cold War. Our ability to shape world opinion helped isolate Russia right away. Because of American leadership, the world immediately condemned the Russian actions. Europe and the G-7 joined us to impose sanctions. NATO reinforced our commitment to Eastern European allies. The IMF is helping to stabilize Ukraine's economy. OSCE monitors brought the eyes of the world to unstable parts of Ukraine. And this mobilization of world opinion and international institutions served as a counterweight to Russian propaganda and Russian troops on the border and armed militias in ski masks. This weekend, Ukrainians voted by the millions. Yesterday, I spoke to their next president. We don't know how the situation will play out, and there will remain grave challenges ahead. But standing with our allies on behalf of international order, working with international institutions, has given a chance for the Ukrainian people to choose their future, without us firing a shot. Similarly, despite frequent warnings from the United States and Israel and others, the Iranian nuclear program steadily advanced for years. At the beginning of my presidency, we built a coalition that imposed sanctions on the Iranian economy, while extending the hand of diplomacy to the Iranian government. And now, we have an opportunity to resolve our differences peacefully. The odds of success are still long, and we reserve all options to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. But for the first time in a decade, we have a very real chance of achieving a breakthrough agreement, one that is more effective and durable than what we could have achieved through the use of force. And throughout these negotiations, it has been our willingness to work through multilateral channels that kept the world on our side. The point is, this is American leadership; this is American strength. In each case, we built coalitions to respond to a specific challenge. Now we need to do more to strengthen the institutions that can anticipate and prevent problems from spreading. For example, NATO is the strongest alliance the world has ever known. But we're now working with NATO allies to meet new missions -- both within Europe, where our Eastern allies must be reassured; and also beyond Europe's borders, where our NATO allies have to pull their weight to counterterrorism and respond to failed states, and train a network of partners. Likewise, the U.N. provides a platform to keep the peace in states torn apart by conflict. Now we need to make sure that those nations who provide peacekeepers have the training and equipment to actually keep the peace, so we can prevent the type of killing we've seen in Congo and Sudan. We are going to deepen our investment in countries that support these missions. Because having other nations maintain order in their own neighborhoods lessens the need for us to put our own troops in harm's way. It's a smart investment. It's the right way to lead. Keep in mind, not all international norms relate directly to armed conflict. We have a serious problem with cyber-attacks, which is why we're working to shape and enforce rules of the road to secure our networks and our citizens. In the Asia Pacific, we're supporting Southeast Asian nations as they negotiate a code of conduct with China on maritime disputes in the South China Sea, and we're working to resolve these disputes through international law. That spirit of cooperation needs to energize the global effort to combat climate change, a creeping national security crisis that will help shape your time in uniform as we are called on to respond to refugee flows and natural disasters and conflicts over water and food. Which is why next year, I intend to make sure America is out front in putting together a global framework to preserve our planet. You see, American influence is always stronger when we lead by example. We can't exempt ourselves from the rules that apply to everybody else. We can't call on others to make commitments to combat climate change if a whole lot of our political leaders deny that it's taking place. We can't try to resolve problems in the South China Sea when we have refused to make sure that the Law of the Sea Convention is ratified by the United States Senate, despite that fact that our top military leaders say the treaty advances our national security. That's not leadership. That's retreat. That's not strength. That's weakness. It would be utterly foreign to leaders like Roosevelt and Truman, Eisenhower and Kennedy. I believe in American exceptionalism with every fiber of my being. But what makes us exceptional is not our ability to flout international norms and the rule of law. It is our willingness to affirm them through our actions. And that's why I will continue to push to close Gitmo, because American values and legal traditions do not permit the indefinite detention of people beyond our borders. That's why we're putting in place new restrictions on how America collects and uses intelligence, because will have fewer partners and be less effective if a perception takes hold that we're conducting surveillance against ordinary citizens. America does not simply stand for stability or the absence of conflict no matter what the cost. We stand for the more lasting peace that can only come through opportunity and freedom for people everywhere. Which brings me to the fourth and final element of American leadership -- our willingness to act on behalf of human dignity. America's support for democracy and human rights goes beyond idealism. It is a matter of national security. Democracies are our closest friends and are far less likely to go to war. Economies based on free and open markets perform better and become markets for our goods. Respect for human rights is an antidote to instability and the grievances that fuel violence and terror. A new century has brought no end to tyranny. In capitals around the globe, including unfortunately some of America's partners, there's been a crackdown on civil society. The cancer of corruption has enriched too many governments and their cronies and enraged citizens from remote villages to iconic squares. And watching these trends, or the violent upheavals in parts of the Arab world, it's easy to be cynical. But remember that because of America's efforts, because of American diplomacy and foreign assistance, as well as the sacrifices of our military, more people live under elected governments today than at any time in human history. Technology is empowering civil society in ways that no iron fist can control. New breakthroughs are lifting of hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, and even the upheaval of the Arab world reflects the rejection of an authoritarian order that was anything but stable, and now offers the long-term prospect of more responsive and effective governance. In countries like Egypt, we acknowledge that our relationship is anchored in security interests, from peace treaties to Israel to shared efforts against violent extremism. So, we have not cut off cooperation with the new government, but we can and will persistently press for reforms that the Egyptian people have demanded. And meanwhile, look at a country like Burma, which only a few years ago was an intractable dictatorship and hostile to the United States. 40 million people. Thanks to the enormous courage of the people in that country, and because we took the diplomatic initiative, American leadership, we have seen political reforms opening a once-closed society. A movement by Burmese leadership away from partnership with North Korea, in favor of engagement with America and our allies. We're now supporting reform and badly needed national reconciliation through assistance and investment, through coaxing and, at times, public criticism. And progress there could be reversed. But if Burma succeeds, we will have gained a new partner without having fired a shot. American leadership. In each these cases, we should not expect change to happen overnight. That's why we form alliances, not just with governments, but also with ordinary people. For, unlike other nations, America is not afraid of individual empowerment. We are strengthened by it. We're strengthened by civil society. We're strengthened by a free press. We're strengthened by striving entrepreneurs and small businesses. We're strengthened by our educational exchange and opportunity for all people, and women and girls. That's who we are. That's what we represent. I saw that through the trip to Africa last year, where American assistance has made possible the prospect of an AIDS-free generation, while helping Africans care themselves for their sick. We're helping farmers get their products to market, to feed populations once endangered by famine. We aim to double access to electricity in sub- Saharan Africa, so people are connected to the promises of the global economy. And all this creates new partners and shrinks the space for terrorism and conflict. Now, tragically, no American security operation can eradicate the threat posed by an extremist group like Boko Haram, the group that kidnapped those girls. And that's why we ought to focus not just on rescuing those girls right away, but also on supporting Nigerian efforts to educate its youth. It should be one of the hard-earned lessons of Iraq and Afghanistan, where our military became the strongest advocate for diplomacy and development. They understood that foreign assistance is not an afterthought -- something nice to do apart from our national defense, apart from our national security. It is part of what makes us strong. Ultimately, global leadership requires us to see the world as it is, with all its danger and uncertainty. We have to be prepared for the worst, prepared for every contingency. But American leadership also requires us to see the world as it should be -- a place where the aspirations of individual human beings really matters; where hopes and not just fears govern; where the truths written into our founding documents can steer the currents of history in a direction of justice. And we cannot do that without you. Class of 2014, you have taken this time to prepare on the quiet banks of the Hudson. You leave this place to carry forward a legacy that no other military in human history can claim. You do so as part of a team that extends beyond your units or even our armed forces, where in the course of your service, you will work as a team with diplomats and development experts. You'll get to know allies and train partners. And you will embody what it means for America to lead the world. Next week, I will go to Normandy, to honor the men who stormed the beaches there. And while it's hard for many Americans to comprehend the courage and sense of duty that guided those who boarded small ships, it's familiar to you. At West Point, you defined what it means to be a patriot. Three years ago, Gavin White graduated from this academy. He then served in Afghanistan. Like the soldiers who came before him, Gavin was in a foreign land, helping people he'd never met, putting himself in harm's way for the sake of his community and his family, of the folks back home. Gavin lost one of his legs in an attack. I met him last year at Walter Reed. He was wounded, but just as determined as the day that he arrived here at West Point, and he developed a simple goal. Today, his sister Morgan will graduate, and true to his promise, Gavin will be there to stand and exchange salutes with her. We have been through a long season of war. We have faced trials that were not foreseen. And we've seen the visions about how to move forward. But there is something in Gavin's character -- there is something in the American character that will always triumph. Leaving here, you carry with you the respect of your fellow citizens. You will represent a nation with history and hope on our side. Your charge now is not only to protect our country, but to do what is right and just. As your commander in chief, I know you will. May God bless you. May God bless our men and women in uniform. And may God bless the United States of America.

"We will bring America's longest war to a responsible end," Obama said in the White House Rose Garden in detailing the strategy to have virtually all U.S. forces out of Afghanistan by the end of 2016 -- shortly before his presidency ends. The announcement offered something to proponents and opponents of a continued U.S. military engagement there after more than 12 years of war -- the longest in American history. Obama called for 9,800 U.S. troops to stay in Afghanistan after the end of 2014, along with some allied forces. The number would get cut roughly in half by the end of 2015, and a year later -- less than a month before Obama leaves the White House -- the U.S. military presence would scale down to what officials described as a "normal" embassy security contingent. A senior administration official told CNN that after 2016, the number of U.S. service members in Afghanistan providing embassy security and engaging in cooperative security efforts with the host government and military would likely number about 1,000. Currently, the United States has 32,000 troops there. Maintaining any forces beyond the end of 2014 -- when Washington and its NATO allies will formally halt combat operations -- depends on Afghanistan signing the security agreement rejected by outgoing President Hamid Karzai, Obama said Tuesday. Two candidates facing each other in next month's run-off election to choose Karzai's successor have indicated they will sign the security pact, Obama said. "It's time to turn the page on more than a decade in which so much of our foreign policy was focused on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq," he declared. Three conservative Republicans who generally oppose any reduction in the U.S. military's global posture criticized Obama's announcement as "a monumental mistake and a triumph of politics over strategy." "The President came into office wanting to end the wars he inherited. But wars do not end just because politicians say so," said a statement by Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Obama, however, said Americans have learned it was harder to end a war than to start one, adding that "we have to recognize Afghanistan will not be a perfect place, and it is not America's responsibility to make it one." The role of U.S. troops in Afghanistan after this year will be aimed at "disrupting threats caused by al Qaeda, supporting Afghan security forces and giving the Afghan people the opportunity to succeed as they stand on their own," he said. Tony Blinken, Obama's deputy national security adviser, told CNN that the United States will spend about $20 billion on the continued military presence in Afghanistan after 2014. Asked if such a cost was worth it, Blinken replied: "We want to complete the job that we started." At the same time, he said "we can't be in an endless war posture." In a call with journalists before Obama's announcement, senior administration officials said the intention was to show continued international support for Afghanistan as it transitions to its new elected government. The successful first round of voting showed Afghanistan forces now were capable of providing security, the officials said. The United States had as many as 100,000 forces in Afghanistan at one point. In all, more than 2,300 American troops have been killed in that war, launched in the weeks after the September 11, 2001, al Qaeda terror attacks on the United States. Obama's announcement came the day before he delivers a foreign policy speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. On Tuesday, he indicated the shift in resources permitted by ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan would allow increase counter-terrorism assets in Africa and elsewhere. Until now, Obama's administration has been reluctant to assign a number to American troop strength in Afghanistan once the combat mission ends. House Republican leaders reacted to Obama's announcement with encouragement for a continuing mission, but skepticism over the rigid time line. "I'm pleased the White House met the military's request for forces in Afghanistan. However, holding this mission to an arbitrary egg-timer doesn't make a lick of sense strategically," said Rep. Howard "Buck" McKeon, the California Republican who chairs the House Armed Services Committee. House Speaker John Boehner, who has pushed for reaching a bilateral security agreement with Afghanistan to keep U.S. troops there, said he welcomed the plans for a continuing mission. "It has been my long-standing position that input from our commanders about the conditions on the ground should dictate troop decisions, and not an arbitrary number from Washington," Boehner added in a statement.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/21/world/africa/nigeria-violence/index.html	world	80 U.S. troops in Chad will aid search for abducted Nigerian girls - CNN.com	2014/05/21	Wednesday May 21 07:04:15 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- The United States deployed 80 members of its armed forces to Chad to help in the search for the kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls, the White House said Wednesday. "These personnel will support the operation of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft for missions over northern Nigeria and the surrounding area," it said in a letter. "The force will remain in Chad until its support in resolving the kidnapping situation is no longer required." President Barack Obama informed the House speaker and the president of the Senate of the move. The forces will be involved in maintaining aircraft and analyzing data, but because they are armed, the President is required by law to inform the speaker of the House, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. "These are not combat infantry troops that we put into Chad," Kirby told CNN's "The Lead with Jake Tapper" on Wednesday. "These are folks that are there to support the reconnaissance mission." Boko Haram abducted more than 200 girls last month from a school in northern Nigeria. Officials have speculated that the militants may have transported them to neighboring Chad or Cameroon, but it's not clear where the girls are or whether they've left Nigeria. So why are troops deploying to Chad? "Just geographically, Chad's a great location to do this from," Kirby said, adding that the United States has a good relationship with its government. Reconnaissance flights will be searching an area roughly the size of West Virginia, he said, that includes parts of Nigeria and other countries. The deployment is not based on any new intelligence leads, a senior administration official said. "The truth is, we don't know exactly where they are," Kirby said. "We still believe that they've broken up into small groups and dispersed." A U.S. Predator drone will now be aiding in the search for the girls, a Pentagon official told CNN. Half of the new group of U.S. troops will be operating the launch and recovery of the unarmed drone on its missions, and half of them will be providing security on the ground in Chad. Nigeria asks U.N. to designate Boko Haram as terrorist group Also Wednesday, Nigeria asked the United Nations to designate Boko Haram as a terrorist organization as its escalating attacks spread alarm nationwide. If approved, it will enable countries to impose arms embargoes, travel bans and asset freezes. A United Nations al Qaeda committee is expected to decide when it meets Thursday. Nigeria's request lists the terror group as an affiliate of al Qaeda. This is a "significant step" in the fight against terror, said Joy Ogwu, the Nigerian ambassador to the United Nations. The United States branded Boko Haram a terrorist group last year, providing greater access to its finances and more ability to limit its movements. U.S. officials have said Boko Haram does not have financing in the United States. The insurgent group has escalated its attacks in Africa's most populous nation as its bloodletting extends far beyond its hotbed in the rural northeast. In attacks that appear to be getting more frequent, twin blasts killed at least 118 people Tuesday at a market in the central city of Jos. The explosions went off 20 to 30 minutes apart, sparking an inferno that sent crowds running and screaming, covered in blood. Nigerian authorities described the blasts as "terrorist activities" but declined to speculate on who might be responsible. In separate attacks in Borno state this week, at least 30 people were killed by members of the terror group, according to local residents. Boko Haram attackers swooped in on motorcycles Monday and killed 10 people in one village, residents said. A day later, gunmen stormed a nearby village and killed 20 others, residents said. During the attacks, Boko Haram set fire to homes and food stores, residents said, and fired machine guns. The group has not claimed responsibility for those attacks. Both villages are close to where the more than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped. Boko Haram claimed responsibility in a chilling video and said he was willing to free the girls in exchange for imprisoned militants. "These vicious attacks on defenseless Nigerian civilians and Boko Haram's abduction last month of more than 200 girls in Chibok are unconscionable, terrorist acts demanding accountability and justice," the U.S. State Department said in a statement. Officials condemn attacks, vow to stamp out terrorism The sudden escalation of attacks, together with the failure to find the missing schoolgirls, has spread concern about the government's inability to quash the insurgency. Protesters have gathered daily nationwide to express frustration over the lack of progress in rescuing the schoolgirls. "Last weekend in Paris the international community and regional leaders made clear their collective determination to support Nigeria and defeat the scourge of terrorism," the UK Foreign Office said in a statement. "The Jos attack has only strengthened our resolve." Nigeria and four neighboring countries -- including Chad -- will share intelligence and border surveillance in the search for the missing girls while Western nations will provide technical expertise and training in a new effort against the extremists. The plan was announced over the weekend during a security summit hosted by French President Francois Hollande to address the growing threats from the group. Boko Haram translates to "Western education is a sin" in the Hausa language. It says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/22/politics/military-force-authorization/index.html	politics	Setback for ending the 'never-ending' war - CNN.com	2014/05/22	Thursday May 22 10:28:53 EDT 2014	Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration and many of its national security critics agree that it's time to revisit the war authorization that Congress approved a week after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. But when to end it and how to replace it is another matter. The House defeated an amendment by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, that would have "sunsetted" the so-called "never-ending war" a year from now. Attention now turns to the Senate and whether a proposal will emerge there. The law authorized a military response to the terrorist attacks by striking back against al Qaeda and associated forces, including their Taliban allies, who at the time ruled Afghanistan. Its scope is broad enough that it has been used by successive administrations to carry out military attacks as far afield as Africa and Yemen. When to end it is a prickly enough issue that the White House has done little to move ahead with President Barack Obama's promise, as described in a 2013 speech at the National Defense University, to work with Congress to "refine and ultimately repeal" the Authorization for Use of Military Force, or AUMF. As in other national security policy fights -- that of drones, for instance -- the rise of tea party-affiliated libertarians and Obama's sagging popularity have scrambled some of the traditional alliances on the war authorization. Liberals and right-leaning libertarians who criticize the war authorization as too much of a blank check to the President are uniting to support a repeal of it as a way to assert congressional authority. Some conservatives -- who not long ago supported extending the current AUMF -- now suggest replacing it with a law that specifies the groups the U.S. is fighting. "I think we have abdicated our responsibility to define the nature of the conflict we're in," Schiff said in an interview. His amendment appeared to have gained steam, in part because the White House has struggled to make clear what it thinks should happen. At a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing Wednesday, senior lawyers from the Defense and State departments said repealing the law would do no harm to national security or affect military operations, because the President's executive powers allow a military response to any threats to the nation. And yet, they wouldn't say whether the administration supported ending the war now. "We're not here to say it should be repealed today," said Mary Mcleod, deputy legal adviser at the State Department. The issue matters because U.S. forces are exiting a war in Afghanistan that lasted more than twice as long as World War II. Some legal experts believe that development adds some pressure to replace the existing AUMF, in part, because the main al Qaeda forces that attacked the U.S. have been decimated, even as new offshoots have metastasized the terrorist threat to parts of Africa, Syria and the Arabian Peninsula. Michael Mukasey, attorney general under President George W. Bush, said at the Wednesday hearing that he supports the idea of Congress revisiting the authorization to clarify its intent. Harold Koh, the State Department's top lawyer under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, said the law should be narrowed and eventually repealed. Administration officials say part of the complication lies in ongoing negotiations with Afghanistan over whether the United States will retain forces in that country after this year, a deal that can't be reached until after Afghanistan elects a new president in June. "As we work with the government of Afghanistan to identify an appropriate U.S. military presence in Afghanistan after 2014; as we continue to make progress towards the closure of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay; and as we continue to work with our friends and partners around the world to provide assistance and training to counter al Qaeda and its associated forces, we will engage further with Congress and the American people on efforts to ensure that the legal authorities for our counterterrorism and detention operations are appropriately tailored," said Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the National Security Council. "In keeping with our ongoing efforts to realign our forces and capabilities after the drawdown in Afghanistan, we look forward to engaging the Congress on the President's goal of refining and ultimately repealing the AUMF," she added. Only three years ago, Congress was being pressured to expand the authorization. In 2011, Rep. Buck McKeon, R-California, tried to pass a new AUMF to reaffirm the war against al Qaeda and to try to restrict the President's hand on issues such as the plan to close the Guantanamo prison. McKeon's push to give the existing war authorization more life has partly influenced the Obama administration's effort on the issue. Two administration officials told CNN that part of the reason for the White House's hesitation is the fear that some congressional hawks would use the opportunity to expand the so-called War on Terror. Or that the administration could end up without any authorization at all. In his State of the Union speeches this year and last, Obama said he aimed to pull the United States back from its "permanent war footing." Some congressional critics say Obama's policies appear to prematurely declare victory over al Qaeda's core leadership, and ignore the growing threat from affiliates such as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and groups fighting in Syria, Iraq and Libya. With partisan bickering sowing gridlock in Congress, passing any law on the war authorization is a tall order. Congress is also debating surveillance law changes in the wake of the leaks about the U.S. government's spying activities by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Schiff scoffs at the notion it's too hard to tackle. "We drafted the AUMF in days after 9/11; we should be able to do this in a year," he said. After all, "one of the most important things that Congress does is to declare war and define the focus of that war."  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/politics/thad-cochran-profile/index.html	politics	Sen. Thad Cochran, a quiet pragmatist facing re-election challenge - CNN.com	2014/05/27	Tuesday May 27 05:09:24 EDT 2014	Washington (CNN) -- The devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina along the Mississippi coast was fresh in Haley Barbour's mind when he met with Sen. Thad Cochran and other members of the congressional delegation about aid in 2005. "My first trip to Washington after Katrina, Senator Cochran said, 'You tell me what the state needs and I'll try to get it,'" Barbour told CNN. "He never deviated from that and ultimately he succeeded." Cochran did it, Barbour and political observers said, by employing the same sort of quiet, persistence that has marked his 36-year tenure in the Senate. He worked behind the scenes, talking with colleagues, negotiating and eventually he was able to net $29 billion in relief money. He also worked across the aisle with Democrat Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana to reform the law governing federal disaster relief policies aimed at helping communities recover. Their efforts helped ensure that the victims of broad devastation, such as the type seen after Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy in 2012, could get aid for housing and rebuilding. "In our time of greatest need, he was the giant in the delegation for Mississippi," Barbour said. Now, one of the longest serving lawmakers in Congress is facing a very different type of storm. Cochran is a septuagenarian facing a serious challenge from arch-conservative Chris McDaniel, a state senator who is just over half his age and has the grassroots support of the tea party, the Club for Growth and Sarah Palin. The stakes are especially high in Mississippi as the tea party reels from Republican primary setbacks in Kentucky and other states this spring. Blogger's arrest shakes up Mississippi Republican primary The race leading up to the June 3 primary vote has gotten ugly. This month, police arrested political blogger Clayton Kelly after authorities said he broke into a nursing home where Cochran's wife, Rose, has lived for roughly 14 years and snapped pictures of the elderly woman which ended up in a political attack ad on YouTube, according to The Clarion-Ledger. Both Cochran and McDaniel denounced the act, but the fallout has led to accusations of dirty politics through attack ads. "I think Senator Cochran is generally viewed positively by the electorate as a whole," said John Bruce, chairman of the University of Mississippi's political science department. "However, among those voters who are likely to take part in the Republican primary, his numbers are not as high." Though the Cook Political Report and the Rothenberg Political Report both have the senate seat as remaining solidly in the Republican column, Stuart Rothenberg in April wrote: "Cochran, 76, is in trouble  in deep trouble  primarily because of changes in the Republican Party. But it's also true that the senator, and his campaign, didn't start his re-election effort where they needed to be." Complete Coverage: 2014 Midterm Elections That's partly because the very thing Cochran has cited as a strength: his tenure in Washington and power broker status, has been used by his tea party backed opponent to paint him as an antiquated Beltway insider. In 2010, Citizens Against Government Waste, a non profit government spending watchdog group, dubbed Cochran the "king of earmarks" after he netted roughly $490 million for projects he favored. Cochran has served as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the Agriculture Committee. In this role, he was able to help net federal funding for his alma mater, the University of Mississippi, for medical research, as well as money for defense contractors and protected the interests of Mississippi farmers, Barbour said. "He has worked hard in the state to make sure Mississippi got its fair share," Barbour said. Barbour's nephew, Henry, is an adviser to Mississippi Conservatives, a super PAC that is trying to get Cochran re-elected. Still, the challenge from McDaniel has Cochran on the defense, Bruce said. "I think McDaniel's campaign is a little bit of tea party, a little bit of personal attacks, and a little bit of ambition on McDaniel's part," Bruce said. "The mystery going forward is the magnitude of any impact from the photos of the senator's ailing wife." Short-lived tea party victories? The race's tenor seems a departure for someone who, friends like Barbour said, prides himself on being "a true gentleman." "He is a true gentleman. He is gracious, never says anything bad about anybody," Barbour said. "He is a quiet, but very able colleague. He's always been held in very high regard by people in both parties." Cochran's mother was a school teacher; his father was a principal. This educationally steeped environment helped shaped his core values, the lawmaker has told the media over the years. Though he was a high school football star in Hinds County, Mississippi, he decided to join the cheerleading squad at the University of Mississippi  an experience he credits with his first taste of politics. Key races to watch in 2014 "You had to go around to the different residence houses and fraternity and sorority houses and campaign, answer questions and make a little speech about why you thought you'd be a good cheerleader," Cochran told Roll Call in 2011. Fellow Mississippi Republican and former Sen. Trent Lott was also an Ole Miss cheerleader a few years after Cochran. Cochran followed his cheerleading stint with service in the Navy. He earned a law degree, practiced and also headed Richard Nixon's 1968 campaign in Mississippi. Cochran was elected to the House in 1972, serving three terms before moving on to the Senate. "I think he's a pragmatic politician that understands getting a half a loaf most of the time is better than never getting anything while you hold out for a whole loaf," Bruce said. 
http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/15/politics/midterms-101/index.html	politics	2014 midterms: What's at stake - CNN.com	2014/04/15	Tuesday Apr 15 02:31:10 EDT 2014	Washington (CNN) -- Their approval rating is horrendous. They rarely get along or get anything done. So here's your chance to do something about it. With the entire House of Representatives and more than a third of the Senate up for election in November, there's a lot at stake in these midterms. Here's what on the line: Control of the Senate: That's the big story of the year. Republicans have their best chance of winning back the majority since they lost it in the 2006 elections. Democrats hold a 55-45 seat majority (53 Democrats and two independents who caucus with them) and could lose control of the chamber if they drop six seats. That matters because Republicans would then likely control the House and the Senate. Government would be truly divided with President Barack Obama, a Democrat, still in the White House. Republicans would likely pass more legislation through Congress and the President would be forced to either allow GOP priorities to go through or stop them in their tracks with a veto. Democrats face a difficult task of maintaining their Senate majority. Of the 36 Senate races this year (a third of the Senate is up for election every two years), Democrats hold 21 seats. In other words, they are forced to play major defense. The Cook Political Report says Democrats have an extremely slim chance of keeping their seats in South Dakota and West Virginia, where the current Democratic senator in both is retiring and the states' electorates are likely too conservative to elect a new Democrat. So the Democrats' defensive playbook comes down to seven races in red or purple states that they could lose: Louisiana, Arkansas, North Carolina, Alaska, Michigan and Montana and Iowa. In addition, Republicans are hopeful they have a chance to knock off Democratic incumbents in Colorado and New Hampshire. In other words, they have multiple paths to retaking the Senate. More on the key Senate races "Democratic control of the Senate is at considerable risk, with the party at no better than even money to retain control in November," wrote Stuart Rothenberg, editor and publisher of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report, one of the top political handicappers. But it's not all roses for the GOP. It has a few seats to defend, too. And one of those is that of the party's leader, Mitch McConnell in Kentucky. Democrats recruited a young candidate who is running a solid campaign. She is a legitimate threat to McConnell. And in Georgia, the retiring Saxby Chambliss has left the door open for Michelle Nunn, a Democrat with a family history in Georgia politics, to beat a field of Republicans who are pushing each other to the right. Little drama in the House: Republicans currently have a strong advantage in the House: They control 234 seats compared to 201 for Democrats. What team wouldn't love a 33-point advantage on game day? What that means is that Democrats must pick up 17 seats to reclaim the majority they lost in the 2010 midterms. But that's unlikely because the party that controls the White House usually loses seats in a president's sixth year. But only 17 seats out of 435 are rated tossups, according to a CNN analysis. That's less than 5%. CNN estimates that another 33 could change hands, and some surely will, but the risk is a bit lower. House races to watch Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the Rothenberg Political Report, said that is pretty standard. "That's close to normal for a mid-decade, non-wave election year," he said, adding that more districts become competitive after redistricting at the start of every decade. In the last census, Republicans dominated the redistricting game because they controlled the entities, mostly state legislatures, that are in charge of drawing new districts. As Democratic voters tend to be clustered in urban areas and Republican voters in the suburbs and out in the country, Republicans control more districts. There are a lot more rural districts than urban. In 2012, House Democrats won 1.17 million more votes, but the GOP won 33 more seats, according to an analysis by the Cook Political Report. The role of Obamacare: Republicans think they have a winning issue -- Obamacare. The deadline to enroll in the Affordable Care Act for the year has come and gone, but Republicans think voter anger over the law is here to stay and they've made it a campaign priority to highlight it as the President struggles with dismal approval ratings. Republicans point to the only test case they have: Florida's 13th Congressional District where David Jolly beat Democrat Alex Sink in a special election in March. The deep-pocketed third-party group Americans for Prosperity is all in, playing in dozens of races using the sole weapon of Obamacare. "We do want to make sure that Obamacare is the No. 1 issue in the country," Tim Phillips, president of AFP, said in a recent interview. "This data pretty clearly shows that even though attitudes regarding the ACA are 'baked in' with voters (68% feel strongly one way or another about the issue), the intensity is clearly on the negative side, as GOP voters clearly dislike the new law more than Democrats are in love with it," said GOP pollster Neil Newhouse, a co-founder of Public Opinion Strategies. Republicans hit a nerve with Obamacare  Democrats looking for something to rally around: Democrats are working to do everything possible to motivate their base. A March CBS News poll found that while 70% of Republicans are excited to vote only 58% of Democrats are. The enthusiasm gap doesn't bode well for Democrats who are well aware that Democratic voters are less likely to vote in non-presidential election years. Even the head of the committee tasked with electing Democrats to the House admits it. Rep. Steve Israel says Democratic candidates have a tough time in midterms. "Well, look, there's a tough climate, no question about it," he said on CNN's "State of the Union" in April. While Republicans have vitriol over Obamacare to motivate their base, Democrats think they've found their go-to: equal pay and minimum wage. Democrats seize on equal pay as midterm issue Those are two issues that speak to voters personal pocketbooks, especially those of women and people of color -- groups that are more likely to work a minimum wage job and get paid less than a white male. Oh, and two groups that vote less often in midterms. "It's extremely potent," Democratic pollster Celinda Lake said recently. "It's the No. 1 issue that gets single women out to vote, but it also unites men and women." Pollster Stan Greenberg wrote in a recent memo that 72% of 2012 voters say they are "almost certain" to vote in 2014, but only 66% of unmarried women say that. "Among voters likely to vote in 2014, the generic ballot is tied. Among those who voted in 2012 but who are not likely to vote in 2014, Democrats hold a 16-point margin. This is a big deal," Greenberg said. For Democrats, intensity is paramount Republican regrouping: The Republican Party learned from Obama's impressive ground game during the 2008 and 2012 elections. This will be the first opportunity for the GOP, led by the Republican National Committee, to use new data gathering techniques, technology and on-the-ground campaign volunteer recruitment to expand their base and persuade voters. RNC Chair Reince Priebus praised those efforts during the Florida-13 special election. Why the RNC built a year-round ground game The RNC says it has recruited 14,000 precinct captains in targeted congressional districts and Senate and gubernatorial races around the country. That operation in 2014 will lay the groundwork for the 2016 presidential election, spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said. The role of independents: In the CBS News poll cited above, independents are least excited about voting. Only 47% said they were compared to 70% of Republicans and 58% of Democrats. That's, in part, why this election is going to be "more about each side getting out their base," Gonzales said. Gonzales said that independents voting in midterm elections tend to decide who to vote for based on their feelings about the direction of the country and their approval of the President rather than on specific issues. He said they shouldn't be completely discounted, however, in close races, where they could play a deciding role. Putting their money where their mouth is? In case you haven't been paying attention to politics, there's a battle waging within the Republican Party. Conservative groups unhappy with establishment members are working to beat some incumbents who they think aren't pure enough. The Senate Conservatives Fund (SCF), FreedomWorks, Club for Growth and various tea party groups are playing in Republican primaries. And some of those primaries include those for the seats of McConnell, Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi and Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas. They are involved in a series of House races, too, including Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho. But these groups might be more bark than bite running against the well-funded Republican establishment. In a telling case, Texas Sen. John Cornyn easily won his primary against tea party backed challenger Rep. Steve Stockman in March, but he spent $2.6 million in the final weeks to do it. A Boehner bypass? House conservatives have their own midterm message  The conservative groups haven't been able to raise that kind of money so far. For instance, in the 12 candidates it backs, the Senate Conservative Fund has spent $2.6 million on races and given another $2.1 million directly to candidates. The role of the moneyed men: Since the Supreme Court's campaign finance decision Citizen's United in 2010, the role of individual investors in the political sphere has grown. During the 2012 election, casino magnate Sheldon Adelson spent at least $98 million, according to an investigation by ProPublica. The wealthy entrepreneurs, Charles and David Koch, spent $130 million in 2012 through their organization Americans for Prosperity, which works to defeat Democrats. They also donated money directly to candidates and political action committees as well. It'll be interesting to see how the high rollers play in the midterms. With no one candidate at the top of the ticket, will they be willing to spread their money around to impact multiple races or wait for 2016 to put all of their dollars in one tank? The Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity has already spent well above $30 million and plans to spend a lot more. A wealthy former hedge fund manager, Tom Steyer, hopes to play big as well. Focusing on climate change, he pledged to spend up to $50 million of his own money and hopes to raise another $50 million. Opening act for 2016: Let's face it, the midterms haven't even happened yet but the presidential race is well under way. Potential Republican hopefuls are already spending large amounts of time in early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Is 2016 election starting earlier than 2012 did? And on the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton is asked "the question" seemingly every hour. While the midterms will determine the next two years in Washington and the President's ability to govern, it won't predict what could happen in the presidential race two years later. That's because the electorate is much different. It's bigger. It's more diverse. But it could have an indirect impact on 2016 as Republicans will have an opportunity to establish a track record for the public to judge, especially if they win back the Senate. Control of the states: Thirty-six states are electing governors this year, including California, Texas, Florida, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. While the political parties want control of the state houses to implement policy priorities, whether that's the Affordable Care Act for the Democrats or cutting taxes for Republicans, the larger picture is always in view. As multiple Republican governors up for election this year are considering a presidential run, including Wisconsin's Scott Walker and Ohio's John Kasich, Democrats think that if they lose, it will make it more difficult for them to run for higher office in 2016. Republicans hope their ground game to try and elect Republican governors pays off for 2016 by creating an infrastructure to help elect a Republican to the White House.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/26/politics/gun-policy-recap/index.html	politics	Competing mental health bills set up partisan showdown - CNN.com	2014/05/26	Monday May 26 04:59:56 EDT 2014	Washington (CNN) -- It is a tale of tragedy meets election year politics. As the nation reels from yet another deadly mass shooting, this time a gun spree in California which left seven dead, including the gunman, this weekend Congress is poised to consider two rival congressional proposals -- one from a clinical psychologist, the other from the victim of a deadly high shooting -- aimed at addressing the thorny issue of gun policy reform and mental health. One measure, sponsored by Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pennsylvania, a clinical psychologist, seeks to get states to revise standards on committing the severely mentally ill deemed in need of treatment to hospitals. His bill, which has bipartisan support, also includes a controversial proposal that seeks to also empower families and judges to intervene on behalf of severely mentally ill adults and, in some cases, compel court-ordered therapy. Murphy's bill would also significantly dial back federal funding to the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which spends more than $3 billion every year on mental health care. Murphy does not think the agency is effective. "The privacy laws (like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) were to prevent mistreatment from health care ... not meant to keep people from being treated in health care," Murphy said on CNN's New Day on Wednesday adding that, in many of the recent mass shootings, the parents were aware of the gunman's mental health issues but were legally powerless. "People knew when something was going on. What about the rights of society? When someone says 'We don't want you forcing them into treatment,' look, I get that. But society is saying when the signs are there, that someone is gravely disabled or gravely ill from mental illness, a brain illness, treat them. Denial is not a treatment." A competing measure, authored by Rep. Ron Barber, D-Arizona, a politically vulnerable former aide to Rep. Gabrielle Giffords who was shot during the 2011 attack on the congresswoman, seeks to more broadly improve access for all to mental health help through additional federal financial assistance for counseling, research and education efforts. His measure has the seal of approval from a number of mental health organizations including the the National Association of School Psychologists, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and Mental Health America, among others. "We know that one of every four Americans will have a mental illness at least once in their lifetime. Investing in mental health services in our communities and early identification and prevention of mental illness will save both lives and money," Barber said in a statement on his Web page. The pending showdown over the two measures -- neither of which directly addresses the type of mass gun violence that ended lives in Santa Barbara, Newtown and so many other cities -- sets the stage for a partisan fight over overhauling the nation's mental health system. "It's not what's in their hands, it's what is in their mind and heart that we've got to deal with," Murphy said on "New Day." Young, angry and socially alienated  The debate will unfold as the nation digests the actions of Elliot Rodger, 22, a former Santa Barbara City College student who police say fatally stabbed three people and shot three others in that city before taking his own life, Friday. His parents had alerted authorities to their son's mental illness and signs, they say, pointed to the danger he might one day pose. And, as has happened after Columbine, Virginia Tech, Fort Hood, Tucson, Aurora, Newtown, Washington and other shootings in other places, the victims' families and neighbors plead for justice, for an end to gun violence, for a change in laws. "What, what has changed? Have we learned nothing? Where the hell is the leadership," a weeping Richard Martinez, whose son, Christopher, a University of California Santa Barbara college student who was shot by Rodger, told CNN. "My kid died because nobody responded to what happened at Sandy Hook." Father of shooting victim chastises politicians, demands new gun laws In what has become part of a familiar ritual following mass shootings in America, advocates call for action and politicos, especially those in Washington, project solemnity before retreating to their respective corners of the intractable gun debate. "Shame on us for allowing this to continue," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, who championed firearms reforms that failed in Congress following the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, that jolted the nation in December 2012. The White House wound up putting into force nearly two dozen executive actions after Newtown that included improved training for first responders and efforts that focused on federal mental health care assistance. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, and Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, also addressed the issue smack in the thick of a midterm election year with Congress out on recess and time running short before the November vote for lawmakers to act, even on easy stuff. Appearing on CBS' "Face the Nation" on Sunday, Blumenthal said the tragedy could prompt lawmakers to reconsider mental health issues as they apply to gun laws. Thune steered clear of a broader mention of reforms around guns. Tackling mental health and gun policy is a thorny issue, but one that needs to be addressed, Rep. Peter King, R-New York, told The Washington Post. "We've got to look at how we define mental illness, who is denied weapons and who is not, and focus the discussion," King, who has pushed for tougher firearms measures, told the paper. "We have to have this debate." But political experts say there's little visibility on the issue, even if the conversation centers on mental health, which has routinely presented itself in the roster of America's mass shootings. As details emerged over the weekend in California, Rodger's history of mental health issues apparently was no secret to his family. A family friend said he had seen therapists since childhood. Further influencing prospects for any action is where America stands. The public push for reforms is fickle and is largely influenced by moment-to-moment tragedy, said Cedric Alexander, the chief of police for DeKalb County, Georgia, a clinical psychologist and adviser to the pro-gun rights group Independent Firearm Owners Association. "Our attention span is so short we never focus on this complicated problem long enough to address the problem, let alone begin to fix it," Alexander said in a statement. Support for gun control has hit peaks and valleys since 1993. That's when the Brady Bill came about after the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan and established a federal background check program for gun purchases. According to a CNN/ORC International survey conducted in December, 49% of Americans said they supported stricter gun control laws, while 50% opposed them. That fell from the 55% who backed tougher measures a few weeks after the Newtown shootings. Short attention span Stymied federal legislative actions have sent advocates for stricter controls looking for new ways to have an impact. The gun control fights have now moved to the states where legislatures have weighed more than 1,000 proposals, according to an analysis by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The battle over gun policy: Old fight, new strategies  And according to data collected for CNN by the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than half of the nation's legislatures -- those dominated by Republicans -- weighed bills that would have nullified any federal ban on military style assault weapons and limits on large magazines. Republican-led Georgia this year approved a "guns everywhere bill" that allows residents with concealed carry permits to bring guns into houses of worship, school areas, government buildings, some bars and some areas of airports. Gun-control advocates have had some success as well. In Connecticut, lawmakers passed sweeping legislation that included a partial assault weapons ban and restrictions on magazines holding more than 10 rounds. Colorado's Democratic-controlled legislature also approved a tougher background check measure but not without political consequences for several lawmakers who were recalled because of their votes. Will states go where Congress hasn't on gun laws? Mental health measures A number of measures at the state level deal with mental health. In South Dakota, the GOP-controlled legislature passed a bill requiring that mental health records of "someone acquitted of a crime by reason of insanity" be sent to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. According to data from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System, roughly 1% of gun permit applicants who failed to pass a background check over the past 14 years, or 10,180 people, were denied for reasons related to mental health. The White House is also pushing to fund gun violence prevention studies for the first time in roughly 20 years, an effort resisted by Republican critics who accuse the Obama administration of playing politics with taxpayer funds. Big debate, big money Millions of dollars have been poured into the fight by groups representing both sides of the debate. Last month, wealthy businessman and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg pledged $50 million toward gun control efforts. The National Rifle Association, on the other hand, has spent enormous sums over the years to influence lawmakers. "For many years, the gun lobby has had an advantage both in terms of funding and a well-organized and committed grassroots, which it has used to hold back efforts to strengthen gun laws that are supported by the vast majority of Americans, including the vast majority of gun owners," Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told CNN last month. "For years, politicians felt that there was more to lose than to gain by supporting much-needed reforms to keep guns from dangerous people," Webster said. For the families of victims, Martinez is the most recent grieving parent calling for action. "These will continue until somebody does something," he said.

She is a nationally syndicated columnist, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of "Cooking With Grease: Stirring the Pots in America." She was manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential campaign in 2000. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- It's been a long time. A very long time. But I cannot forget my first school lunch. Call it free or call it charity, but it was a good meal that provided me, and so many others, with sustenance that made our school days more delightful. Our meals honored the traditions of the time -- red beans and rice with smoked sausage, bread and perhaps dessert. And of course every Friday we had fish sticks, potato salad or French fries. We've come a long way since then. Today, most public school children get perfectly balanced meals. School chefs use food selected to provide maximum nutrition, food that will enhance a student's well-being and learning abilities. Their standards come from federal nutrition experts in the U.S. Department of Agriculture who survey what important foods are missing from children's diets. More than 90% of the nation's schools follow these criteria. Come September, guidelines for healthier snacks will be added. Still, for all our efforts, the White House reports that, because of a poor diet, one-third of our children are on the path to diabetes. Regulations implementing the nutritional guidelines must be legislated by Congress. As it considers the Agriculture Appropriations Bill, Congress -- especially House Republicans -- will have to decide if it represents the interests of our children or of special food lobbyists. For example, the Maryland-based School Nutrition Association has sought, and received, congressional support to grant a one-year waiver from the standards to schools that can demonstrate six months of financial loss. The group represents 55,000 school lunch workers and nutritionists. But The Washington Post quoted a health professional who said the group reflects its funders, who are mostly frozen food and agribusiness interests. Getting our children healthy lunches has had bipartisan origins. The healthy school lunch program was put forth during the George W. Bush years, and strengthened with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act Michelle Obama saw successfully to adoption in 2010. Implementing USDA healthy lunch standards has met with some schools' resistance, according to the Government Accountability Office and the School Nutrition Association. But why? After all, a USDA study found only 0.15% of the schools surveyed said they were having difficulty complying with the healthy foods standards. And the same study found that upward of 90% of the schools involved are successfully meeting the guidelines. That finding confirms another study done in 2012 by the Kids' Safe and Healthful Foods Project, "a collaboration between The Pew Charitable Trusts and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation that provides nonpartisan analysis and evidence-based recommendations" on food standards. It found 94% of school districts were on board to meeting the healthy food guidelines. Jessica Donze Black, a nutritionist and director with Pew, told the press, "We are disappointed (with this waiver) that would weaken national nutrition standards for foods served in schools." Indeed, more than 100 child nutrition experts at national, state and local levels released a petition to Congress on May 19, requesting lawmakers fight, and end, the waiver to opt out of all the breakfast and lunch standards for schoolchildren. We are beginning to reverse childhood obesity; it has fallen among preschoolers. But childhood obesity doubled during the past 30 years. Our progress is tiny but encouraging. The proposed waiver appears to be an attempt to buy time so the frozen food industry and agribusinesses can worm their foods into the schools. The provision is opposed by hundreds of nonpartisan, nonprofit nutrition organizations and supported by just a handful of powerful junk food interests. Congress appears willing to gamble with our children's health at the same time Olivier De Schutter, a U.N. health expert, declares that "unhealthy diets are greater threat to health than tobacco." Ironically, De Schutter calls for global regulation of salty, sugary foods, just when some members of Congress seem ready to abandon our own standards. Providing our children with healthy food will reduce future health care costs. So why is this too being turned into a partisan dodge? Republicans in Congress have limited a pilot program that will test efficient ways to deliver foods during the summer only to children in rural low-income households. (This is not to be confused with the Summer Food Service Program, which will continue to deliver meals to urban and rural children alike.) The excuse given by a House Agriculture spokeswoman is that rural children are scattered over wider areas and so "have some unique challenges." As if urban children going hungry don't face "unique challenges." The House version of the Agriculture Appropriations Bill also seeks to add starchy, white potatoes to the list of "qualified vegetables" under the Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, supplemental feeding program for pregnant women and young children. This move comes after heavy lobbying by the white potato industry, which wants the prestige of qualifying for WIC and the marketing advantage that comes with it. Congress should say no to the special interests, stop turning the well-being of our children into a partisan tool and focus on our children's health and their future.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/22/opinion/gergen-veterans-obama-shinseki/index.html	opinion	Gergen: Obama, Shinseki stories on VA medical care don't add up - CNN.com	2014/05/22	Thursday May 22 02:02:42 EDT 2014	But the bureaucracy at the VA, second only to the Pentagon in size, is notoriously sluggish. In 2010 -- four years ago! -- the deputy undersecretary of the VA wrote a nine-page memo saying that in order to cover up their continued delays, various parts of the VA system were engaged in "gaming strategies" -- in effect, lying. The General Accounting Office and VA inspector generals wrote reports saying the practice was widespread. One would have thought that would have set off alarm bells at both the VA and the White House. Where was the anger then? There were some internal investigations, but they never went anywhere and there was little apparent sense of urgency. Six months ago, CNN turned loose its own investigative reporters and aired stories about excessive waits in several facilities across the country. Again, the VA and the White House had little to say. Then a month ago, CNN (along with the Arizona Republic) broke the story from the Phoenix VA that managers there have allegedly been cooking their books to provide false assurances. Veterans awaiting care were dying. The administration seemed to brush the story aside and Shinseki refused repeated requests from CNN for an interview. Recent days have been a political nightmare for the VA. Hauled before Congress to testify, Shinseki testified that evidence suggested only "isolated incidents" in the system. That same day CNN was reporting that there were allegations of misdeeds in at least six centers across the country. The next day the VA itself said there were 10 centers under investigation. By this week, the official number had mushroomed to 26. And weeks after the fact, the VA has rescinded a bonus it gave earlier this year to the boss of that Phoenix operation. In the weeks ahead, the administration now says, investigators will come up with reports and maybe some folks will be forced out. We will see. In the meantime, veterans are still waiting to hear of decisive action to end their long delays in care. When troubles arise in which Americans are needlessly dying, citizens like to think of the president as the fireman-in-chief. He is there in the White House, his team ever vigilant, and at the first sign of danger, he leads his team into action. At his side is the Cabinet officer with responsibility. Sadly, that is not what happened here. For most Americans, the story of VA officials allegedly falsifying records of veterans' care is disgusting. Those old enough to remember will be reminded how the government falsified counts of body bags in Vietnam. But the real issue is whether as a country, we are keeping faith with our veterans -- whether, as Abraham Lincoln urged in his second inaugural, we are binding the wounds of those who fought. Surely, we owe them prompt and professional care -- no more excuses, no more delays, no more b.s. Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/21/opinion/granderson-chicago-obama-library/index.html	opinion	Opinion: Chicago needs help, not Obama library - CNN.com	2014/05/21	Wednesday May 21 10:32:50 EDT 2014	Editor's note: LZ Granderson is a CNN contributor, a senior writer for ESPN and a lecturer at Northwestern University. He is a former Hechinger Institute fellow and his commentary has been recognized by the Online News Association, the National Association of Black Journalists, and the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association. Follow him on Twitter @locs_n_laughs. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- The entryways to some of the University of Chicago dorms near the corner of East 61st and South Cottage Grove resemble the doors of a prison. And if you look around, it's clear that instead of trying to keep trouble locked in, the 123-year-old private school is trying to keep trouble out. The university's stone wall near that intersection appears to have had graffiti scrubbed off. And the U. of C. chose to situate its Department of Safety & Security less than a block away. There are bright yellow signs on nearby telephone poles with the words "safe passage" on them. They arrived last year after a budget crunch caused Mayor Rahm Emmanuel to close 50 city schools, forcing displaced students to walk not only farther from home, but across warring gang territory -- some in this neighborhood -- to attend classes. These students, many of whom are black and Latino, are supposed to stay on the "safe passage" routes to avoid being accidentally shot by fighting gangs. As if bullets can read signs. Against this backdrop, the university is bidding for President Obama's presidential library, with a projected cost approaching half a billion dollars. (The deadline for bids is June 16; Honolulu, where Obama grew up, and New York are also expected to make pitches.) And this has presented Obama with a political -- and arguably moral -- bind that his former community-activist self might have taken on quite differently. Some context: Emmanuel, Obama's friend and former White House chief of staff, is despised by the black community in this town. And at least six shootings happened within blocks of Obama's Hyde Park home this past weekend alone, a situation crying out for solutions and funds to pay for them. Just to the west of East 61st and South Cottage Grove, the residents want the university to build a trauma center to help save the lives of the people living in the high crime/low income neighborhoods that surround it. Currently the university's renowned hospital is unable to treat adults injured in falls, car accidents and assaults, though it does operate a trauma center for children 16 and under. It had a trauma care unit in 1986 but closed it two years later because of annual losses of $2 million -- a combination of high volume, patients without insurance and insufficient public aid. This mattered, for example, to an 18-year-old youth activist by the name of Damian Turner, who in 2010 was caught in the crossfire of a drive-by shooting just four blocks from the school's hospital, but had to be driven 10 miles to be treated. He died en route. In 2013, Northwestern University studied gunshot wounds recorded by the Illinois State Trauma Registry from 1999 to 2009 and found that living more than five miles from a trauma center decreases chances of survival. Adults living on the city's predominantly black south side do not live within five miles of such a center. That's a problem. Opening a $700 million "hospital for the future" -- as the university did last year with its Center for Care and Discovery, focused on cancer, neuroscience and advanced surgery -- while telling neighbors a trauma center is too expensive to run, is also a problem. And it certainly doesn't help that Emmanuel, the man responsible for closing so many schools in this black neighborhood, is lobbying state officials to pony up $100 million for the library. No money to educate black children safely near their homes. Too expensive to run a trauma center to help black victims of shootings. But half a billion for a vanity project with the Obama name on it. With the location of the library set to be named sometime next year, it would appear the President has little choice but to avoid placing the library at the university lest he run the risk of, for one thing, making his My Brother's Keeper initiative look hollow. It's either that or try to force the university's hand -- no adult trauma center, no library. Hawaii is looking better and better, isn't it? This week a local organization, STOP, Southside Together Organizing for Power, is holding a series of peaceful protests on and around the university campus to oppose putting the library there and to raise attention for the need for a trauma center. Their demonstrations started with a sit-in on the construction site for a parking ramp near the school's new Discovery center. Video shows it ended with protesters being dragged off the premises by university police for trespassing, with some protesters injured in the process. "The University of Chicago upholds the right to peaceful and safe demonstrations, but cannot allow protests that jeopardize anyone's safety," a statement read, adding it has established locations for demonstrations. "No arrests were made, and no charges have been planned." And no resolution in the near future. "If the University of Chicago Medical Center cared about the safety of black kids, they would provide a trauma center, because right now in Chicago black kids are the leading population that are suffering from trauma," said demonstrator Veronica Morris-Moore, while holding an icepack on a wrist she said was injured in the skirmish. Next to her was 18-year-old Victoria Crider, whose leg was elevated on a desk, her ankle in an air cast. STOP's office is on East 61st, just a few blocks west of the school. "Barack Obama has made it a point in his administration to not only preserve the life of black people, but black men," Morris-Moore said. "And the university can play a part and they're just choosing not to." She said "there's a lot of burden" on Obama to push for a trauma center. "Clearly they're not listening to us. Clearly they're just going to keep pushing us around ... keep harming us until we go away. And we're not going away. But we are getting tired and we do need help from people the university will listen to. And they will listen to (Obama). So in some respect he does owe us some attention." When more than 40 people are being shot in a weekend -- some in and around that neighborhood -- as happened last month, a lot more than attention is needed. Which could make Obama's return to Chicago every bit as stressful and as political as any day in Washington. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

Follow him on Twitter: @rubennavarrette. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.  San Diego (CNN) -- Normally, when an elected official has to make difficult choices, balancing ambition with practical concerns, it boils down to a personal decision. But when the official is a political rock star who might just be the first member of his community to become president, the whole decision-making process plays out in public. Take the case of Julian Castro, the San Antonio mayor who has now thrown political observers a curveball by accepting an offer from President Obama to join the Cabinet as secretary of housing and urban development. Castro has been talked about before as a potential 2016 candidate for vice president. The idea of his moving to Washington, if he's confirmed at HUD, is sure to keep tongues wagging for the next couple years. It will also provide plenty of opportunity for unsolicited advice. It seems many people have an opinion on whether Castro has made a shrewd career move or derailed an otherwise promising political future. I've known Castro for about 12 years, and he's a friend. I want what's best for him. I'm just not sure this is it. Why should others care about this choice? Well, for starters, because you can't begin to understand America in the 21st century without an appreciation for the footprint being left by 52 million Hispanics -- a demographic estimated to account for 25% of the U.S. population by 2040. Two-thirds of that population is Mexican or Mexican-American, and Castro is the most prominent politician they have. If there was any doubt about that, it evaporated when Obama chose Castro to give the keynote address at the 2012 Democratic National Convention and launched him as a national political figure. People should also care because, in the short term, Castro's selection could energize Hispanic voters in time for the midterm elections and help efforts by Democrats to avoid losing more seats in the House or even to retain control of the Senate. It certainly puts Republicans -- who are already smarting from the beating they took from Hispanic voters in the 2012 election, and who have been trying to make amends -- in a tough spot. If they attack Castro during his confirmation hearing, they'll inflame Latinos who will then turn the GOP into a pinata during the midterms. Finally, people should care because so much of our politics has become boring and predictable, and this surprise selection -- and Castro's willingness to accept it -- is neither of those things. On CNN's "State of the Union with Candy Crowley," pundits speculated about why a big city mayor would come to Washington midway through the second term of an unpopular administration. The answer, they agreed, may have something to do with the assumption that it might be hard for a Democratic presidential nominee to tap a mayor for a running-mate position coveted by governors and senators. The thinking is that, if nothing else, moving into the federal arena makes Castro more attractive to Hillary Clinton or whoever the party's nominee in 2016 turns out to be. The 39-year-old would replace Shaun Donovan, who would move over to take the helm at the Office of Management and Budget. But why would Castro accept the nomination? HUD is small potatoes. There are four major Cabinet posts: Treasury, Defense, State and Justice. On the prestige meter, HUD is much further down the list. Along with the Labor Department, it is one of those outposts in the federal bureaucracy where the minorities almost always end up in charge. There is no barrier being broken; another San Antonio mayor, Henry Cisneros, in 1993 became the first Hispanic to be housing secretary. And Castro seems content in his hometown of San Antonio, a base from which he can fly around the country delivering high-paying speeches and where he's finishing a memoir which had been due out next year and which may now be released even sooner. He has never struck me as someone who is desperate to go to Washington. And yet, now Castro is ready to start packing. The more I think about it, the more I think I understand why he feels compelled to make this move at this point in his political career. For one thing, Castro knows the subject matter. Big-city mayors deal with housing and urban development, along with economic renewal, on a regular basis. He'll be comfortable at HUD. And it doesn't hurt that, if Castro needs guidance, he can turn to Cisneros, a friend and mentor who knows the department very well, since he ran it for four years during the Clinton administration. For another, Castro's political options in Texas -- a dependably red state -- are limited. He could run for re-election as mayor next year, and serve out what would be his final term until 2017. Then what? He could enter the private sector, and make a comfortable living practicing law, giving speeches, and writing books. But his political career would be over, just like those of many Texas Democrats before him. His decision to join the Cabinet is a wild card, but one that might just keep him in the game.

Jones is president and founder of Rebuild the Dream, an online platform focusing on policy, economics and media. He was President Barack Obama's green jobs adviser in 2009. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors. (CNN) -- The numbers are arresting. If Americans under correctional supervision counted as a city of their own, they would form the largest city in the United States after New York. The number of people in prison, on parole or on probation, 6.9 million Americans, exceeds the populations of the second- and third-largest cities, Los Angeles and Chicago, combined. Or the size of the next four -- Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix and San Antonio -- put together. Thirty-eight U.S. states are home to fewer people than live under the corrections system in this country. There are about as many people behind bars as live in Chicago. That's one in every 108  Americans. One in 35 are under some form of correctional supervision. Among African Americans, the numbers are even more horrifying. According to the NAACP, one in three black males born in the United States today is likely to spend time in prison at some point in his life. That's compared with one in six Hispanic males or one in 25 white males. It would be hard to overstate the scale of this tragedy. For a nation that loves freedom and cherishes our rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, the situation should be intolerable. It is destroying lives and communities. Our corrections system is not correcting. Within three years of being released from prison, nearly half of prisoners are convicted of another crime with one out of every four ending up back in prison. When a typical bureaucracy does its job this badly, it wastes money, time and paper. The corrections bureaucracy, in failing to correct the large majority of inmates in its charge, not only wastes money but also wastes lives, families and entire cities. The current system is broken beyond repair. It's a human, social and financial disaster. We need a radical strategy of replacement of these huge bureaucracies that lack any meaningful oversight. A number of states, most recently Mississippi, have already begun to take important first steps by directing nonviolent offenders to community supervision and other forms of correction. These measures keep violent offenders off the streets and lesser offenders out of prison, where too often the only education they receive is how to become a more hardened criminal. In Hawaii, Judge Steven Alm has pioneered a model of probation enforcement that has dramatically reduced violations through consequences that are immediate, predictable and proportionate. New York City created a social impact bond to finance prisoner rehabilitation programs run by a nonprofit organization. They will pay out to investors based on savings from a decline in recidivism. There are no doubt countless similar reforms that would reduce rates of incarceration, and we should pursue them. But it is also time for more fundamental changes. We need to rethink prisons, parole and probation for the 21st century. At a time when high-quality education is increasingly digital and in many cases free, shouldn't we provide opportunities for prisoners to learn skills that will enable them to support themselves as upstanding citizens when they are released? We know that inmates who earn a GED while incarcerated are substantially less likely to return to prison. There are readily available online tools that our prisons could use extensively for a minimal cost to increase the number of inmates receiving valuable education and skills training. Khan Academy has replicated virtually the entire K-12 curriculum online for free. Udacity and other online education sites offer introductions to software programming for free. Our prisons should be using tools such as these extensively. They offer the opportunity to interrupt the cycle of poverty, a failing education system, crime and incarceration. At most prisons, however, inmates would never be allowed to spend eight hours a day working on educational courses and are instead forced to mill about their cells with little or nothing to occupy their time. Of course, there are significant barriers for convicted felons to get jobs even with education programs. But without some training, it's almost impossible for many. And with tight budgets and increasing prison populations, states have already been cutting back on the rehabilitation component. Technology should revolutionize more than just the prisons' rehabilitation programs. It should completely transform the corrections and criminal justice systems. Van is involved in a computer science education initiative for urban youth called #YesWeCode, which in February held a "hackathon" with students in Oakland, California. One of the hacks the kids came up with was an app to remind them of their court dates. It's sad, but in an age when the dentist's office calls automatically to remind us of appointments, shouldn't the court system do that as well if it prevents kids from spending time in jail? Similarly, technology should enable much more effective probation and community supervision, especially new options that could allow nonviolent offenders to remain with their families living productive lives under an appropriate level of restriction. Almost any activity to which we might sentence low-level offenders --apprenticeship programs, school, literacy or computer science boot camps, community service -- would be a better use of taxpayer dollars than sticking them idle in prison with hardened criminals. Unfortunately, the current corrections bureaucracy has embraced none of this innovation -- in part because it is captive to the prison guards' unions or the private prison lobby, and in part because it lacks any incentives or sufficient competition based on the right metrics. The incarceration industry has grown into a billion dollar industry, with corrections being among the most expensive budget items in many states, increasingly outpacing what they spend on higher education. Opinion: Justice system is failing young black men Years ago, Van proposed that states give wardens a financial incentive to cut the rates of recidivism for inmates leaving their prisons. More than 65% of inmates in California return to prison within three years of their release, where they will again cost taxpayers an average of $47,000 each year. Surely it is worth giving wardens a substantial portion of the savings for every inmate that leaves their prison and does not re-offend. Such incentives would spark dramatically more innovation and investment in rehabilitation, job training and job placement programs for prisoners. That would be a revolutionary change from prison administrators' current incentives, which are often to keep as many people in custody as possible. Finally, we need real market competition that rewards success at every step of the process -- in probation and parole offices as well as prisons. That doesn't just mean privatizing prisons or rewarding probation services with the same failed metrics. We need competition of methods and ideas based on the right criteria: When we send prisoners home, do they have the skills to reintegrate in their communities as working, law-abiding citizens? Or do they end up coming back? With more than 2 million of our fellow citizens in prison and millions more in danger of returning, Americans on both the left and the right should be able to agree on the need to replace our broken corrections system and work together to do so. Through Rebuild the Dream's #Cut50 initiative, at CNN's "Crossfire" and elsewhere, we will be working together to explore ways to reduce the prison population substantially in the next decade. We should start by opening our prisons and probation offices to innovation to save money, achieve better outcomes for individuals and ensure better safety for us all.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/14/opinion/costello-pro-life-pro-death-penalty/index.html	opinion	Opinion: Can you be pro-life and pro-death penalty? - CNN.com	2014/05/14	Wednesday May 14 07:56:46 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Carol Costello anchors the 9 to 11 a.m. ET edition of CNN's "Newsroom" each weekday. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- Can you be pro-life and pro-death penalty? It's a question more than one person I know is asking after Oklahoma's botched execution of Clayton Lockett. Not necessarily because of the way Oklahoma tortuously executed the convicted killer, but because of the hard-core way some reacted to Lockett's execution. Like Mike Christian. The pro-life Oklahoma state representative told The Associated Press, "I realize this may sound harsh, but as a father and former lawman, I really don't care if it's by lethal injection, by the electric chair, firing squad, hanging, the guillotine or being fed to the lions." He also threatened to impeach judges who dared delay executions for any reason. This is from a man who is so strongly pro-life he voted for eight bills in four years to prevent women in Oklahoma from terminating their pregnancies, or, as many who oppose abortion say, "killing babies." Color me confused. So, Rep. Christian says it's OK to kill, unless you're a woman who wants to end her pregnancy? As I told my friends during a heated debate last weekend, that smacks of hypocrisy. The only nonhypocritical viewpoint, I argued, exists in the Catholic Church. Catholics believe in the "Consistent Ethic of Life." As Georgetown's Father Thomas Reese puts it, "we are concerned about a person from womb to tomb." "Life is something that comes from God and shouldn't be taken away by man," Reese told me. Put simply, the Catholic Church opposes abortion and the death penalty. Period. Except nothing in life is that simple. Especially our collective views on the death penalty and abortion. If you ask a Southern Baptist, he or she will likely tell you the Catholic Church is wrong. "There is no contradiction here," R. Albert Mohler, president of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, told me, referring to Rep. Christian's underlying position. Christian's words were "careless," and don't "reflect any Biblical ... defense of the death penalty," he says, but it does not defy logic if Christian is pro-life and pro-death penalty. "It's not an eye-for-an-eye kind of thing," explained Mohler. "Retribution is not the same as a demand for justice. In Genesis 9, God speaks to Noah after the flood. When someone takes human life, they forfeit their own life." So, I asked, "Should a woman who's had an abortion forfeit her own life?" Mohler emphatically answered, "no." Lockett deserved to die, he said, because the act of murder "was taken in wanton disregard of the life taken and given the nature of the crime, this individual has forfeited his right to live." (Lockett not only raped and shot his victim, but ordered his accomplice to bury her alive.) Don't get me wrong; pro-lifers could argue that pro-choice, anti-death penalty believers are inconsistent, too. How can you choose to end life, but adamantly oppose the death penalty? Apparently, consistency is not America's strong suit. According to a 2010 study, only about 8% of Americans oppose abortion and the death penalty under all circumstances. James Unnever, professor of criminology at the University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee, co-authored the study. He expected his test results to show a consistent belief system in all kinds of premeditated death. In other words, if you believe in the sanctity of life, you would be opposed to euthanasia, the death penalty and abortion. Turned out, that was not remotely true. "From a religious position, the Catholic faith is the most consistent life ethic," Unnever says. "Religion is only one factor that affects using the death penalty." The other factor, he says, is politics. "When you get people who are against abortion and for the death penalty, that's not as much a religious effect as a politics effect. Politics trumps any religion." Jacinta Gau, professor of criminal justice at the University of Central Florida, co-authored two studies on attitudes about abortion and capital punishment. She was also surprised by the inconsistency many showed toward life issues. Of those who strongly oppose abortion, yet strongly approve of the death penalty, Gau says: "What seems to link those two attitudes together is related to fundamentalism, a literal interpretation of the Bible, and an inflexible way of viewing society in general," Gau says. "I'm not sure they really view it as a contradiction. There's a punitive attitude toward this -- kind of like if you don't want a child, don't engage in risky sexual behavior; if you kill someone, you deserve death." And Gau says pro-choice, anti-death penalty believers also don't see a contradiction. Those who are pro-choice don't "see abortion as ending a life," she says. "The death penalty becomes completely separate for the pro-choice people, because it's about a woman's right to choose." Truth told, the "Consistent Ethic of Life," is relatively new to the Catholic Church. For centuries, the church supported capital punishment. But passionate pro-life and death penalty foes, such as Sister Helen Prejean, convinced the church that "helping to kill a defenseless person" in any circumstance is wrong. "What's more innocent than an unborn baby?" Prejean told me. "It's easy to be against that." Then Prejean went for the jugular. The people who commit terrible crimes, "Could you kill them? If there's a part of you who can't say yes to that, then you can't say yes to the death penalty." I must admit I was humbled by Prejean's question. Couple that with the fact we can now lock up violent criminals for life and I, again, find myself arguing for the "Consistent Ethic of Life." As for Mohler, the Southern Baptist leader, he offered me this final thought: "If I had the opportunity to trade the death penalty for the affirmation of protection of the life of the unborn, I'd take it in a second."

http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/30/opinion/omara-death-penalty/index.html	opinion	Opinion: Execution, a 19th-century relic we still can't get right - CNN.com	2014/04/30	Wednesday Apr 30 01:56:58 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Mark O'Mara is a CNN legal analyst. He is a criminal defense attorney who frequently writes and speaks about issues related to race, guns and self-defense in the context of the American criminal justice system. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- If anyone deserved the death penalty, it was Clayton Lockett. He committed a series of vile acts that we as a civilization would condemn under any circumstances. In August 2000, a jury in Oklahoma found Lockett guilty of first-degree murder, rape, forcible oral sodomy, kidnapping and a bevy of other charges -- 19 in all. They stemmed from a robbery-gone-wrong in which victims were tied up at gunpoint; one young woman was raped multiple times, and another, who had just graduated from high school, was shot and buried alive in a ditch. On Tuesday night, Lockett was scheduled to die by lethal injection -- the preferred means for executing criminals in states that allow for the death penalty. During lethal injections, subjects are given a chemical cocktail designed to put them to sleep, render paralysis and then stop the heart. One problem for death-penalty states, such as my state of Florida, is the chemicals used for lethal injection are hard to come by, partly because some companies who produce the chemicals refuse to sell them for the purposes of executions. So in the case of Lockett, the state of Oklahoma tested a new combination of chemicals. Instead of putting Lockett to sleep and stopping his heart, the administration of the lethal injection caused his vein to burst, and about 45 minutes later, he died of a heart attack. It's been dubbed a "botched execution," and Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin stayed another execution scheduled for Tuesday evening pending an investigation. This is an absurd problem for states to wrestle with -- this notion of how to kill someone properly. Like I said, if anyone deserved the death penalty, it was Lockett, but the real debate is whether we need to be in the business of trying to find the least cruel and least unusual way to kill anyone voluntarily. It seems clear that the death penalty is a 19th-century relic, and our ridiculous struggle to figure out how to do it properly in the 21st century is a signal that perhaps we should join the rest of the civilized Western world in abolishing executions. Even Russia hasn't had an execution since 1999, and I wouldn't exactly call Vladimir Putin soft on crime. But please understand that I am not some left-wing, dyed-in-the-wool liberal who simply believes all criminal behavior is the fault of a system that fosters deviance. Not at all. I believe that if you take somebody's life with premeditation, and if a jury, after hearing all of the evidence properly presented by competent counsel, finds you guilty, then you should die -- but in prison, at the end of a life sentence. My objection to the death penalty is pragmatic. It's ineffective as a deterrent, and it is an extraordinary burden on our justice system. For a punishment to offer an effective deterrence, it has to be applied swiftly to maintain the logical cause and effect relationship with the crime, that this is a consequence. But we simply cannot, and should not, act quickly. The extended period required to ensure that the death penalty is appropriate -- that all options and appeals have been exhausted before resorting to the ultimate punishment -- is an essential safeguard in a civilized society. In Lockett's case, this process took nearly 14 years. Even with this long process of appeals, our system is far from perfect. Innocence projects around the country have saved 144 death-row inmates since 1973 by presenting new evidence that has proven them not guilty. Think of how many innocent people we have executed, when the number should be zero. We should all be shocked and appalled. Since we know innocent people sometimes get convicted based upon bad identification, faulty witnesses, improper police activities and incompetent counsel, can't we at least agree to avoid killing somebody when we know we have an imperfect system? And the burden of the appeals process on the criminal justice system is huge. A recent report from Amnesty International shows the average cost to carry a death penalty case from prosecution to execution is three to 10 times more than a case with a life sentence. Very often, a life sentence costs the state less than $1 million. Some death penalty cases have cost more than $10 million. The excruciatingly long, and necessary, appeals process in death penalty cases cost taxpayers millions for each case, and it draws resources away from other important prosecutions. Is it worth the price? It would be worth the price, if that was what it took to get justice. But is the death penalty justice? Or is it retribution? Often in a death penalty case, members of the victim's family are the strongest advocates for a death sentence. They say they want justice for their slain loved one, but what they often truly want is retribution. This is both understandable and acceptable. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. But it's never that simple. I've tried death penalty cases, and I've been lucky: None of my clients has ever been sent to death row. But I know many good lawyers who haven't been so lucky. You may be surprised to know that in many death penalty cases, which last for years, defense lawyers get to know victims' families. The families of homicide victims, after an execution, often don't feel the long sought-after sense of relief they expected. Often, they are left, instead, with unresolved emptiness. Two lives are lost when a murder is committed, and two families are irrevocably altered. We should feel the pain as well, and spend more time, effort and money on those who are affected. We should not spend ever-dwindling resources figuring out ways to kill. The death penalty is flawed in every conceivable way, and it should be abolished.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/24/opinion/navarrette-affirmative-action/index.html	opinion	Opinion: Why a minority opposes affirmative action - CNN.com	2014/04/24	Thursday Apr 24 02:33:36 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Ruben Navarrette is a CNN contributor and a nationally syndicated columnist with the Washington Post Writers Group. Follow him on Twitter: @rubennavarrette. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.  (CNN) -- When it comes to thinking about affirmative action, there's an old way and a new way. The old way was in full bloom this week at the Supreme Court, in a blistering 58-page dissenting opinion by Justice Sonia Sotomayor in what was a state's rights case involving a 2006 Michigan law banning the use of racial criteria in publicly funded college and university admissions, and the question of whether these matters can be settled not just by courts but also by voters. The new way is on display in California, where lawmakers who want to amend the state constitution to reinstate racial and ethnic preferences at public colleges and universities -- something that was banned by a 1996 ballot initiative -- have a formidable opponent in the form of a group that knows a little something about discrimination: Asian-Americans. Under the old way of thinking, the narrative goes like this: There was once in this country ugly, overt and systematic discrimination based on race or ethnicity. African-Americans in the South and Mexican-Americans in the Southwest were excluded not just from barbershops, country clubs and public swimming pools, but also from places that could change the destinies of individuals and uplift families -- colleges and universities. There had to be a corrective device, the thinking went, by which these institutions that had previously treated race and ethnicity of certain groups as a negative could flip the script and treat it as a positive. Some people saw it as a reparation, a historical payoff. But it was more of an acknowledgment that discrimination leaves behind vestiges, and institutions that once went out of their way to be unwelcoming to certain groups now had to go out of their way to be welcoming to those groups by taking applicants' race and ethnicity into account. This is how Sotomayor, a graduate of Princeton University and Yale Law School, sees the program that she has often credited for opening those doors. In her dissent in the Michigan case, part of which she read aloud to her colleagues, the nation's first Latina Supreme Court justice wrote: "This refusal to accept the stark reality that race matters is regrettable. The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race, and to apply the Constitution with eyes open to the unfortunate effects of centuries of racial discrimination. As members of the judiciary tasked with intervening to carry out the guarantee of equal protection, we ought not sit back and wish away, rather than confront, the racial inequality that exists in our society." Anyone out there support racial inequality and think it ought to be preserved? I didn't think so. Besides, this case wasn't about whether racial and ethnic preferences are good or bad, but whether their use could be restricted by voters at the state level. By a vote of 6-to-2, the high court ruled that it could be. Meanwhile, in California, there is a group that -- like Sotomayor -- really dislikes racial inequality. So much so that they don't think it ought to be reinstated by the state legislature under the pretext of expanding educational opportunity. In Alabama or Georgia or Mississippi, the dominant racial storyline is black-and-white. But in California, the most interesting relationship -- the one that will help define the future of the nation's most populous state -- is the relationship between Latinos and Asian-Americans. At 38% of the population, Latinos now make up a plurality in California. Yet the fastest-growing minority in the state is Asian-Americans, who now make up nearly 14% of California, or more than twice the number of African-Americans. And just as Latinos are divided on issues such as immigration and bilingual education, so, too, are there differences of opinion among Asian-Americans when the conversation turns to affirmative action. Still, what sends shock waves through the debate in California is that one of the most prominent subsets -- Chinese-Americans -- is opposed to the idea of colleges and universities taking into account race and ethnicity. Organizations representing that constituency pressured a small group of Asian-American lawmakers to stall the legislation. They did. You might think that an ethnic group that holds nearly 40% of seats in the University of California system would have little to complain about. You'd be wrong. Asian-American organizations that oppose racial and ethnic preferences claim that the 40% figure could soar to 50% or 60% if colleges and universities awarded slots based on merit. They insist that there is a quota to keep the Asian-American students below 50%, and that this primarily benefits white students who might not be able to compete head-to-head with Asian-Americans. Welcome to affirmative action, California-style, where things get complicated. As the debate plays out in this state, you don't hear much about "reparations" or the "vestiges of discrimination." The dominant themes are "merit" and "fairness." Those are not small things. Let's put to rest the old way of thinking about affirmative action and confront the new challenges that lie ahead in a country that, with every passing day, resembles less and less what it used to be.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/24/opinion/summers-georgia-gun-law/index.html	opinion	Opinion: Gun law packs dangers, police chief says - CNN.com	2014/04/24	Thursday Apr 24 11:48:15 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Warren Summers, the chief of police in Norcross, Georgia, has been a police officer since 1976. He has also worked as an assistant district attorney. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- On Wednesday, Gov. Nathan Deal signed Georgia's Safe Carry Protection Act into law. Many gun proponents love House Bill 60, but it will create unintended problems for law enforcement, local governments and the citizens they serve. Although changes in the state's gun laws were meant to strike a balance between the rights of gun owners and the government's interest in protecting its citizens, unintended consequences may follow that don't make anybody safe. Picture this: It's a pleasant summer day. The kids are out of school, and you've decided to take them to the local park. You're sitting on a park bench in the shade, watching them play, when you suddenly notice a man dressed in a heavy winter coat approaching the playground. As he scurries past you, you notice a handgun strapped around his waistband. Alarmed? You should be. Who is this man, and why is he armed at your children's playground? Concerned enough to call the local police? Not a bad idea, but here is the problem. Starting July 1, law enforcement in Georgia will not be able do much for you. As a matter of fact, they could get sued if they detain the man you called about and ask him whether he has a valid weapons carry license. That's because, under Georgia's revised Safe Carry Protection Act, it is prohibited for police to detain someone for the purpose of checking for a license. So much for safe. But wait, it gets better. Worried about convicted felons toting guns? Rest assured, convicted felons are still prohibited from possessing firearms in Georgia -- except in the act of self-defense. But, you might ask, don't you have to possess a firearm first in order to be able to use it in self-defense? Correct. So, what kind of sense does that make? It doesn't. It encourages gun ownership and use by convicted felons. Think about it. All they have to do now is claim "self-defense." Feeling safer already? Finally, Georgia's revised Safe Carry Protection Act may also cost you more money. Before this law, cities could simply prohibit firearms or any other weapons in government buildings by posting a sign; now, they can do so only by screening entrances into the government building with security personnel. And guess who ends up paying for that? That's right, the taxpayer. And if the police officer is sued for asking to see a gun carry permit, who will pay for his or her defense? It will be up to the municipality, using taxpayer funds. But not only does it cost us more, it also has a chilling effect on open government. Many citizens might feel discouraged from visiting their local government offices, knowing that they are now subject to being screened. While these revisions certainly favor the rights of gun owners, they create dilemmas for local law enforcement and government. As a police chief, my main concern is the safety our residents. As police, we have taken an oath to protect and serve, and this new law doesn't help us.  Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/29/opinion/gorod-cell-phone-scalia-court/index.html	opinion	Opinion: What Scalia knows about illegal searches - CNN.com	2014/04/29	Tuesday Apr 29 12:24:29 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Brianne Gorod is appellate counsel at the Constitutional Accountability Center, a progressive law firm and think tank. Gorod is a former law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer and was an attorney-adviser in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. She is one of the authors of her firm's amicus brief in Riley v. California and United States v. Wurie, two cell phone privacy cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- It won't surprise anyone that Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a scathing dissent in a Supreme Court case that came down last week. But it might surprise some people that three members of the court's so-called liberal wing joined him. Scalia argued that searching the car of Prado Navarette, pulled over on suspicion of drunken driving, violated the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor agreed. This seemingly idiosyncratic lineup is a developing bloc in Fourth Amendment cases, and it's one to keep any eye on as the court hears two even bigger such cases Tuesday. In Riley v. California and United States v. Wurie, the court will consider whether the police may search the contents of an arrestee's cell phone without a warrant. This means that if you get arrested for jaywalking or littering (and in some places, you can be), the police can search your smartphone -- and everything on it. There should be little doubt about what Scalia will say about these searches. He has become a regular champion of the Fourth Amendments protections against "unreasonable searches and seizures." In Navarette v. California, Scalia disagreed with the court's conclusion that the police could lawfully stop a car after a woman anonymously called 911 and reported that the car had driven her off the road. Scalia wrote that such stops were not the constitutional framers' concept of a "people secure from unreasonable searches and seizures." And in Maryland v. King, a case decided last term, Scalia disagreed with the court's conclusion that the police may lawfully take a cheek swab of someone's DNA after he or she has been arrested for a serious offense. He expressed "doubt that the proud men who wrote the charter of our liberties would have been so eager to open their mouths for royal inspection." Those proud men adopted the Fourth Amendment in large part to respond to the British use of "general warrants." These warrants were not specific about the people or items to be searched and thus gave the government broad discretion to search people's homes and the personal papers and effects within. The Fourth Amendment was adopted to ensure the American people would not be subject to such broad searches. As Scalia put it simply in the King case, "suspicionless searches are never allowed if their principal end is ordinary crime-solving." That's precisely why the police should not be able to search the modern-day equivalent of one's "papers and effects" -- the contents of one's cell phone -- without a warrant. Fortunately, there's reason to think that Scalia won't be on the losing side of this one. To start, searches of cell phones have the potential to be far more invasive than the searches in Navarette and King. In Navarette, the search was a brief traffic stop. Even the search in King -- a light swabbing of the cheek -- while more physically invasive, does not reveal all of a person's most private communications and the intimate details of one's life the way searches of a smart phone can. Consider all the information on your smartphone -- not only e-mails and texts and call logs, but also apps that reveal a tremendous amount about you. Moreover, King involved a booking procedure when an individual was taken into custody for a serious offense. Indeed, the court went to great lengths to emphasize that the search would only be imposed on individuals charged with serious crimes. Not so the searches at issue in Riley and Wurie, which could take place after any arrest. Further, unlike in Navarette and King, robust enforcement of the Fourth Amendment in these cases will not hamper law enforcement. In Navarette, a ruling against the government would have meant the police could not stop the car; in King, they could not have taken the cheek swab. Here, the police can still seize the cell phone at the time of arrest and, assuming there is probable cause, they can subsequently obtain a warrant to search the phone. Finally, the last time the court confronted a case involving a similar Fourth Amendment question -- another search following a lawful arrest -- Scalia was on the winning side: Justice Clarence Thomas also concluded that the search was unreasonable, and Justice Stephen Breyer suggested he might have if the Supreme Court had not already addressed the exact question at issue in that case. The court hasn't before confronted the question at issue in Riley and Wurie -- cell phone searches. But even though the question is new, it's one for which history provides an answer. The framers didn't want the government to rifle through people's most personal papers and effects in the absence of individualized suspicion that they might provide evidence of wrongdoing. As Scalia will surely recognize, and as all of his other colleagues should as well. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/14/opinion/levin-jewish-center-shootings/index.html	opinion	Opinion: Hate-filled violence threatens us all - CNN.com	2014/04/14	Monday Apr 14 01:11:37 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Mark H. Levin is the pulpit rabbi at Congregation Beth Torah in Overland Park, Kansas. He has lived in the greater Kansas City area since 1976. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- As Jews prepare for Passover, our community has been hauled into the violence that plagues our nation. At this moment, we don't know for certain whether the killings Sunday at two Jewish Centers in Overland Park, Kansas, were aimed exclusively at Jews, but it certainly feels that way. In a larger sense, we have been victimized by the random, hate-filled violence that steals lives and futures in this country daily. Perhaps it is no coincidence that this hateful attack occurs at Passover. It surely threatens Jews' sense of security and multiplies the fear that we are persecuted. I wish, however, that you could know of the loving calls I am receiving from friends and clergy all over the wider metropolitan area and indeed around the world. Our neighbors: Jews, Christians and Muslims are outraged that senseless murder would be aimed at our community. We live among friends, and that is very different from Pharaoh's Egypt, Nazi Germany or any other place in which Jews have suffered persecution. We are being singled out, but in a larger sense we are not, because this is no longer a unique act of terror. Rather, the scourge of violence in America threatens us all. Those who hate as a way of life must be rooted out, isolated and punished. As Jews, we are no strangers to violence or wanton hatred. Many of us grew up with the fear of persecution. But we are not alone, either in our suffering or in our fears. Our newspapers report daily murderous acts against one group or another: blacks, gays, children, Muslims, minorities of all sorts. Many of the perpetrators are not sane; many of the victims are unsuspecting. The more proximate we are to the event, as the Jews of Overland Park were on Sunday, the more vulnerable and violated we feel. But look at the reality. At least two of those killed were not the apparent intended targets: Jewish people. They attended a nearby Methodist church. They were, tragically, in the line of fire because they had come to the Jewish Center to be part of an event, further evidence that this nation does not single us out as a hated minority but accepts us as beloved members of society and friends. Rather, our fear and our concern should be directed at a society that will not spend the resources to provide care for the mentally ill, will not limit the means by which violence is perpetrated and does not share common social purpose sufficient to protect us all from these random killings. For that, we are all guilty. We need to search our souls to ask why we, as a society, allow these daily murders to continue. On Sunday, Jews were apparently singled out. Tomorrow, it could well be another group, and Overland Park will recede in memory. But the truth is that we are all bound by our human experience and the tragic violence that is overwhelming the United States, ending lives and destroying families. Our prayers are with the victims and their families. They must be our main concern, as well as those who feel threatened by random violence. Sunday demonstrated that any of us could be singled out, and therefore we see we are one people that must be united in our conviction that we will not tolerate the hatred that murders innocent people and tears at the body of our nation.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/23/justice/indianapolis-colts-owner-charged/index.html	crime	Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay charged with impaired driving - CNN.com	2014/05/23	Friday May 23 04:50:12 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated and possession of a controlled substance on Friday, just over two months after his arrest, a prosecutor said. The misdemeanor charges filed Friday are pending in Hamilton County, Indiana, Superior Court, Prosecuting Attorney D. Lee Buckingham's office said in a press release. The drug was identified in a court filing as oxycodone and/or hydrocordone. Irsay's initial hearing on both counts is scheduled for June 19. The Colts owner and CEO's legal team, in a statement after the charges were announced, thanked the Hamilton County prosecutor's office "for its professionalism in its investigation." The statement pointed out that authorities determined that "the facts in this matter did not warrant the filing of felony charges relative to Mr. Irsay's prescription medications. "Mr. Irsay will deal with the remaining misdemeanor charges through the judicial process," the statement added. Police in Carmel had earlier said that Irsay was stopped at 11:41 p.m. on March 16 for driving slowly, stopping in a roadway and failing to use his turn signal. The probable cause affidavit indicates that the Colts owner's speech was "slow and slurred," his eyes were "red and glassy" and his balance was "very unsteady." He failed a number of field sobriety tests, had trouble reciting the alphabet and told an officer "that he was having a hard time finding his house." In addition, a search of his vehicle found prescription drugs in bottles, police said in a press release. The drugs were not associated with any prescription bottles in the vehicle, according to police. The next day, Irsay "voluntary checked into a highly respected health care facility," according to the Colts. "(He) is committed committed to undergoing the treatment and care necessary to help him meet his challenges head-on," added the team. Irsay is the first National Football League owner to face criminal charges since Eddie DeBartolo of the San Francisco 49ers was indicted on federal racketeering charges in 1997. In that time, the league -- including its current commissioner, Roger Goodell -- have frequently punished players for off-the-field indiscretions that landed them in court. It remains to be seen what will happen, then, to the 54-year-old Irsay, who has largely stayed out of the public spotlight -- except for regular tweets -- since his arrest. In a brief statement Friday, the league said, "The NFL's Personal Conduct Policy applies to all league personnel and holds all of us accountable. We are reviewing the matter and will take appropriate action in accordance with the policy. The Colts owner -- whose father, Robert Irsay, owned the team before him -- has spoken publicly about his struggles with substance abuse as well as his efforts to stay sober. In a tweet last December, Jim Irsay said that he didn't drink: "(S)orry to ruin your theories ... but I don't drink ... at all," he posted on his official account.

Jarrett, 59, was "belligerent and uncooperative" with police officers who responded to a report Wednesday that he was drunk at an airport bar, according to airport spokesman Patrick Hogan. "He is dealing with serious personal issues at this time," a Fox News spokeswoman said in an e-mail to CNN on Thursday. Jarrett was released from the Hennepin County Jail on a $300 bond early Thursday, according to jail records found online. He has a June 6 court date on a misdemeanor charge of obstruction of the legal process and interfering with a peace officer, the record said. TVNewser, a website that covers the television news industry, reported on May 12 that Jarrett was taking time off from his weekend anchor duties on Fox, quoting the network as saying he had "requested time off for personal reasons and Fox obliged." Jarrett joined Fox News 12 years ago and has most recently co-anchored on weekend shows. "A date at which Gregg might return to air has yet to be determined," the Fox News statement to CNN said.

A judge ordered that Carlos Ortiz be held without bail following the plea in a Bristol County, Massachusetts, court. Ortiz and fellow Hernandez associate Ernest Wallace were indicted on murder charges last month. Wallace pleaded not guilty earlier this month. Authorities allege that Hernandez orchestrated the June shooting death of Lloyd in North Attleboro, and that Ortiz and Wallace were in a car with Hernandez that night. Hernandez, 24, is charged with first-degree murder and weapons charges in the death of Lloyd, a 27-year-old semi-pro football player. Hernandez also was charged this month with two counts of first-degree murder in the July 2012 killings of two men in Boston. Photos: Athletes charged with murder  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/justice/red-sox-announcer-son-guilty-murder/index.html	crime	Jared Remy, son of Red Sox announcer, guilty of killing fiancee - CNN.com	2014/05/27	Tuesday May 27 05:04:29 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Jared Remy, the son of famed Boston Red Sox broadcaster Jerry Remy, pleaded guilty in a Massachusetts court Tuesday to killing his fiance Jennifer Martel just days after he was arrested for assaulting her. Remy, 35, was sentenced Tuesday to life in state prison without the possibility of parole after changing his plea to guilty after he was charged with the August 2013 stabbing death of Martel, 27. "Jared Remy perceived that he was losing control of Jennifer Martel and lashed out at her in a fit of rage, killing her," Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said in a statement. "Today, with this plea, the defendant has been held accountable for his actions. This plea ensures that Jared Remy will spend the rest of his natural life in prison." The gruesome details of the case rippled through the small community of Waltham, Massachusetts, after questions surfaced about why Remy had not been held on bail after his arrest just two days before the slaying. Remy was arrested on August 13 for assault and battery after Martel told police that Remy had grabbed her neck and head and "slammed her face against a mirror" in the bathroom during an argument, according to a Waltham police report. Martel fled the home with the couple's daughter to a neighbor's home and called 911. Martel could be heard on the call, which was released by police, saying "(Remy) is just a very violent person who is on lots of medication who might need serious help." Domestic violence facts When Martel filed for a restraining order, she told police that Remy had been arrested before for assaulting an ex-girlfriend, according to police. Remy was arrested by Waltham police after the incident and charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. He was arraigned the next morning and released after posting just $40 for the bail fee, according to Waltham District Court documents. The next day, Remy returned to the Waltham home he shared with Martel and their child and stabbed her multiple times. The couple's daughter was home at the time, according to police. The Middlesex district attorney's office conducted an internal review after Martel's death, which resulted in some countywide procedural changes on how domestic abuse cases are handled. Remy is the son of famed Red Sox color commentator Jerry Remy. The elder Remy played for the Red Sox as a second baseman from 1978 to 1984 and was voted an all-star his first year with the team. Remy is also considered the president of Red Sox nation, according to the Red Sox homepage. Massachusetts abolished the death penalty in the early 1980s when lawmakers ruled it was unconstitutional. Remy will spend the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of parole. 'Shield' actor Michael Jace officially charged with wife's murder  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/justice/gambino-family-member-sentenced/index.html	crime	Man gets life in 1981 killings of bar owners, other crimes - CNN.com	2014/05/27	Tuesday May 27 08:01:41 EDT 2014	New York (CNN) -- Relatives of a bar owner killed more than 30 years ago over a spilled drink said Tuesday the life sentence given to a reputed mobster has finally brought them justice. Bartolomeo Vernace, 65, was sentenced in U.S. District Court to life without parole plus 10 years for his 2013 racketeering conspiracy conviction. Criminal acts from 1978 through 2011 included drug trafficking, illegal gambling and the 1981 double homicide of Richard Godkin and business partner John D'Agnese, according to prosecutors. They said Vernace held key roles with the Gambino organized crime family. "Thirty-three years is a very long time to wait for justice. We have our closure, but we have been waiting for justice," Godkin's daughter, Christine Orsini, told the court shortly before the sentencing. Vernace, wearing glasses and a blue jumpsuit, declined to make a statement prior to his sentencing. Defense attorneys Charles Carnesi and Joseph DiBenedetto said there will be an appeal. Vernace has maintained his innocence, Carnesi said. Family's long journey for justice in case Godkin and D'Agnese ran the Shamrock Bar in Queens when they were killed the night of April 11, 1981, after a dispute between an alleged Gambino family associate and others in the bar over a drink spilled on his girlfriend. According to the U.S. Attorney's office, the patron left the crowded bar and picked up Vernace and a third accomplice. They went to the bar and gunned the "two innocent bar owners" down, authorities said. Vernace, also known as "Bobby Glasses," went into hiding in the weeks after the slaying, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office statement, but would emerge years later to take an active role in the Gambino family. Vernace was charged in 1998 in Queens County Supreme Court with the deaths of Godkin and D'Agnese, but was acquitted of state charges after trial in 2002, according to prosecutors. According to all accounts, no witness could identify Vernace. It wasn't until Vernace was arrested in January 2011 as part of a national sweep of 100 alleged members and associates of organized crime that he was brought up on the federal racketeering charges. During the federal trial in 2013, an eyewitness testified he recognized all three assailants in the bar but lied during the state trial out of fear, saying "two men were dead over a spilled drink. I think that was reason enough to be afraid." That eyewitness testified that he saw Vernace point a gun at Godkin's head and saw one of Vernace's accomplices threatening D'Agnese with a gun, according to a 2013 statement by the U.S. Attorney's Office. D'Agnese was shot in the head and Godkin was shot in the chest when he tried to intervene, according to court documents. Godkin's children and grandchildren filled the courtroom Tuesday and embraced prosecutors following the sentencing. "It took too long, but we will take it," Godkin's widow, Catherine Godkin, said outside court. "Justice has finally been served thanks to the lawyers, the jury, and all the witnesses who testified."

The justices, in a 9-0 ruling, also said the police officers involved are immune from lawsuits. The incident in question began in July 2004, when police in West Memphis, Arkansas, questioned Donald Rickard at a gas station about a broken light on his white Honda. Rickard refused to step out the car and then took off. With his girlfriend, Kelly Allen, in the passenger seat, Rickard crossed over the Mississippi River into Tennessee along Interstate 40. After Rickard rammed a police car head-on and sideswiped another, police fired 15 shots into the vehicle, mounted cameras from police vehicles show. The car went airborne and slammed into a house in Memphis. Rickard and Allen, both 44, were killed. Rickard's daughter subsequently sued, saying unreasonable force was used, since her father was neither armed nor had just committed a serious criminal offense.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/22/us/california-kidnap-victim-found/index.html	us	Neighbors baffled that California woman was kidnapped - CNN.com	2014/05/22	Thursday May 22 01:06:30 EDT 2014	Tune in to "New Day" during the 8 a.m. ET hour when we'll speak to Charles Frisco, the attorney for Isidro Garcia. (CNN) -- After an August 2004 domestic dispute, police say, a 15-year-old girl left her Santa Ana, California, home, seeking refuge in a nearby park adjacent to an elementary school. Her mother's boyfriend, who police say had just attacked the mother, followed the girl. She told him she wanted to go home, that she had a headache, according to police. The mother's boyfriend told the teen that her mother had called the cops to have her deported and gave her five unidentified pills, police say. She woke up trapped in a Compton garage, about 25 miles from home. And so began a decade-long kidnapping saga that police say came to an end this week when the woman -- now married to her alleged kidnapper and mother to their daughter, 3 -- reached out to her sister on Facebook in April before contacting authorities over the weekend, said Santa Ana police spokesman Cpl. Anthony Bertagna. "You're talking about a 15-year-old, came to this country, doesn't speak English," Bertagna said, explaining how the teen had arrived in the United States only six months before her abduction. "Her mother's boyfriend decides he wants to physically and sexually abuse her. He tells her that her mother doesn't care, that she can't go to the police because they'll deport her." Isidro Garcia, 42, was arrested during a traffic stop Wednesday. He is charged with a felony count of forcible rape, three felony counts of lewd acts on a minor and a felony count of kidnapping to commit a sexual offense. If convicted of all three crimes, he could face life in a state prison, according to prosecutors. Until he's given the chance to convince the court otherwise, Garcia is being held on $1 million bail; if he somehow posted that, he'd stay detained because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has a hold on him. "We're not talking about consensual sexual contact, we're talking about a forcible rape, and we're talking about repeated sexual abuse, emotional abuse and physical abuse," Farrah Emami, an Orange County District Attorney's spokeswoman, told reporters Thursday. "... This is a victim, no matter how you spin it." Garcia's lawyer, Charles Frisco Jr., says his client is the one suffering, needlessly, now. "He didn't do this," Frisco told CNN's Anderson Cooper. "It's that simple." Accused's lawyer: 'She was very independent' To hear Frisco tell it, Isidro Garcia is a "stellar" husband, a doting father, a hard worker and a good man -- the type who worked two jobs, held raffles for disadvantaged children and loved his wife. "I was told by numerous people that he treated her like a queen," Frisco told reporters, citing relatives, friends, neighbors, a nanny, even a police officer who knew the family. "He was devoted." Isidro Garcia was not someone who held his wife against her will all these years, according to Frisco. Despite being repeatedly pressed by CNN's Cooper, the lawyer said he didn't have all the facts to confirm or deny that the alleged victim was only 15 at the time. Regardless, Franco insisted, "there's nothing" to the prosecution's case beyond her claims. "She had her own car. She had her own job," the lawyer said. "She was very independent -- completely free." Frisco mused that it didn't make sense for her to suddenly come forward now, after a decade together. He speculated it might have had something to do with marital problems, saying the couple was in the process of splitting up. "We all know what happens when people break up," Frisco told CNN. "The marriage falls apart. People get angry. People say things that aren't necessarily true." Decade-long mystery But authorities say that it wasn't easy for this young woman to muster the courage to come forward. The fact it took her a decade to do so doesn't change the fact numerous crimes were committed, they say. Lt. Scott Fairfield of the police force in Bell Gardens, where the woman -- now 25 -- had been living in an apartment with her husband and child, said she walked into the police station on her own earlier this year and said she had been kidnapped and "held ... against her will." The alleged victim told police that Garcia began sexually assaulting her in June 2004, shortly after she arrived in the country. Her mother suspected as much but had no evidence, a police news release said. When the teen woke up in the single-car Compton garage, its only exit was blocked by a vehicle, she further told police. Garcia gave her false identification and made her work with him as a janitor at a night cleaning service, Bertagna said. He kept a close eye on her at work, while physically, mentally and sexually abusing her, telling her that her parents weren't looking for her, the police corporal said. They moved four times to avoid being discovered, Bertagna said, and the two times she tried to escape, she was caught and "beaten for her efforts." In 2007, Garcia married the girl in Los Angeles, police say, and in 2012 they had a child together. It's that child who gave the woman the courage to finally report her abduction, Bertagna said. "She wanted to break the cycle so the child wouldn't be abused," he said. 'Happy' reunion between mother, daughter The alleged victim tearfully told CNN affiliate KABC the same thing and explained that she was afraid to report Garcia or seek help from her Bell Gardens neighbors because everyone thought Garcia was a good husband and provider. "He was a workman. He works hard for me and my daughter and bought everything I want," she told the station, her back to the camera as she held her daughter. "I need the love of my family, not things." She said that despite maintaining the facade of the happy couple, she longed only to be reunited with her family during the 10 years she was with Garcia. "I'm so happy and God-blessed to be with my family. That's what I want all the time. All the time I cry for them, more for my mom and my sisters," she said. "I think I was alone, but I wasn't ever. My family was with me." The woman's mother had one word to describe the reunion with her daughter. "I'm so happy. God is everything," she told KABC. "Happy, happy, happy." No sign of abuse Neighbors don't know what to think. They recall "Tomas" and his wife, who also used a pseudonym (CNN is not identifying the woman because she is an alleged rape victim), as a happy couple who liked to dance at their elaborate parties complete with catering and clowns. Photos obtained by CNN affiliate KNBC show an apparently normal couple, embracing and grinning for the camera. "They'd be happy, kissing, holding hands," said Maribel Garcia, who has lived at the same apartment complex as the couple for four years. A next-door neighbor who identified herself only as Erika said Isidro Garcia -- whom she knew as Tomas -- was really nice, and Erika spoke to the couple every time she saw them. When the alleged victim became pregnant, "she was really happy with the news," Erika said. "She never showed a sad face or worried face," she said. Yet while Erika was told that the alleged victim's mother never liked Isidro Garcia, a different story was given to Maribel Garcia, who told CNN that she heard Isidro Garcia had recently bought a truck for his wife's mother. Neighbors say Isidro Garcia also purchased a laptop and a car for his wife, and he was paying for womb massages because the couple was hoping to have another child. Neighbors recall meeting the couple's family members, as well as the couple taking trips to visit relatives. Isidro Garcia's wife took off work during her pregnancy, they say, and after their daughter was born, she often took the girl to the park, market or local Circle K convenience store in a stroller. She was regularly unaccompanied, even in her car, they say. "She had plenty of time to actually escape so it's hard to believe this is really going on because she had a lot of free time," Erika said. Added Maribel Garcia, "They just seemed like a happy couple. That why it's hard for us to understand the situation. ... She could've gone to the police station and said something. I just don't understand." Regardless, police insist the woman was not a willing participant in the relationship and she told police she had no desire to have sex, get married or conceive a child. "Sounds like she feared for her life," Bertagna said. "There's more ways to keep people down than just physically." Asked about the neighbors' remarks that the woman should've fled or reached out to police sooner, Bertagna dismissed the idea and noted her age at the time of the alleged abduction. "Where's she going to go?" he asked. "She's 15 years old. She's new here. She doesn't get it."

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/tech/web/rap-genius-fired-shooting/index.html	tech	Tech exec fired for comments about California rampage - CNN.com	2014/05/27	Tuesday May 27 12:17:56 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- The co-founder of Rap Genius, an online-annotation website, has been fired after marking up the 137-page manifesto of California killer Elliot Rodger with comments that are being called tasteless and creepy. Mahbod Moghadam used his site, which lets users post notes interpreting rap and hip-hop lyrics, to comment on Rodger's exhaustive autobiography, which includes his reasons for killing six people in Santa Barbara, California, on Friday before apparently turning a gun on himself. In more than one note, Moghadam called Rodger's writing "beautiful," and in another he speculated on the attractiveness of Rodger's sister. In a journal and in a video posted online, Rodger had expressed frustrations about not finding women to date and resentment toward couples who kissed in front of him. He also wrote that his anger toward women intensified after he overheard his sister having sex with her boyfriend. "MY GUESS: his sister is smokin hot," Moghadam wrote. Moghadam also made comments about a girl Rodger described as the only female his age he ever saw naked. "Maddy will go on to attend USC and become a spoiled hottie," Moghadam wrote, before adding, "This is an artful sentence, beautifully written... ." Rap Genius has removed the notations. But they were captured and reposted online by Gawker, Re/code and other news sites. Why #YesAllWomen took off on Twitter On Monday, Rap Genius co-founder and CEO Tom Lehman released a written statement saying that Moghadam had resigned. "Mahbod Moghadam, one of my co-founders, annotated the piece with annotations that not only didn't attempt to enhance anyone's understanding of the text, but went beyond that into gleeful insensitivity and misogyny," he wrote. "All of which is contrary to everything we're trying to accomplish at Rap Genius." Lehman continued: "Mahbod is my friend. He's a brilliant, creative, complicated person with a ton of love in his heart. Without Mahbod Rap Genius would not exist, and I am grateful for all he has done to help Rap Genius succeed. "But I cannot let him compromise the Rap Genius mission -- a mission that remains almost as delicate and inchoate as it was when we three founders decided to devote our lives to it almost 5 years ago." Lehman said the site, which describes its mission as helping users "discover the meaning of rap lyrics," decided to post Rodger's writings in hopes that users' annotations "will eventually be a good resource for people looking to understand this tragedy." Part One of Rodger's writings currently appears on Rap Genius between breakdowns of the lyrics to "Believe Me" by Lil Wayne and John Legend's "All Of Me." In December, Google penalized Rap Genius after a user exposed what he called a scheme to manipulate search results and drive traffic to the site. The site removed the offending links and regained its Google ranking. As is frequently the case in today's digital world, the social-media backlash against Moghadam's comments was fast and brutal. "Appalling use of technology by already questionable behaving site," Re/code co-executive editor Kara Swisher wrote on Twitter with a link to that site's story. "What's most newsworthy about the story of the Rap Genius founder isn't that he was fired but that he didn't think his words were wrong," tweeted author and tech journalist Ed Bott. Observers also criticized Moghadam's own Twitter feed, which features many posts that could be viewed as crude at best and sexist at worst. On Monday, Moghadam took to Twitter to beg forgiveness for his comments. "I want to apologize to everyone," he wrote. "I need to hear these criticisms, reflect for real, and work on becoming a better person."  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/tech/mobile/hackers-iphones/index.html	tech	Hackers locking iPhones, demanding ransoms - CNN.com	2014/05/27	Tuesday May 27 04:45:19 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- A large number of people, mostly located in Australia, are reporting they have come under an unexplained attack that holds their iPhones and iPads hostage and demands they pay a $100 ransom. The attack appears to work by compromising iCloud accounts associated with the disabled devices, according to an Apple support forum discussion that started Sunday morning and quickly accumulated several hundred posts. Commandeered devices typically emit a loud tone that's associated with a feature that helps users locate lost or stolen devices. iPhones and iPads also display the message: "Device hacked by Oleg Pliss. For unlock device, you need send voucher code by 100 usd/eur (Moneypack/Ukash/PaySafeCard) to email:lock404@hotmail.com for unlock." In some casesspecifically, when a user hasn't assigned a strong passcode to a locked deviceit can only be unlocked by performing a factory reset, which completely wipes all previously stored data and apps. The mass compromise is a variation on so-called ransomware scams, which initially targeted Windows PC users and earlier this month were found targeting smartphone users running Google's Android OS. The forum accounts provide strong evidence that victims' Apple IDs and passwords have been compromised so that attackers can remotely lock connected devices using Apple's Find My iPhone service. But so far it remains unclear exactly how the attackers are compromising the iCloud accounts. While it's possible the hijackers used phishing attacks or hacked password databases to obtain the credentials, those explanations are undermined by the observation that the vast majority of victims were located in Australia and reported using a variety of e-mail providers. Typically, phishing campaigns and database compromises involving multiple providers affect users from more geographic regions. DNS poisoning? One participant in the online discussion theorized the mass compromise may have been the result of hacking domain name system (DNS) servers used by Australian service providers to translate human readable addresses such as Apple.com into the IP addresses Internet routers rely on. Such an attack, which has yet to be confirmed in this case, works by "poisoning" the lookup tables of DNS servers so they secretly direct people to impostor sites. Assuming this technique was at play in the iPhone and iPad locking, affected users who entered a password on what appeared to be Apple's site could have unknowingly provided it to the people behind the attack. Apple officials have yet to comment on the report. There is no indication the hijackings are the result of any compromise on Apple servers, so that leaves end users to figure out for themselves how to secure their own devices. Readers are once again advised to use long, randomly generated passwords that are unique to their iCloud account. They should also enable two-factor authentication and assign a separate, randomly generated passcode to each iPhone and iPad they own. Readers are reminded they can be permanently locked out of their Apple ID accounts, and possibly their iPhone or iPad when running iOS 7 with Find My iPhone turned on, if they are compromised before two-factor authentication is enabled. Two-factor authentication won't automatically prevent an attacker from compromising an iCloud account, but it will prevent the attacker from changing security questions and other crucial settings in the event of a breach. The identities of the people behind the attack are unknown. There's no indication they have any connection to anyone named Oleg Pliss. People with a locked device should immediately try changing the credentials for their Apple ID and ensure two-factor authentication is set up. In the event their locked device didn't have a passcode associated with it, they can perform a factory reset by using a cable to plug the device into their computer while iTunes is open.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/22/tech/innovation/drone-uav-photography/index.html	tech	How to shoot amazing video from drones - CNN.com	2014/05/22	Thursday May 22 07:58:41 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- A bird's eye camera sweeps over the green fields of Ireland, flies over the towering Cliffs of Moher and pans the ocean hundreds of feet below. It's just like a scene in a movie. But this is not Hollywood magic. The spectacular footage was shot, not by a film crew in a helicopter, but with an inexpensive toy drone -- an unmanned aerial vehicle, or UAV, as hobbyists call them -- operated by Andreas Ostermann. And with a few hundred dollars and some practice, you can make breathtaking aerial videos, too. "It is the closest thing to flying like a bird," said Ostermann, an aerial-photography hobbyist who lives in Germany. "My inspiration is to show how beautiful these shots can be and that this hobby is not at all dangerous if you know what you do." The world of remote-control aircraft has been around for decades, but the growth and technological wizardry of UAVs have created a new wave of hobbyists trying their hand at aerial photography. From views of stunning vistas, waterfronts and landmarks to overhead shots of a house about to fall off an eroding cliff or a cheery scene of a fox trotting on ice, there are a lot of creative, fun ways people are using recreational drones for aerial videos. "Originally it was just a bunch of guys tinkering and building things. Now people want to focus on the applications rather than the technology," said Timothy Reuter, founder of the Washington, D.C. Area Drone User Group, the largest UAV club in the country. Instead of building drones from kits, Reuter and others like him are turning to off-the-shelf models that are ready to fly. "Recently some of the sophisticated capabilities have gotten cheap and easy to use," he said. "The difference between the professional and hobbyist tools isn't that big anymore -- that's part of the revolution." Since the FAA's 2007 warning not to use drones for commercial purposes, there's been some debate and confusion in the hobbyist community about what you can and can't do with aerial photography. So before you go out and strap a GoPro to a ready-made drone, here's what you need to know: Learn the rules Keep drones and other model aircraft less than 400 feet above the ground and make sure you're not within 3 miles of an airport or air traffic, per FAA guidelines. Also check your state law, as some states are more strict with trespassing laws. Flying over someone's land could be considered trespassing. While it's tempting to turn aerial drone photography into a business, beware that the FAA regulates commercial flights on a case-by-case basis. Only two commercial operations have been approved, and those are for exploratory flights in the Arctic. P.S. Before you take your drone to shoot footage on vacation, do your research first. UAV laws vary in each country. Join a club or find an instructor It's better to work with experienced flyers than to test the skies alone. "Find a community to learn with if you're going to be serious, like a drone group or through the Academy of Model Aeronautics," said Reuter. "They'll teach you how to be safe and prevent any accidents." Study different models and what they can do Toy drones, like the Blade Nano QX, are great introductory models for people learning how to fly, said Reuter. This model runs about $80 online. Moving up to mid-range models, consider UAVs that come fully assembled, such as 3D Robotics' Iris model, which runs $750. The company's CEO, Chris Anderson, pioneered one of the first online drone forums, DIY Drones. One of the more popular mid-range UAVs is DJI's Phantom series. This quadcopter, priced from $500 without a camera and $1,000 and up for a model with an attached GoPro, is geared toward folks interested in aerial photography. If you're looking for something smaller than the Phantom, check out Reuter's recent creation, the Pocket Drone. The multi-copter is lightweight and portable enough to fit in a backpack, he said. Start small Learn to fly a cheap toy drone before adding a camera. Once you know how to operate that, you can fly a larger model, advises Patrick McKay, a Colorado hobbyist who's been flying UAVs since 2011. "Don't invest too much initially, since you will inevitably crash a lot while learning." Keep practicing until you're comfortable Canadian photographer Brent Foster encourages newcomers to learn how to fly in manual mode first. That way if your GPS goes out, "it'll save you from a crash," said the former LA Times photojournalist who got hooked on flying UAVs two years ago. Knowing your gear and its limitations will be valuable for when you fly in new, sometimes unpredictable situations, several UAV hobbyists said. Video: How to get started flying UAVs Put safety first "Always think about what you might hit if your craft crashed on a given flight," said McKay, a Colorado hobbyist. "Don't fly over large crowds of people doing event photography unless you have a lot of experience and confidence in your equipment, and stay away from areas/altitudes where you could pose a collision risk to manned aircraft." Use online resources Online forums and Facebook groups are great place to learn more about the hobby. DIY Drones is a pioneer forum that continues to be active. Other online resources include Multi-Rotor Forums, the DJI Phantom Users Group on Facebook and tons of local radio-controlled flyer group sites. Have fun Once you have the rules, safety precautions and practice time under your belt, it's time to have fun. "I love flying in the mountains and zooming down mountainsides," said McKay. "It allows me to experience all the thrills of flight in spectacular locations with my body never leaving the ground."  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/23/tech/social-media/facebook-dinosaur-mascot/index.html	tech	Forget Godzilla: Facebook rolls out its own dinosaur - CNN.com	2014/05/23	Friday May 23 04:49:26 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- It's been a big week for dinosaurs. With "Godzilla" still rampaging at the box office, Facebook also rolled out some privacy changes along with a friendly blue dino to help explain them all. In addition to making settings for all new users default to "Friends Only," Facebook announced Thursday it will prompt existing users to review their privacy settings. Your new guide to the intricacies of controlling your personal info on the world's biggest social platform? A blue cartoon dinosaur with a snaggletooth, tapping away at a laptop that looks like some kind of Macbook. "Hi!" reads one of the new pop-up windows, presumably relaying the sentiments of the new Mesozoic spirit animal. "Sorry to interrupt. You haven't changed who can see your post lately, so we just wanted to make sure you're sharing this post with the right audience." Fair enough. It's part of an effort that Facebook has been undertaking for months to clarify and tighten privacy settings, something critics have dinged the site for in the past. But why a dinosaur? "Our team looked at a few different characters, saw the dinosaur, and just thought he was the friendliest and best choice," said Raylene Yung, an engineering manager on Facebook's privacy team. "Once we tried him out, we saw some great results and welcomed him to the team." Dubbed the "Zuckasaurus" by The New York Times in a nod to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the (thankfully) un-Barney-like creature joins an ever-growing pantheon of tech mascots. From TiVo's smiley, leggy TV guy to Google Android's android, there has been no shortage of cutesy characters introduced by Web and tech companies to reinforce brand identity or help set themselves apart from the masses. As a species, they've provoked a wide variety of reactions. Some, like Reddit's beloved Snoo, the Twitter bird and the early Web's Ask Jeeves butler invoke warm feelings among users. Even Twitter's "Fail Whale," which showed up years ago whenever the platform was over capacity, had its fans. Other mascots weren't so lucky. Clippy, Microsoft's talking paper clip, became one of the computing age's most mocked, if not reviled, characters. Early Windows users were forced to click him out of existence over and over again as he popped up to give advice of sometimes questionable value. Plus, he's a talking paper clip. Kind of creepy. Then-CEO Bill Gates retired Clippy in 2001, though he was brought back in 2011 for a Microsoft Office tutorial -- but only if users chose him. Then there was the Pets.com sock puppet. Amusing enough at first, the puppet's schtick had already started getting old by 2001, when the site went belly up, its once-ballyhooed stock worth a whopping 22 cents a share. Will Facebook's privacy dino catch on? Or will he (or she) be mocked into extinction? Only time will tell. On Twitter, some users Friday were calling the creature a "safeasaur" or a "privasaurus." The New York Times said the Zuckasaurus "could suffer the cruel fate of other tech industry cartoon characters if Facebook slips on its promise to be more mindful of users' privacy." Meanwhile, we'll just be thankful it's not purple.

Got a question about etiquette in the digital world? Contact them at netiquette@cnn.com. (CNN) -- In the wise words of Joshua Ferris, "Then We Came to the End." We're rapidly approaching the close of 2012 and the technical end of autumn. And of course, according to (pseudo-scholars of) the Mayan calendar, we're a mere week away from The End of the World. All that finality got us thinking about how folks really manage to lose their netiquette heads when they scramble, legs flailing and akimbo, toward the denouement of events and life chapters. So here is the ultimate (get it?) guide to a polite big finish. If you're leaving your job ... Generally, it's wise to wait until your last day or so to let the LOLcat out of the bag (which is to say, to tweet or blog or otherwise post about your new gig). Why? Because until the ink has dried on your contract, you don't want to run your mouth and risk sharing an update your new company wanted to announce itself. Plus, your current employer might not want to be hit with a torrent of resumes. Remember to give your professional contacts your new e-mail address before your account is shut down. Then social-media up a storm on your first day or after your first week gushing about how much you love your new gig. Just don't do it during business hours. Obviously. If you're leaving a city ... The most heartfelt farewells will happen in person, but you do need to let your more casual acquaintances know about the relocation. A mass e-mail is wise, as are a few Paul Revere-esque "Moving day is coming! Moving day is coming!" updates on your social networking site of choice. But brace yourself: You'll likely continue to receive mass digital invites to events and debauchery in your former city from well-meaning but clueless contacts. Calmly write back to the inviter, explain that you won't be attending because you're flipping 2,000 miles away, and ask to be taken off the attendant chain of e-mails/texts/Facebook messages. If your company goes kaput ... The unemployment rate may have ticked down, but bankruptcies and shut-downs are still rampant (co-columnist Andi's magazine, "Martha Stewart's Whole Living," was shuttered on Friday, in fact). Stay classy to aid your job search and keep the bridges behind you unburned. Wait until the employer has made official statements to the press (don't blow the lid off the thing sooner), and then use whatever outlets you have to spread the word that you're back on the market. (Hi there!) (Hey, we couldn't very well call ourselves Netiquette experts if we weren't big on the Art of Self-Promotion, right?) If you're leaving your wife ... Digital missives should not, we repeat, should not be involved in the actual dumping. It's an obvious warning that more than a third of adults bewilderingly ignore. Suck it up and place a phone call or discuss it in person. Then let your close friends or parents or whomever know about the break-up (we recommend using e-mail or the phone) before you go switching up your relationship status on Facebook (or worse, creating an online dating profile). You don't want your loved ones to call you in alarm after a stalk-y friend alerts them to your new Single status, do you? If you're hanging up your hat as Netiquette columnists ... You take a bow and move on. These last 2.5+ years (and 130+ columns) have been real, and we're legit grateful to the readers and fans who responded with balanced criticism, intelligent questions and positive feedback. We've enjoyed mouthing off and calling out netiquette breaches as we saw 'em, and hope you've picked up a pointer or two. But we're moving on with our writing lives -- Brenna with a YA novel, Andi with a screenplay -- and we thought it wise to tap out before the world comes to a smoldering end. And to all the haters: Good luck with your lives as well as basic motor tasks. You desperately need it. -- Andi & Brenna  
http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/28/tech/mobile/netiquette-eight-phone-habits/index.html	tech	10 smartphone habits you should avoid - CNN.com	2012/09/28	Friday Sep 28 10:54:50 EDT 2012	Editor's note: Brenna Ehrlich and Andrea Bartz are the sarcastic brains behind humor blog and book "Stuff Hipsters Hate." Got a question about etiquette in the digital world? Contact them at netiquette@cnn.com. (CNN) -- We begin this week's column with a stunningly beautiful quote from Anais Nin (brought to our attention by the inimitable site Brainpickings). Read it slowly because it's that good. (Yes, we're enculturating you in Netiquette. We can hear the shouty, complainy e-mails already.) "The secret of a full life is to live and relate to others as if they might not be there tomorrow, as if you might not be there tomorrow. ... This thought has made me more and more attentive to all encounters, meetings, introductions, which might contain the seed of depth that might be carelessly overlooked. "This feeling has become a rarity, and rarer every day now that we have reached a hastier and more superficial rhythm, now that we believe we are in touch with a greater amount of people, more people, more countries. This is the illusion which might cheat us of being in touch deeply with the one breathing next to us. The dangerous time when mechanical voices, radios, telephones, take the place of human intimacies, and the concept of being in touch with millions brings a greater and greater poverty in intimacy and human vision." Nin wrote those words in 1946, but she might as well have been writing them today. She starts with a YOLO and ends with a contemporary-sounding rumination of just how horrible we've all become now that we hold the power to be in touch with millions of people in the palms of our hands. That's right, we're talking about how annoying and rude and antisocial we've all become with our smartphones and tablets. As CNN investigates all the ways mobile devices are changing our lives, we'd like to peel our eyes off our glowing screens long enough to recount our top eight egregious handheld errors. These are things you literally could not do before the www went mobile; now we're embarrassing ourselves all over the place. Please stop: 1. Drunk -tweeting, -texting, -Instagramming, etc. Long gone are the days when the only witnesses to your inebriated ramblings were other bar patrons who also saw you stumble from your bar stool to the ground. Whether you're able to keep it together with spelling and syntax (in which case, you've just got the world going, "Wait, she wants to do WHAT to Paul Ryan?!"), or your typing skills erode quickly, alcohol and mobile devices don't mix. 2. Fooling around on your phone whenever you have a spare moment. As writer Austin Kleon writes in his alarmingly cute book, "Steal Like an Artist," we need unstructured time for creativity to foster, down time in which we mess around and let our disconnected thoughts gel into cool ideas. If you turn every spare moment (a red light, a line at the salad station, a ride in the elevator) into an excuse to check your Cinemagram feed, you just won't have those artistic a ha! moments. (And no, "Draw Something" doesn't count.) 3. Passive-aggressively whining for the whole world to see. Look, we all have our personal stock of First World Problems, frustrated complaints with the minor injustices committed by a cruel, uncaring world. That's been true since the dawn of time. Now we just have myriad means of expressing them. Nobody cares about your thinly veiled railings against your ex or roommate or employer, OK? Unless you've scribbled it on a notepad, in which case you should share it with the world. So that we can laugh at you. 4. Being really, really scared to actually use the phone. Phones and tablets have made it oh so easy to communicate without using our voiceboxes. This is bad for relationships for oh so many reasons. Anais Nin would just hate it. Hit "dial" and enjoy the time-honored pas de deux of two humans, you know, talking. 5. Missing your favorite band's concert because you're so busy taking crappy photos, letting your phone ring and fiddling with your phone during the set. Your hard-of-hearing, reformed punk-rock uncle was right: Concerts really WERE better back in the day, not necessarily because music really meant something, man, but because the audience actually paid attention and sang along and danced instead of holding their phones in the air and spending 30-plus seconds trying to find the shutter button on the front of the screen. Your punkle would be so disappointed if he still made it out to shows today. 6. Texting salacious pictures. The ritual sharing of NC-17 photos used to be a complicated analog affair involving Polaroids and furtive looks. Nowadays, people just drop trou, snap and send. Analyze THAT, Anais Nin. 7. Turning your friends into enemies with videos of them. Camcorders have become tiny and discreet and as user-friendly as checking your e-mail. This is potentially bad news for those people you hang out with, as you hold in your hands a recording device that can humiliate them forever. Set ground rules and roll the camera judiciously, lest you wind up publicly shaming a friend for her foul mouth, caught-on-film fart or unpopular political opinions. 8. Letting your seething anger leach out into the world at large. Humans have always done stupid things when they're emotionally riled up. Now, those tantrums and rages and outbursts are shared and cached for the world to see. Take a deep breath and put down the smartphone. 9. Texting while walking. Rarely does this go well. Whatever's so urgent can probably wait a few minutes. Or you can, you know, actually call the person (see No. 4). 10. Using your phone in the bathroom. Don't. Just don't.  
http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/22/tech/web/netiquette-terrible-texts/index.html	tech	Netiquette: Five texts you should never send - CNN.com	2012/08/22	Wednesday Aug 22 08:43:36 EDT 2012	Editor's note: Brenna Ehrlich and Andrea Bartz are the sarcastic brains behind humor blog and book "Stuff Hipsters Hate." Got a question about etiquette in the digital world? Contact them at netiquette@cnn.com. (CNN) -- We're texting more than ever, and, like society, the texts themselves are getting worse and worse. That's a conclusion cobbled together from the Pew Internet and American Life Project, which found that the median number of texts adults send and receive in a day doubled from 2009 to 2010, and much anecdotal observation from the authors. Read on to learn just how terrible silent cell phone users are these days, and the five texts that should never traverse that satellite-banked arc from your hands to the eyes of another. 1. "I think we should see other people."  It isn't just skittish teenagers pulling this rude move. Last year, a survey from Lab 42 found that 33% of adults (adults!) had broken up with someone via text, e-mail or Facebook. Forty percent said they "would ever" do it, indicating that 7% of the surveyed humans are soulless jerks who haven't but would hurtfully sever ties with a lover if only someone would respond to their advances. Yes, breaking up is hard. Knowing you're going to hurt someone you cared about with your words indeed makes your stomach do some Cirque de Soleil-esque acrobatics. But shooting over a one-way missive to deliver the news for you? It's supremely cruel, because it leaves the other person cocking his or her head with Fred Willard-esque histrionics and asking, "Hey, wha' happened?" That complete lack of closure (not to mention the dearth of soothing, I-care-about-you-as-a-human-being signals you send with your voice and motions) add up to WAY more ruminating than is necessary. Netiquette: Be careful when diagnosing your ailments online  The break-up text is only this much more noble than ghosting on someone you're dating, letting the silences grow longer and longer until you can tell yourself it was a mutual separation and then scuttle into the night like a cowardly cockroach. If you went on enough dates to call this person your boyfriend or girlfriend, he or she deserves at least a call. 2. "Will you marry me?" A text proposal. It actually happened, people. And if that isn't innards-wrenchingly horrific enough, after it happened, Miss Manners went on to condone it. Can we please consider marriage proposals one of the few remaining bastions of old-fashioned romance, free from the lackadaisical pall that technology has cast over everything? Unless you've rigged some clever feat that ties in the nerdy way you met, your phone should be put away, your knee should be on the pavement, and your hands should be clutching a ring, not picking a ringtone. 3. "We're thinking about going to Shortstop later but Aiden is still napping & Mona was talking abt having ppl over for a cookout. IDK if I want to be out in the heat tho since I'm still hungo from Bosco's pirate party thing last night. Are you and Weeds still... [1 of 2]" 4. "...wandering around the park or did you want to do something later? Hit me up if you see this before 10. Gonna go pass out for a while. [2 of 2]" Texting was supposed to save us time by letting us bypass the phone call and just instantly telegraph the important stuff. But we've grown so reliant upon it that we obliviously miss, Mr. Bean-like, the conversations that could happen expeditiously over the phone. Netiquette: An open letter to texting-crazed teens So often, we put our thumbs to work typing out long and convoluted messages that warrant a detailed, meticulous volley of responses, when wagging our tongues would have cleared things up in 30 seconds flat. More than half of texters have "long, personal text message exchanges," according to a 2010 survey. They are all wasting time. Our rule of (red, raw, overused) thumb: If your text is longer than two sentences and it demands a response other than a simple yes or no, just hit Call. You'll save everyone a little time and a lot of confusion. 5. [a photo of your junk] According to a Pew Research Center study that is (according to the Times) due out later this year, 6% of American adults -- that's one in 17 upstanding citizens -- has sent a nude or nearly nude (but not "never-nude") photo on a cell phone. And 15% have received such a text. (Apparently these self-portraitists are prolific.) Leave something to the imagination, folks. Netiquette: Five ways to annoy people on Twitter   
http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/01/tech/netiquette-open-letter-teenagers/index.html	tech	An open letter to texting-crazed teens - CNN.com	2012/08/01	Wednesday Aug 1 10:48:22 EDT 2012	Editor's note: Editor's note: Brenna Ehrlich and Andrea Bartz are the sarcastic brains behind humor blog and book "Stuff Hipsters Hate." Got a question about etiquette in the digital world? Contact them at netiquette@cnn.com. (CNN) -- Young people of America: We get it. You're coming of age having never known an Internet-free existence. You'll never know what it's like to phone a friend at 10:01 p.m. and politely ask if it's too late to call, or to bike to a neighbor's and ring his doorbell with no preconceived notions of his whereabouts. You won't understand what it's like to have to yell for your dad to come to the basement to settle the argument over whether a loofah is an animal or a plant or whether one could, in theory, set one's farts on fire. The humor of the scene in "Clueless" where Cher and Dionne find each other in the high school hallway, mid-cell phone conversation, is probably lost on you. You haven't even seen "Clueless." We understand. While we can't really imagine our adolescence playing out so heavily on pixelated screens, we're able to sympathize. That's why our pleas to you come from a place of wisdom and concern, not of outdated notions or clinging vice-like to the past. Really, we older humans (fully aware that you find 93% of us very to extremely annoying) just don't want you to miss out on the vivid colors and poignant moments and slow-burn stories of the next seven decades of your existence. (That, and we're terrified you're going to make us obsolete as soon as you hit the job market.) With that place of loving care in mind, we give you our pleas. Stop sexting By its broadest definition -- sending explicit texts -- about half of 18- to 24-year-olds are doing it, according to recent research from the University of Michigan. And 28% of teenagers are texting fully nude photos of themselves, according to another new report. But, to quote every mother of a teenager ever, "If everyone else jumped off a bridge, would you do it, too?" Seriously, those 28% of people are dumb. They're risking public humiliation should they later realize they want to own a company or run for office (cough, cough, way too many male politicos, cough), and what's more, their digital dalliances may meet the legal definition of child pornography. Plus, anyone (teachers, parents, principals) nearby can read a new text when it pops up on your smartphone -- how mortified will you be when your boyfriend leaves his phone on the kitchen counter? Play it safe and text in sweet-sounding code words only. Stop texting so much In 2010, the average teen was sending more than 3,000 texts a month, according to a study from Nielsen. Three. Thousand. That's 3,000 moments when you've got your head ducked away from your surroundings, fingers flailing, tongue protruding from the lower right side of your mouth ever so slightly, sending someone an obviously inane missive when you could be just interacting with the people (or nature or cityscape or whatever) around you. It may feel natural, but when you're around anyone over 25, in particular, it comes off as very, very rude. Nobody enjoys being put on hold while the person 3 feet away from him or her taps all over a screen. And when the tapping goes on for hours on a 45-second loop, in response to every ding of a response? We promise, if you text your friend back just once to say you can't talk right now, no one will spontaneously implode. If anything, your bud's call-used finger pads will appreciate the much-needed break. Get over your fear of the phone Our parents couldn't believe how much time we spent on the phone in the early 2000s, lounging on pink carpet and twirling the phone's cord while parsing exactly what Darren meant by writing his and Janice's initials as the points on the vector on the chalkboard in geometry class. It probably seemed like a colossal waste of time, moments we should have spent doing homework while wearing our dental headgear or something. But voice-to-voice communication is becoming a lost art, and that's kind of a huge bummer. Nowadays, just 14% of teens say they talk daily with friends on a landline, down from 30% in 2009. And 31% of teens say they never talk on a landline with friends. Similarly, 26% of teens say they talk daily with friends on their cell phone, down from 38% of teens in 2009, according to the Pew Research Center. (And, yes, the amount of time that adults spend on the phone overall is probably declining too, thanks to wondrous inventions such as Seamless and ZocDoc that prevent us from actually having to deal with other human beings. But these are teens -- gabby, detail-obsessed beings with the intricate social structure of a clan of bonobos, who can spend seven hours together at school and still find material to cover in a four-hour phone conversation in the evening.) As we've said before, the phone offers unparalleled access to the thoughts and feelings of the person on the other end of the line. Only over the phone can you pick up on nuance, soothe a spurned friend appropriately and really get to the heart of why that beezy Jocelyn asked Greg to Turnabout when everyone knew you were planning to. We also worry that your not using the phone means you're going to be jerks when you get into the office world, adding to our bursting inboxes instead of picking up the damn phone every now and then. Our end goals may be selfish, but we want the best for everyone. Even ADD-addled, lightning-fingered, know-it-all you.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/21/tech/innovation/would-you-live-in-a-house-made-of-urine-and-bacteria/index.html	tech	Would you live in a house made of sand and bacteria? - CNN.com	2014/05/21	Wednesday May 21 11:32:54 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Peter Trimble found his formula through trial and error. A design student at the University of Edinburgh, he was aiming to produce an artistic exhibition for a module on sustainability, when he stumbled on "Dupe," a living alternative to concrete. A lab technician introduced Trimble to Sporosarcina pasteurii, a bacterium with binding qualities, sometimes used to solidify soil to hold road signs in place. The student tested it with one of the world's most abundant resources - sand. Pumping bacterial solution into a sand-filled mould, he added nutrients, urea derived from urine as fertilizer and calcium. After a year, and hundreds of failed experiments, this process manufactured a stool around 70% the compression strength of concrete. The process requires less than one-sixth of the energy used in concrete production, and is completely biodegradable. Crucially, Trimble believes his mechanism has the added benefit that it could be employed by anyone, anywhere. "Once you have the basic framework it should be transferable. Imagine a Tsunami-hit farm in Indonesia that is not getting supplies. You could use sand and bacteria on site, practically free, and have shelter housing that is far more permanent." Trimble is working with NGOs to apply Dupe to Aboriginal settlements and insecure regions of Morocco. But while the applications are new and experimental, the concept of growing the material for our built environment is increasingly regarded as not merely interesting, but essential. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the construction industry accounts for 40% of the world's C02 emissions, 40% of U.S. landfill and has been uniquely resistant to change. Concrete, bricks and cement have remained the dominant materials since the industrial revolution in the early 19th century, and as pressure mounts on resources and climate, scientists and architects are looking to the natural world for solutions. Building bacteria Bacteria have been at the center of alternative methods. North Carolina start-up Biomason is growing bricks on an industrial scale, cultivated from sand by microorganisms. The company has won major prizes and funding for the bricks, which will be used in a structure for the first time this year in a pedestrian walkway, ahead of building projects across the world. Similar processes are being developed to build in the most challenging environments. British architects see an opportunity to cultivate new life in deserts, while NASA believe bacteria could allow the construction of bases on other planets without the headache of ferrying the material there. While bacterial processes save heavily on carbon, there are concerns that by-products could be poisonous. But another living brick -- made from mushrooms -- has no such problems. Functional fungus  New York firm Ecovative are producing materials that combine agricultural waste products such as corn stock with mushroom mycelium -- the roots of the vegetable. Over five days the mycelium binds the waste to create a block with a stronger compressive strength than concrete, with none of the heat or energy required by regular bricks. The product is in commercial use for packaging, producing thousands of units a month, and the company is expanding into construction. Ecovative believe that in addition to being renewable and decomposable, natural properties give them a performance advantage. "It has great insulation properties", says Sam Harrington, Ecovative Director of Sustainability. "A key benefit is flame resistance -- without adding any chemicals we were able to achieve a Class A fire rating". There is scope for development. Mycelium effectively dies once its growth is complete, but Harrington is looking ahead to material that does not. "We are exploring ideas of living materials, perhaps that are self-healing or respond to leaks with indicators." Ecovative are in dialogue with major construction companies, and the material will soon be tested on a historic scale. A collaboration with architects The Living won the prestigious MOMA (Museum of Modern Art) PS-1 competition, and their creation will be installed in the museum courtyard this summer. Growing for gold "Hy-Fi" will be the largest ever grown structure, and first large building to claim zero carbon emissions. It will be formed of three 40-foot spiral towers constructed from the mushroom material, with varying properties of brick to maximise light and ventilation. The material's versatility offers unique design opportunities, says David Benjamin, lead architect of the project. "You can dial in almost any performance you want. You can mix and match a variety of properties such as water resistance or UV resistance, lightness or durability. You can grow the bricks in almost any shape" Benjamin says the bio-bricks could be made to last as long as traditional materials, but believes architecture must embrace temporary structures. "It's essential to recognize that not all materials should last for centuries. A lot of the steel in our buildings will last longer than we need. Our idea is a building that be made locally and quickly, and then have a plan for when the life of the building is over." Future applications would include pop-up stores, festival "tents" and emergency shelters, says Benjamin, but there are greater hopes for the material within the industry. Stronger than concrete "I could imagine every structure you would built out of bricks", says Dirk Hebel, Assistant Professor of Architecture and Construction at the Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore. "No high-rises, but smaller scale structures and houses. The material is stronger than concrete, with better insulation capacities". The challenge will come in commercializing the products, Hebel feels. "There is huge demand for alternative materials. The question is how easy it is to penetrate the existing market. This needs time and a couple of buildings to show the possibilities". Stealing from nature Another, more radical approach takes the material from nature but also allows it to build the structure. Michael Pawlyn, director of Exploration Architecture, is a leading figure in biomimicry, having previously applied natural processes to create man-made forests in England and the Sahara Desert. His latest project to grow a "small venue for spoken word performances" from undersea biorock was recently unveiled at the Architecture Foundation in London. "In biology, complex structures achieve resource efficiency by putting things in exactly the right place, which is very difficult with made materials", says Pawlyn. "Our ways should deliver significant resource savings." Drawing on the natural accumulation of coral reefs, his team would install a steel frame in the deep ocean and leave it to attract material. Growth would be focused on specific areas of need using an electrical current. "We're interested in looking at its structural growth patterns. We have stress gauges on the structure to measure force in particular areas. If one is highly stressed, we can input more current so the rate of deposition matches the force." Pawlyn believes the structure could be built within two years, for consideration at scale. As with Ecovative, a key challenge ahead is to integrate still-living material to allow intelligent biosensors that respond to the building occupants. Innovators in this space acknowledge the ongoing barriers presented in an industry that has resisted modernization. But from rock to fungus, sand to space dust, the use of materials and processes designed by nature herself offer both a solution to the sustainability crisis, and a glimpse of our new built environment: clean, efficient, and alive.

Gauteng, South Africa (CNN) -- "I was in a position to see exactly what happens in the human hand. I got the basics of what it's all about and thought yeah, I'll make my own." Richard van As is recalling the moment in May 2011 when he sat in a Johannesburg hospital waiting to hear if his fingers could be stitched back on. Just an hour earlier, he had been in his carpentry workshop sawing wood when the saw slipped and ripped diagonally through the four fingers on his right hand. "It all happened too quickly to know what actually happened," he remembers. Rather than fear the outcome, or dwell on the repercussions of losing his fingers, he was already thinking of ways to fix the problem, like a true carpenter. After days of scouring the Internet he couldn't find anywhere to buy a functional prosthetic finger and he was astonished at the cost of prosthetic hands and limbs which began in the tens of thousands of dollars. But his online surfing paid off as it brought him to an amateur video posted by a mechanical effects artist in Washington State, by the name of Ivan Owen. Together, the pair developed a mechanical finger for van As, but their partnership has also gone on to benefit countless hand and arm amputees around the globe, through the birth of the company "Robohand." Officially launched in January 2012, Robohand creates affordable mechanical prosthetics through the use of 3D printers. Not only that, but it has made its designs open source, so that anyone with access to such printers can print out fingers, hands and now arms as well. Printing prosthetics Using the process of additive manufacture, the specialized printers use the thermoplastic material Polylactide (PLA) to print body parts such as knuckles and joints, which when combined with stainless steel and aluminum produce a personalized prosthetic which customers can assemble and fit themselves courtesy of a free open-source manual available to them. "Within five minutes of getting it fitted, people can actually use it," explains Leonard Nel, the communications manager in the team. "It's anatomically driven by the wrist, elbow, or shoulder once fitted," he adds -- meaning its movements are controlled by the user. The first Robohand ever created was made for five-year-old Liam, from South Africa, who was born with amniotic band syndrome (ABS), which left him with no fingers on his right hand. Within minutes of fitting his newly printed mechanical hand Liam beamed excitedly and expressed how he could now "pick up stuff," describing its movement by saying: "it copies me." "They all have their special moment," says Nel. Read: 3-D printed arm gives hope to boy maimed by bomb Van As drives the whole process on simplicity, voicing his desire to remove unnecessary red tape and cost when providing people with something as essential as a limb. A full adult hand costs as little as $2,000, takes five and a half hours to print and approximately 10-15 hours to assemble. Ordering a prosthetic is also quite simple. Customers are sent measurement forms to complete and send those in combination with 3-D scans of their hands for translation into the software, which will print out the parts for their desired prosthetic. Where 3-D scans aren't feasible, hard molds can instead be made and shipped to the team in South Africa. The simplicity of the ordering process has led to demand outstripping what Robohand can supply, with requests for limbs coming from almost every country around the globe. There is now an eight-month waiting list when orders are placed. "I know of only three countries that haven't had a hand yet," says van As. "To make sure everyone can have access we essentially steal from the rich and give to the poor. Those who can afford it pay, and those that can't we find a way for someone to pay it for them." Because Robohand's manuals and 3-D printable files are available online, others are also using its designs to print prosthetics. "We stopped counting at 200 hands that were made back in November 2013," says van As. "But we can see there have now been over 143,000 downloads of the software. People all over the world are doing this without us. We don't even know of them all." Paying it forward The majority of its customers are in the United States, where most customers can afford its relatively low prices, so van As is able to subsidize prosthetics for those who are more disadvantaged. "We had Dylan Laas in L.A. who received a Robohand and when his dad saw the impact he paid for Waldo, another person on our waiting list, to receive one as well," says van As. Waldo was also born with ABS, like Liam, leaving him no fingers on his right hand, and van As was able to fit him with a working hand too. "It's all about paying it forward as people want to help," says van As. Robohand is growing and the team plans on expanding past the fingers and arms currently on offer. "Our next step is to print whole legs for people to use and walk on," explains van As. But it doesn't stop there. "Then if we make that work, the goal is entire exoskeletons, for paraplegics to be able to walk again." Read: Robot exoskeleton lets girl lift her arms Read: Lungs on a chip and 3-D printed hearts  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/12/health/weight-loss-irpt-jonathon-walters/index.html	health	Weight loss success: 200 pounds down in 9 months - CNN.com	2014/05/12	Monday May 12 07:32:10 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Do you have a weight-loss success story to share? Tell us how you did it and you could be featured in our weekly weight-loss story on CNN.com. (CNN) -- Jonathon Walters didn't know where to begin. He just knew he had to start somewhere, or he wouldn't be alive for much longer. His weight had caused him problems for years. In high school, he was wearing size 50 pants. As a junior, sick of the bullies and comments from teachers, Walters went to his father and told him he was dropping out of school. He recalls his dad saying, "John, quitting is unlike anything else in life. It is only hard the first time you do it. After that it is habit and almost impossible to break." His dad was right. Walters received his high school diploma through home schooling in 2006. But in the years that followed, he quit college and multiple jobs. Now, though, the comic book colorist from Benton, Illinois, is finally sticking with something. His father's death motivated him to lose 200 pounds in the last nine months, and he says he isn't looking back. 'My world had collapsed' On May 6, 2013, Walters received devastating news: His father had died from a heart attack. He was 53. According to Walters, his father wasn't overweight or really out of shape, so his death was unexpected. "My world had collapsed," Walters said. Walters was despondent. He left his job as a telecommunications sales rep and didn't speak to practically anyone besides his wife and three young boys. Already heavy, Walters began packing on more weight in the weeks after his father died. He ate to numb the pain he felt, every night feeling the crushing weight laying heavy on his chest. "At first I played the role of the victim and slowly let my obsession with food consume me," he said. But then he had a realization about his father's death. It hit him that he too would "eventually run out of tomorrows." On July 18, he woke up and decided he had had enough. He was done. "I was done being a burden to my family. I was done feeling pain every second of every day. I was done being stared at in grocery stores. I was done being the regular customer at fast food restaurants. I was done being the unhealthy version of me. "I was done quitting everything I started. I was going to not only lose the weight, I was going to obliterate it. I was going to stop giving up. I quit quitting." Facing reality Walters made a doctor's appointment for the next day. He had no idea how he would do it, but he was determined to lose weight without surgery and knew he needed help. At the doctor's office, he had to sit in the bench-style chairs because he was too large to fit in the regular seats. Facing reality was hard. He weighed 477 pounds, had high blood pressure and high cholesterol, as well as a severe fatty liver. He left the doctor's office and started exercising the next day. "I could barely walk without getting winded. After every time I went walking, I could feel pain in my legs and feet. It hurt so bad to keep going, but I knew it was temporary and giving up was permanent." Walters would walk a quarter mile, then rest for 5 minutes. Slowly, he worked himself up to greater distances. Soon, he was up to 3 miles a day and was down 50 pounds. A few months later, he started running. Walters now runs 10 miles a day, lifts weights and works out on machines at the gym. He has completely changed his diet, lowering his carbohydrate intake, eating more vegetables and fruits, and increasing his protein consumption. He also cut out fried foods and soda. The 6'3" man currently weighs 270 pounds. He still wants to lose an additional 30 to 40 pounds, but at a much slower pace through weightlifting. He started a Facebook page to hold himself accountable and is inspired by all the messages he gets each day. Terri Hartman, a nurse practitioner who worked with Walters early on in his diet, said she's thrilled with his progress. Besides changing his own life, she's seen his lifestyle changes inspire others, including his two sisters, to become healthy. Walters has found new strength and willpower, Hartman says -- something that will aid him the rest of his life. This time, Walters is determined not to quit.   "It isn't about me anymore. My mission is to bring motivation to the masses and show them it doesn't take any surgeries, pills or other products," Walters said. "I have three boys and a wife that count on me daily. ... Imagining my sons and wife without me, makes every ounce of effort I put in worth it." He lost 125 pounds, but still felt fat Random online match helps man lose nearly 400 pounds  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/05/health/weight-loss-janetzko/index.html	health	He lost 125 pounds, but still felt fat - CNN.com	2014/05/05	Monday May 5 09:20:46 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Do you have a weight-loss success story to share? Tell us how you did it and you could be featured in our weekly weight-loss story on CNN.com. (CNN) -- If you're overweight, slimming down will make you feel great, right? For John Janetzko, embracing his own body took more than just weight loss. The 24-year-old chemistry Ph.D. candidate at Harvard is just under 6 feet tall, and struggled with his body image for years. Even after losing 125 pounds, he still felt fat, and pushed himself in unhealthy ways in terms of diet and fitness. These days, at a lean 165 pounds, Janetzko feels more confident and generally better about himself. "I feel more generically attractive in terms of what society's views are," he said. "But I guess I also feel like that was something I thought would be very quick, and would sort of happen right away." Getting motivated In childhood, Janetzko heard from his pediatrician that his weight wasn't healthy so many times that he became desensitized to it. But as his father remembers it, he wasn't ever really fat. Intense studying and bad eating habits piled on pounds during college. By the fall of junior year, Janetzko weighed about 290 pounds. "I would always be sort of afraid of how I thought people would think of me," he said. "I always expected my girlfriend at the time would find someone better." The first stage of Janetzko's weight loss came when he lived at home in Toronto during college. A friend encouraged Janetzko to go to the gym with him, even offering to buy him running shoes. Janetzko started going to the gym often, focusing on jogging and light weights. Instead of greasy takeout meals from food stands, Janetzko started picking up leaner options such as grilled chicken and broccoli, and cooked more on weekends. His father helped cook when Janetzko was busy. "I started with the idea that being very strict with my diet was the solution," he said. During his senior year, with graduate school applications and his father becoming ill, Janetzko slipped, forgoing the gym because there weren't enough hours in the day. His weight fluctuated, never quite bouncing back as high as it was, but still reversing some of the progress he had made. The move from Toronto to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a breakup from a long relationship also distracted him from healthy eating. He was about 240 pounds when he entered Harvard. Graduate school jump-started his motivation again. He told himself: "I've had so many changes, and it's really time to have an absolute fresh start." How he did it During the summer of 2011, Janetzko went to the gym consistently and cooked at least four nights a week. He had in his head a "running clock" of calorie and protein limits for meal times, aiming for about 2,000 calories a day. Breakfast was usually a protein shake. Lunch would be salad, sandwich or burrito. Dinner would be around 1,000 calories. By the end of autumn of his first year at Harvard, he was closer to 200 pounds. On a visit home to Toronto, he ran his first 5K race, which motivated him to keep working on his fitness. Janetzko also encouraged his roommates to go with him to exercise, and helped friends with their workouts and stretches. "I guess that was a point where I was sort of feeling happy," he said. Focused on fitness, he competed in volleyball leagues, swam, and played squash and soccer. By mid-2012, he was down to 170 pounds. Losing those last 60 to 70 pounds in Massachusetts brought about the most substantial physical changes in his fitness journey. "I said, 'What happened to you? Are they not feeding you?' " his father, Rainer Janetzko, remembers telling his son when he first visited after the weight loss. Generally, though, Janetzko's new physique looks good, his father said. "Now when he puts a suit on, he looks better." Going too far Slim and athletic as he was, Janetzko still didn't feel good about how he looked in May 2012. It was an awkward time he calls the "transition" -- when he had lost a lot of weight, but his new body didn't register in his mind as a positive image. "I would wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and feel like 'Oh God, I'm fat and ugly and this is terrible,' " he said. At the same time, others told him he had gotten too skinny and didn't need to get thinner. Objectively, he had reached his goal -- but he couldn't see that in his reflection. He thought his mirror image still needed to lose 10 or 20 more pounds. Focused on weight loss and fitness, Janetzko didn't pay close attention to his body's signals that it was being pushed too hard. As he ate less and started running farther and faster, Janetzko noticed he would start to get dizzy or even fall. Last semester he collapsed outside of a laboratory. "That was a scary time for a lot of people -- my lab mates, my advisor and myself included," he said. "If you don't balance your diet properly (you) can't go and work yourself really hard." His aversion to overeating had gone too far -- his appetite for some foods had diminished. Friends even wondered if he had an eating disorder. "There were days when I could barely finish half a sandwich," he said. "I felt full but I clearly had not taken in all of the calories I need as a functioning person." He has since gone to nutritionists for help. He isn't as rigid about what he eats anymore, and is more flexible about his workouts. He still minimizes fried foods but tries to be more varied with meals. The Cut: What no one tells you about losing lots of weight Embracing a new self Body image disturbance isn't unusual when people lose weight, said Emily Sandoz, assistant professor of psychology at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Often people have huge expectations about the life changes that will result from a weight loss that don't actually happen. "Their experience of themselves as fat extends far beyond their actual body," she said. "People have to learn how to be in their skin in a new way." Sandoz's approach to helping people with body image problems is to shift the focus to other areas of their lives that they care about, such as work or parenting. Mindfulness -- the idea of being present and in the moment -- is incorporated in her approach to helping clients be more accepting of their bodies. Can mindfulness help manage pain and mental illness? Over time, Janetzko has been able to reconcile his weight with his body image -- but there was no one moment where it suddenly clicked. Positive reinforcement from others and self-assurance have helped him feel better about himself. His message to others Many of Janetzko's old friends who see his recent photos on Facebook have contacted him to ask: "How did you do it?" Janetzko's bottom line is that he was intensely motivated. "If you count your calories and you're like, 'I want to lose weight,' you're going to be stuck in that forever," he said. "But I think if you can make changes in your lifestyle that you actually want to be doing, and then you'll do those no matter what -- you enjoy them -- then you never have to feel like you're trapped in a routine."

Tell us how you did it and you could be featured in our weekly weight-loss story on CNN.com. (CNN) -- At the last minute, Morgan Victoria's friend convinced her to attend their 10-year high school reunion. Victoria hadn't had any intention of going to "such a silly thing," but her friend's significant other couldn't make it and, well, peer pressure doesn't end at 18. Victoria balked as the former class president handed her a name tag. On it was Victoria's senior photo. Walking around the event, something inside of her snapped. "I'm wearing a picture of me 10 years younger and 100 pounds lighter," Victoria remembers. "It was humiliating." "The next day I was like, 'That's it.' " At the August 2012 reunion, Victoria weighed 255 pounds and wore a size 18 dress. Over the next nine months, she lost more than 100 pounds by moving more and eating less. "There is no secret," Victoria says about weight loss. "All you have to do is care. If you honestly care about yourself, if you honestly care about getting it done -- that's all you have to do." Victoria didn't grow up overweight, though she sometimes felt like it in her athletic family. Her parents cooked healthy meals around the house, and Victoria swam, played tennis and ran cross country until she left for college. At the Savannah College of Art and Design in Georgia, where she majored in communication arts (otherwise known as comic books and poetry, she jokes), she ate whatever she wanted. That included plenty of junk food. "You eat the cheap stuff," Victoria remembers. "It wasn't like I was getting home from the studio and being like, 'I need some lean protein and vegetables.' " When she graduated and struggled to find work, she ate even worse. Though she lived in Savannah, Georgia, a walking city, she never went to the gym and couldn't combat the excess calories she was consuming. At 5' 8", her body mass index was 38. (Over 30 is considered obese.) In 2011, Victoria married Lyndsay Rosenlund in a small private ceremony with family and friends in Washington state. The couple moved to Atlanta and started going out for dinner frequently with friends. But the day after her high school reunion, Victoria went into the pantry of their home and got rid of anything with more than a few ingredients on the label. She read about serving sizes and started using an app to count calories. She even bought a food scale. "Honestly, all of it was kind of hard," Victoria says. "At 255 pounds, you don't actually want to do anything. ... Exercising was hard because I was embarrassed. Nobody wants to be the fat girl working out." So she stayed out of the gym, and started walking with Rosenlund and their dogs, Giuseppe and Romona. She walked for about an hour every morning and an hour every night. Eventually she gained enough confidence to jog. Now she runs 5Ks. "We tried running together when we first started our journey, but it turns out I hate running," Rosenlund says. "However, we both enjoy hiking so we try and hike every chance we get." The couple also tried to limit how often they ate out. When they did go to a restaurant, they made a game plan and made smarter choices. Water instead of beer. Balsamic vinaigrette instead of ranch dressing. Victoria swears she never goes hungry. She relies on big salads, air-popped corn and lean protein to keep her full without a lot of calories. With these simple strategies, she lost about 2 pounds a week. Rosenlund also lost 50 pounds. Victoria now wears a size 6 and has maintained her final weight of 150 pounds for nearly a year. "Morgan has a lot more energy and less anxiety," Rosenlund says. "I think that the weight loss has definitely improved her outlook on life." "I feel amazing," Victoria agrees. "You feel totally different about yourself. You shouldn't feel all that from weight, but you do."  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/17/health/hrw-children-tobacco-workers-report/index.html	health	Kids working on tobacco farms experience nicotine poisoning - CNN.com	2014/05/17	Saturday May 17 07:21:21 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Jessica Rodriguez was 11 years old when she first stepped onto a tobacco field in Snow Hill, North Carolina. She spent the next five summers working on a neighbor's tobacco farm, usually six days a week. "It was hard. It was definitely hard," she remembers. "We had a good boss lady -- she bought us lunch every day. But remember, you're sitting there eating lunch with tobacco gum all over your hands." Rodriguez had a lot to do, including hand-pulling tobacco and panning it with a harvester. She and the other children on the farm worked from 6 or 7 in the morning to 7 or 8 at night. "I got heat exhaustion -- vomiting, feel like my stomach was trying to come out of my body," she said. "They would bring me water and saltine crackers to settle my stomach until I got better and then back to work." It may not have been easy, she says, but the pay was was good. She earned anywhere from $100 to $150 a day; the money was given directly to her parents. Rodriguez's story has played out time and again on tobacco fields across the country for decades. A report published this week from Human Rights Watch details the dangers child workers face on America's tobacco farms. Report slams child labor in tobacco fields Called "Tobacco's Hidden Children: Hazardous Child Labor in US Tobacco Farming," the report documents conditions on farms in North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia. Ninety percent of all tobacco grown in this country comes from those four states. The researchers interviewed 141 child tobacco workers between the ages of 7 and 17 for the report. Nearly 75% reported a range of devastating symptoms, including vomiting, nausea, headache, dizziness, skin rashes and burning eyes. Many of the symptoms are consistent with acute nicotine poisoning, said Margaret Wurth, a children's rights researcher at Human Rights Watch and co-author of the report. It's often called green tobacco sickness, or GTS. GTS can happen when nicotine is absorbed through skin while handling tobacco plants. "About half the kids we interviewed said they saw tractors come through fields where they were working, or nearby fields, spraying pesticides," Wurth said. "And the children said they could smell and taste and feel the chemical spray as it drifted toward them." And nicotine is not the only danger. There were more than 1,800 non-fatal injuries to kids under 18 that worked on farms in 2012, according to the Human Rights Watch report. Two-thirds of the children who died from occupational injuries that year were agricultural workers. "We found that kids are working 10 or 12, sometimes 14-hour days in extreme heat," Wurth said. "They often have no place to go to the bathroom, no place to wash their hands at work and many of them are given no safety training, no health education and no protective equipment." The researchers found kids using sharp tools, such as axes or machetes, to dig up weeds and/or harvest tobacco. Some kids worked near dangerous machinery. Others climbed up into the rafters of barns, more than one story off the ground, to hang tobacco to dry without any kind of safety gear. The Human Rights Watch estimates several hundred thousand kids work in agriculture in the United States each year, but there are no hard numbers on just how many are working on tobacco farms, and no number to adequately portray the scope of the problem. Most, Wurth says, are the children of Hispanic immigrants. U.S. labor laws, she says, do not protect these kids. According to the report: -- Children as young as 12 can work unlimited hours on any size farm as long as they have a parent's permission. -- Children of any age can work in any job on a farm owned by their parents. -- There is no minimum age for children to work on small farms. -- At 16, children working on farms can do jobs considered hazardous by the Department of Labor. Children working outside agriculture must be at least 18 to do hazardous work. The Federal Youth Employment Laws in Farm Jobs, while setting standards for youth employment in agriculture, does not specifically address tobacco farms. But the Department of Labor released a statement addressing the Human Rights Watch report: "Our job at the Department of Labor is to ensure that agricultural employers keep their workers, regardless of age, safe on the job, housed in safe and sanitary residential facilities, and pay them their legally-required wages," the government agency said. "The Department especially takes seriously its role in ensuring that employers operate in compliance with all appropriate laws and rules with respect to young workers." Several "young workers" who spoke to CNN said a tobacco farm is not an appropriate place for a child. Mildre Lima, now 19, started working in the tobacco fields when she was 12. She came to Saratoga, North Carolina, from Florida with her parents, three brothers and her grandmother. They all harvested tobacco, receiving $7.25 an hour. It wasn't long before Lima started getting sick. Rashes turned her skin a dark color and caused it to peel off in patches. But that was just the beginning. The adults she worked with were mean to her, she says, and when she was 14 she was sexually harassed. "When (my mom) confronted the supervisor he fired us. He fired my mom, me and my grandmother." When she looks back on those years, Lima says no child should ever have to go through what she did. Her dad still works the tobacco fields, but last year was Lima's last. She is done. For most of these kids, the money -- the ability to help their families financially -- is the draw. Erick Garcia, 17, is one. He was 11 when he started harvesting tobacco in Kinston, North Carolina, with his parents and two older siblings. The teen says he worked from 7 a.m. to sundown with no breaks besides a lunch hour. Though he doesn't want to, Garcia plans to work the tobacco fields again this summer. "When you are surrounded by plants that are taller than you, you feel like you are suffocating," he says. But there are "no other options to do another job, a better job, that is not dangerous and hard." Jessica Rodriguez returned to the fields last summer when her other company cut her hours, and she was three to four months behind on every bill. Her sons Brandon, 15, and Fernando, 13, spent the summer in the tobacco fields for the first time alongside her. Both boys have medical issues: Brandon has asthma and ADHD; Fernando has a tumor on the bottom of his brain stem. Rodriguez is worried about their well-being in the fields. Still, her boys want the financial freedom of having their own money. Rodriguez herself is back to working full time elsewhere, and says she'll work with her sons in the fields this summer on her days off. But if Human Rights Watch has any say in the matter, children will not be allowed on tobacco farms at all. "We've concluded that any tasks where kids come into direct contact with tobacco plants or dried tobacco leaves pose hazards to their health," Wurth said. "We want companies to make clear that kids cannot work in jobs where they are exposed to these dangers and then to communicate this to the growers and their supply chains to make sure the growers know these rules and follow them." Human Rights Watch shared its report with 10 companies that buy tobacco grown in the United States. "Nine of the 10 companies responded and all are concerned about child labor, but none of them have policies that specifically protect children from the hazards we identified in our research," Wurth said. Jeff Caldwell, a spokesman for Altria Group, one of the largest tobacco companies in the country, told CNN the company doesn't employ its own farmers, and has strict standards for contractors it buys tobacco from. Altria Group is the parent of Philip Morris USA, which makes about half of all cigarettes sold in the United States. "Our tobacco companies do not condone the unlawful employment or exploitation of farm workers, especially those under the age of 18," Caldwell said. He said U.S. tobacco companies will work together on the issues outlined in the report. To Wurth, the solution is more complicated. "We can't let this be the only option for these families," she said. "We can't say these families are living in poverty, therefore it's OK ... We have to make sure that there are better opportunities for these kids, and that they're not forced to do this kind of work that makes them sick." CNN's Mariano Castillo contributed to this story.

In a 2010 iReport story, she shared learning to diaper her son with her feet. She is a motivational speaker and author of the book "In Capable Arms: Living a Life Embraced by Grace." (CNN) -- It was one of those days when I would have given anything to be someone else. We were at the park and I watched my 3-year-old son climb the slide's ladder. He crossed the balance beam and conquered the climbing wall, and I just stood there, trying to tell my fears to shut up. I knew that, if he were to fall, these arms could not catch him. I could only kiss away the tears I failed to save him from. I am a mother with upper limb differences, and this swallowing of fear is a daily effort on my part, since I've always felt a little less capable as a human being, and especially now as a mother. I was born with a disability called arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC), and it left my arms weak, shorter than average and stiff. This makes the most mundane tasks quite difficult sometimes, but I'm so grateful that AMC also left my hands hooked under -- it's with these "hooks" I am able to carry my children, at least for a few seconds here and there. As I watch my little boy flit from one obstacle to another, I remember the summer before I started kindergarten. I was playing at the park while my own mother watched from the shade. I didn't dare tackle the very tall slide, as ladders always scared me. I couldn't properly grip the rungs, and even at that young age, I understood that I had limits. Instead, I climbed the wide steps of the elephant-shaped slide, which was probably intended for children much younger than me. I reached the top and shoved off. From the first moment of my descent, I began to lose control. My body had turned sideways by the time I reached the bottom, and I fell onto the concrete landing, left arm first. The thing about arms affected by AMC is that they don't bend. They just break. My mom rushed me to the hospital for this, the first of the seven arm breaks of my childhood. Naturally, even now as an adult, I find it difficult to watch my son take physical risks without feeling a surge of panic. Without remembering the crunch of snapping bone. He, however, seems to live for anything that would terrify me. Often I force myself to turn away so he can earn his boyhood scrapes without this nervous mom swooping in. For disabled parents, challenges are bonding point For many things, I have to use my feet. I have to admit that toes are poor substitutes for fingers, and for every obstacle I've overcome, there are 10 that I haven't. Despite that, I drive a car. I change diapers. I've published a book and am a freelance journalist -- every word typed by toe. I travel all over the country to speak to schools, women's groups, churches. But the truth is, as my son laid on my chest moments after birth, I didn't know how I would manage to hold him. I didn't know how I'd work a car seat. I'd changed exactly one diaper, years before, and I'd never held an infant. I was in over my head. But my son and I adapted to each other quickly, so that within two weeks my husband went back to work and I was able to care for my new baby -- not without difficulty, but without help. Luckily, newborns are extremely patient (read: they can't move), so I was able to work on those things that were difficult, and take my time until it became a little more natural for me. But really, most of what I do throughout the day is struggle. I am in such awe as I watch how easily other moms pick up their toddlers. How easily someone turns the page of a book. How quickly other writers can type. Wow. What would that be like? Struggle has been the great theme of my 30 years. And for most of those years, I hated it. I would have given anything to be normal -- to be anyone other than me. I wanted to blend in. Who doesn't? I can't tell you the number of times I thought, whispered, growled under my breath, "WHY does everything have to be so freaking difficult for me?" After attempting to open a window. To button my pants. To strain pasta. But as I've become an adult, as I worked through so much pain in writing my memoir, I began to see that Struggle is not my enemy. In fact, I can thank Struggle for developing in me many of the traits I like most about myself. And Struggle in my life gives me the ability to teach my kids resilience. Empathy. Determination. Hope. So many intangibles that a perfect mom would not be able to model for her children. Because I'm flawed, I can perfectly prepare my kids to deal with the imperfect boss, the imperfect spouse, the imperfect child. Because I am weak, my children can see how little weakness can do to hold us back from living a life filled with purpose. Because I struggle in front of them daily, my children will inherently know not to run from the difficult things in life, because they see Struggle create in me such gratitude and joy over even the smallest blessings. My children have been dealt an awesome hand. The intrepid: What it's like to be a blind parent It's Mother's Day, and you might be an imperfect mom. Don't be afraid! Don't wish you were someone else. You're the mom your kids need most. You're the ideal person to prepare your children to thrive in this often less-than-ideal world. I've heard it said that your greatest strength is also your greatest weakness. But it could be that your greatest weakness is your greatest strength -- as a parent, as a person. Love an imperfect mom today, especially if that mom is you.

Follow the "Sassy Six" on Twitter and Facebook as they train to race the Nautica Malibu Triathlon with Dr. Sanjay Gupta on September 14. (CNN) -- I am 52 years old. I was not overweight for the first 32 years of my life. Then the emotional stress of losing my daughter to leukemia caused me to gain 70 pounds. Over the last 20 years, I have attempted to lose that weight many times, always with the notion that this time I would be perfect. It was all or nothing. When I couldn't maintain perfection, I stopped trying. I felt bad about myself, which led to increased emotional eating and less exercise. It was a vicious cycle. This journey is different. I do not consider this an attempt to lose weight but rather to improve my health and become stronger. This journey is about making lasting changes and understanding that I do not need to be perfect to make those changes. It's about learning to be nice to myself instead of feeling bad when I do not make the best choice. Weight loss surgery isn't a golden ticket In my earlier attempts, my only goal was to lose weight. I would start by doing hours and hours of cardio each week. I would follow the prescribed diet perfectly. I always had fantastic results in the first few weeks, but eventually, the weight loss would begin to slow. I stopped exercising as often, and I started to eat foods not on the prescribed diet plan. This was referred to as "cheating," which only made me feel worse about myself. Being told that I was "cheating" was not helpful; it just reinforced that all or nothing mentality. So I would eat tons of junk during the first few days of the week and then extremely limit my caloric intake in the days before a weigh-in. I wouldn't drink water on the day of weigh-in so the number on the scale would go down. If I knew I had gained weight that week, I would just skip the meeting. This journey is different. To have lasting success I must focus on total health. My previous weight loss attempts were sprints. This is a marathon (well, really it's a triathlon!), making lasting changes over the rest of my life. Beating myself up over a bad choice does not need to happen, because making better choices most of the time is what matters. 4 training tips for new triathletes Better nutritional choices are a part of my journey. I ran across a quote not long ago that said, "Every time we eat, we are either fighting disease or feeding it." As I choose what to eat, I try to reflect upon that quote. I eat more vegetables, include protein at each meal, and have cut out some of the sugar and non-whole-grain carbs. All of my food choices are not perfect, and that is OK. It is not all or nothing! Exercise, specifically training for the Nautica Malibu Triathlon, is also a part of my journey. Now when I exercise, I am thinking about how I am increasing my athletic ability, endurance and strength. I am not thinking about how this exercise is helping me lose weight, or how many calories I am burning. My form or pace is not perfect, and that is OK. Our assigned strength training is different than anything I have done before. Some exercises were almost impossible when I first started and remain challenging. I still do not do them with the perfect grace of people in the YouTube videos, and that is OK. In fact, Coach April tells us that once a strength exercise becomes easy, it is time to add something new. That "new" may include doing it on top of a Bosu ball, doing it on one leg, getting lower, increasing reps, etc. There is always a next challenge. My new energy, endurance, balance, strength and athletic ability will help me as I get older. My body aches are gone, and the motivation to keep moving comes from the knowledge that I can do so much more now than when I started a few months ago. The crew at CNN Fit Nation constantly remind us to "keep moving forward." That's what I intend to do. Visualizing my way to the finish line  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/09/health/fit-nation-triathlon-training-tips/index.html	health	4 training tips for new triathletes - CNN.com	2014/05/09	Friday May 9 07:12:50 EDT 2014	Editor's note: April Gellatly is the head coach for CNN's Fit Nation Triathlon Challenge program and owner of AG Multisport Consulting. Follow the "Sassy Six" on Twitter and Facebook as they train to race the Nautica Malibu Triathlon on September 14. (CNN) -- It's hard to know where to begin when you start a new sport -- and in the case of triathlon, you're starting three. The good news is that, more than likely, not all of these are completely new to you. It may have been many years since you have swam, biked or ran, but that doesn't change the nature of each activity. There's a reason they say, "It's just like riding a bike." With these tips, we'll have you racing toward the finish line in no time. Start within your comfort zone  The goal of most individuals starting a triathlon-training program is improved fitness. But your fitness level will only improve through consistent training. Starting within your comfort zone will allow you to find the joy in triathlon. If you enjoy it, you will keep at it. Are you more comfortable running than swimming? Are you better at biking than jogging? Pick the sport that suits you best to start. For the first two to three months of training, the CNN Fit Nation Sassy Six did more fitness-oriented training than triathlon-specific training. During this time, I allowed them to choose one or two of their cardio sessions each week. It wasn't important to me that they were doing a specific exercise, but simply that they were exercising. Focus on getting fit before you tackle a new sport. You have more to lose than pounds With cycling, safety comes first The Sassy Six has a rule: Never touch your bike without your helmet on. If you are new to cycling, I recommend you become a student of the sport. We take a risk every time we go out on our bikes, especially when riding with automotive traffic. The best place to start is by asking a lot of questions at your local bike shop. These guys will have knowledge of how your bike works -- shifting, braking, clipping in/out, etc. They will also likely have knowledge of safe places to ride locally. The first time you head out to ride, I recommend going to a large empty parking lot. Pedestrian traffic can be just as dangerous for new cyclists because they are unfamiliar with basic bike skills such as braking and turning. Remember, the hybrid or mountain bike you rode as a kid is a lot different than the road bike you're on now. It will take some getting used to. 5 rules for new triathletes Swimming should be a key part of your training Whether you are comfortable in the water or not, swimming should be an important part of your training program. This non-weight-bearing, aerobic exercise is going to help you get fit without as much wear and tear on your body as cycling or running. We had the Sassy Six in the water every day during Kick-Off Weekend, and now have them swimming two to three days a week leading up to the Nautica Malibu Triathlon. After all, we are preparing them to swim in the Pacific Ocean, which is no small feat. I taught them a series of drills that encourage proper body position and breathing. Learning to swim properly first will save you a lot of wasted effort in the long run (or swim). If you don't have a fitness swimming background, take a few lessons or join a group like U.S. Masters Swimming. Set goals and follow a program Setting S.M.A.R.T. mini goals will provide direction to your training and keep you moving forward. These goals can be anything from working out three days a week for a month to finishing a sprint triathlon in 12 weeks. Following a training program will help you reach your goals and encourage balance in your training. This balance will ensure that you go into your event prepared and help prevent injury. With the Sassy Six, we set the goal: The Nautica Malibu Classic Distance Triathlon. They knew when they applied for the CNN Fit Nation Program that we would be preparing them for this event. We provide a training program, which includes daily training instructions, and most of their equipment. So in less than five months, they'll be ready! How about you?

Follow the "Sassy Six" on Twitter and Facebook as they train to race the Nautica Malibu Triathlon with Dr. Sanjay Gupta on September 14. (CNN) -- Cue the music. The trumpets start in my head. Every workout turns into my very own "Rocky" movie. Naturally, I'm Rocky Balboa. Except, lucky for me, I'm not facing Clubber Lang (aka Mr. T) in the ring anytime soon. Instead I have my own score to settle -- with cancer. My opponent is the Nautica Malibu Triathlon. Fight night is September 14, 2014. "Gonna Fly Now" is the theme song from "Rocky." The song is synonymous with being the underdog who ultimately triumphs. Currently, I'm the underdog. But victory will come. See, I'm starting from zero. Testicular cancer stripped me of my good health; now, I'm taking it back. I visualize when I work out. I have to. Visualization gives me strength and inspires me. Even if the story is fiction, I grew up on these movies, and what they represent is far more important: hope. The music kicks in like a shot of adrenaline and pushes me to train harder. I'm trying to push my body back to a place it once was. There is a scene in "Rocky III" that I often replay in my head. Rocky and Apollo are dressed in their ridiculously short shorts and long socks (it was the early '80s, after all), and they're running on the beach when Rocky gives up. Making time for your health Rocky later admits he's scared. For this first time in his life, Rocky Balboa is scared. Unfortunately, I can't pretend that I've never been scared before; instead I have to admit that I still am. But this fear is different. It's the fear of the unknown. I'm treading in uncharted waters. And although I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, the pathway is dark. Exercise isn't new to me. It's something I used to thrive on. Training for a triathlon isn't even new to me. I had a regimen before. I'd swim in the mornings before work. Saturdays were my big workout days. If I wasn't doing a big run or ride, I'd take a spin class and jump right on the treadmill after and run 4 miles. Interestingly enough, that doesn't make it any easier. It's often more frustrating. Not being able to do what you used to do sometimes makes you not want to do it at all. It's a constant fight I have with myself. Trying to push through one barrier only to be stopped at the next makes me feel helpless. But failure isn't an option. I've been there before, so I have to believe I can do it again. I know I'll get there, I just don't know how. So I keep pushing on. I continue to visualize. Last Friday, I ran my first consecutive mile since my second surgery. It was a huge milestone for me, and I celebrated with my hands in the air while on a treadmill at the gym. Most onlookers laughed and probably assumed I was a bit crazy. But to me it was a big deal. From a minute to a mile: Learning to run  I have come so far, but this milestone was also a reminder of what I have in front of me, and how far I really have to go. I take a break from my visualizations to remember those who have come before me. What other cancer survivors have done humbles me. Like Rocky, they had to dig deep down inside of themselves and reach for more. Their perseverance also gives me inspiration. I've often heard it's how we face adversity that defines our character. If that's the case, this is my defining moment. I come back to "Rocky III" in my head. I can hear Apollo Creed: "To get it back, you have to go back to the beginning, Rock. .... Eye of the tiger." Patience is a virtue I'm still learning. The music fades. I am too young not to run

Confronting a life obstacle -- injury, illness or other hardship -- they tapped their inner strength and found resilience they didn't know they possessed. May 28 marks the 5th World MS Day, bringing attention to a condition that affects more than 2.3 million living with multiple sclerosis. Country music singer Julie Roberts is one of those people living with MS, but not letting it get in the way of her life. (CNN) -- Accepting my diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was probably the most difficult part of my MS journey. However, it also helped me retake control of my life. For years, I was in denial that I had MS. I thought if I didn't focus on my MS, then maybe it would just go away. It took the Nashville flood in May 2010 for me to "wake up" and decide it was time to take responsibility for what is, and what will be, my life with MS. My Mom, my sister and I lost our home and almost everything we owned in the flood. When we were rescued by boat, we were given another chance at life. I realized then that things can be replaced, but life and good health are invaluable. The stress from the flood brought on a relapse of my MS, which I could no longer ignore. At that point, I decided to accept that MS is part of who I am, and that I needed to learn how to manage it in order to continue living my dreams. I believe it was God who gave me another chance at life with the flood rescue and I wasn't going to waste it. I was determined to show this disease who was boss and that I would not let MS define my life's journey! I wanted to show the world that MS looks different for everyone and that MS does not mean you have to give up on your dreams. A diagnosis with any disease can be overwhelming, scary and confusing. Before, I, too, was scared and worried about how the world and the music industry would look at me if they knew I had MS. Would they judge me and stop booking me to sing places? Would I be able to continue playing shows? Would the dreams I'd been working toward my entire life be taken from me? If so, what else would I do? I can't say life is a piece of cake. Occasionally I still get asked whether my MS will interfere with my professional or personal life, but I respond every day by doing what I love. Can I continue to play my shows? Ask my fans who are there with me when I'm on tour around the world or playing a local nightspot. Can I write my songs? Listen to my current CD. Can I live a full and happy life? Come see the home I rebuilt after the flood. This doesn't mean I live my life in a haphazard way without a plan. I have developed a strong network of support, starting with my family. After hearing some positive things about my local MS Society chapter, I also reached out to it for information and found a mentor who has grown into a lifelong friend. I've learned to manage my MS by keeping all my options open. I have a neurologist who helps me control my MS with a disease-modifying therapy and address any symptoms that may appear. I am also much more than my MS and I manage my life through diet, exercise and my faith. I have learned that I do not have to give up on my dreams. I do still have the challenge of educating those within my professional field that MS won't stand in the way of performing concerts or being with my fans. It's a challenge I face head-on every day. I will continue to stand up for myself and those with MS and show the world that as people living with MS we can still do what we want to do.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/health/diet-soda-weight-loss/index.html	health	Diet soda helps weight loss, industry-funded study finds - CNN.com	2014/05/27	Tuesday May 27 12:10:12 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Most people choose artificially-sweetened soda over regular soda to avoid packing on extra pounds. But what if you already choose diet? Would it be helpful to quit that too? Dr. Jim Hill says he gets this question all the time from patients in his weight loss program at the University of Colorado's Anschutz Health and Wellness Center. With funding from the American Beverage Association, Hill helped design a study that divided approximately 300 adults into two groups: One group would continue drinking diet, and the other group -- referred to in the study as the "water group" -- would go cold turkey. The study was published in the journal Obesity. Both participant groups received intensive coaching on successful techniques for weight loss, including regular feedback on the meals they logged in journals. Participants weighed, on average, just over 200 pounds at the start of the study. "The results, to us, were not at all surprising," says Hill. While the typical participant banned from drinking diet sodas lost 9 pounds over 12 weeks, those allowed to continue drinking diet soda lost, on average, 13 pounds in the same time period. That's a 4-pound difference. Hill says that in his clinical experience, many people who have successfully lost significant weight "are heavy users of noncaloric sweeteners." But why was the diet soda group more successful? The most likely reason is that this group had the easier task. Cutting calories and boosting exercise takes a lot of willpower. Trying to simultaneously give up something else you regularly enjoy -- such as diet soda -- taxes your ability to stay the course. Most psychologists agree that our willpower is a limited resource. So while this study did not track calorie consumption, the group blocked from drinking diet sodas most likely ate (or drank) more calories over the course of the 12-week diet. Since the study lasted just 12 weeks, it remains to be seen whether artificial sweeteners are beneficial in the long-term, says Susan Swithers, a professor of Behavioral Neuroscience at Purdue University. Swithers authored a report last year that found that diet soda drinkers have the same health issues as those who drink regular soda. It found that people who drink diet soda may be "at increased risk of excessive weight gain, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease," according to the study. MORE: Study: Diet soda may do more harm than good "What the prospective studies actually suggest is that if you go out 7 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, the cohorts of individuals who are consuming diet sodas have much worse health outcomes," says Swithers. Those studies show a correlation, and are not designed to show causation. But some researchers like Swithers suspect artificial sweeteners ultimately increase the desire for sweets. "Doing these short-term studies that look at weight can't really tell us anything about whether or not these products are contributing to these increased risks," says Swithers. "And it's really hard to look at the (long-term) data and come up with any argument that they're helping." Hill, who along with four other researchers, designed the study, which was selected for funding by the American Beverage Association from among multiple competing proposals. The American Beverage Association's membership includes numerous Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola bottling companies. "It makes sense that it would have been harder for the water group to adhere to the overall diet than the (artificially-sweetened beverage) group," says Hill. He added, "The most likely explanation was that having access to drinks with sweet taste helps the (artificially-sweetened beverage) group to adhere better to the behavioral change program." Real or fake sugar: Does it matter? In short, this study addresses the question of whether a regular diet soda drinker should attempt to kick his or her habit while also attempting to lose weight, not whether we should all drink more diet soda in order to lose weight. Artificially-sweetened beverages "are not weight-loss enhancers, so it's not anything in the compounds themselves that are promoting weight loss," says Hill. Kristi Norton, a regular diet soda drinker before the study began, was assigned to the group that required her to kick the habit. At the time of her CNN interview, she was not aware of the study's findings. She says she lost 12 pounds during the course of the study, but the real difference is in how she feels. "I feel like I could 1000% tell the benefit of drinking water only. I felt better, I had more energy, I felt healthier, I just generally felt way better," says Norton. "And I can feel the difference now when I drink a diet drink, I can feel this 'heaviness'." Apparently This Matters: Virtual soda drinking

You're not alone: back problems send more Americans to the doctor annually than nearly any other medical problem, according to a 2013 Mayo Clinic study. Whether you're recovering from misjudging a heavy load (we've all been there), dealing with a lingering injury, or have a chronic problem, you don't necessarily need to resort to popping tons of pain relievers. Talk to your doc about these 15 expert-approved natural back pain remedies, and find out if they are safe and appropriate for you. Yoga Just say om. In a British study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, low-back pain sufferers who took one yoga class a week for three months saw greater improvements in function compared to those receiving conventional care like medicine or physical therapy. Health.com: 15 exercises for people in pain  Stretching The same study found that stretching is just as effective as yoga in treating back pain. The 52-minute stretching classes consisted of 15 exercises that stretched all major muscle groups, but emphasized the trunk and legs. Massage Two words: Treat yourself. Chronic low back pain sufferers who got weekly massages reported less pain after 10 weeks than those who didn't, according to another Annals of Internal Medicine study. Acupuncture If the idea of having needles inserted into your skin gives you the heebie-jeebies, try to have an open mindit may be the key to relieving your chronic back pain. In a study, people who received acupuncture treatments were more likely to find back pain relief than those receiving conventional care.

In a U.K. study, back pain sufferers who had 90 minutes of group cognitive behavioral therapy a week for six weeks reported less pain during the treatment. (Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on solving problems by changing thoughts and behavior.) A year later, 59% said their pain was totally cured, compared to just 31% in the group that did not go through therapy. Strength training Celebrity fitness trainer Kathy Kaehler has a test for you: "Stand with your back to a wall, shoulder blades pressed against it. Can you hold the position for the length of the song 'Happy Birthday'? If not, you'll need to strengthen your back and core." Building strength in those areas can help prevent and relieve back pain. Try these four moves. Health.com: Strength moves that burn fat  Physical therapy Good things come to those who waitexcept perhaps when it comes to back pain treatment. Starting physical therapy within two weeks of back pain onset was associated with less risk of need for subsequent medical care as well as lower overall health costs, according to a study published in the journal Spine. Osteopathic manual therapy In osteopathic manual therapy (OMT), an osteopath or chiropractor moves your back muscles using hands-on techniques such as stretching, light pressure, and resistance. One study found that people who underwent OMT for 12 weeks saw a 30% reduction in their pain level. Stress reduction Learning to keep your cool is as good for your back as it is for your mental health. When you're anxious, your body sets off the "fight or flight" response, which involves tensing your muscles so you're ready to spring into action. One European study revealed that people prone to negative thoughts and anxiety are more likely to suffer from back pain. Get calm now with these stress-busting solutions. Health.com: Best and worst ways to cope with stress  Meditation Meditation has been proven to reduce chronic pain in several scientific studies. Research from Duke University found that people suffering from chronic back pain saw significant reductions in pain and psychological distress after practicing a form of meditation that focuses on releasing anger. In another study, meditators experienced a 40% reduction in pain intensity. Comfrey root People who used an ointment that contains this plant-based extract for five days reduced the intensity of lower back pain by 95%, according to a 2009 study conducted by Merck (which manufactures the ointment). In comparison, a placebo group had a 38% reduction in pain during that same time, according to the study in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Look for comfrey root ointment in health food stores or online. Just don't use it for more than 10 days at a timeit can be toxic. Aquatic therapy Aquatic therapy is essentially physical therapy in a pool. Instead of using weights for resistance, patients use the resistance of the water. Studies show it may help alleviate lower back pain. In one 2013 study, sedentary adults who underwent aquatic therapy five times a week for two months saw reductions in pain and increases in quality of life. One smaller study found that aquatic therapy also helped pregnant women who were experiencing aching lower backs. Tai Chi This slow-moving form of Chinese martial arts may be an effective back pain treatment. In a 2011 American College of Rheumatology study, people who completed two 40-minute Tai Chi sessions a week for 10 weeks reduced pain intensity 1.3 points on a zero to 10 scale. Health.com: 27 Mistakes Healthy People Make  The Alexander technique A form of physical therapy, practitioners of the Alexander technique teach patients how to adjust their posture during everyday activities to reduce muscular tension and stress. In a BMJ study, people who took lessons in the Alexander technique saw long-term improvement in pain and quality of life. Pilates It may be tempting to quit exercising when you're suffering from back pain, but it's essential to keep yourself moving. Pilates is one great option. In a 2014 European Journal of Physical Rehabilitation Medicine study, researchers found an improvement in pain, disability, and psychological health in chronic low-back pain patients who took five hour-long Pilates classes a week for six months. Meanwhile, people who remained inactive experienced further worsening of their pain. Similarly, a Medicine and Science in Sport and Exercise study revealed that taking either Pilates or a general exercise class twice a week for six weeks both improved pain and quality of life.

(CNN) -- You see it on TV all the time: People losing hundreds of pounds, going from couch potatoes to athletes, transforming themselves into different (and happier) human beings. How do they do it when most people struggle to lose 10 or 15 pounds? Big weight loss requires big lifestyle changes that stick for more than a few weeks, and it almost always involves a true life transformation. Yes, learning to eat very differently and move more -- a lot more -- are required, but that alone doesn't always produce extreme results. Do you want to experience a big life transformation? Here are five strategies to get you on your way. And none of them are about how to eat or how much you need to exercise: 1. Get comfortable being uncomfortable.  Transforming your life requires stepping out of your comfort zone. Let's face it, being comfortable and doing the behaviors you do right now got you to the weight and place you are today. If you are OK with that, keep doing what you are doing. If not, you need to prepare yourself for true change -- and this means being willing to embrace feeling uncomfortable. No real transformation happens inside your comfort zone. 2. Get your mind right. Eating right and exercise are critical pieces to any physical transformation, but a mental transformation is just as important. People who succeed develop an optimistic or positive attitude about their new life. They expect success; they believe they can and will succeed. They concentrate on what they get to do in their new life, NOT what they can't do. They savor positive moments, and enjoy the journey! 3. Figure out your deeper 'Why?' True transformation requires powerful motivation. This motivation comes from linking your new lifestyle to the things you most want to accomplish. Look a little deeper and consider your purpose in life. Is it to run your own company, keep up with your children, help the underserved or be a better spouse? Identifying how your new lifestyle will help you achieve these things is what will get you up at 5 a.m. or allow you to pass up your favorite dessert when necessary. Linking your new lifestyle to your passions makes a transformation permanent, not temporary. Successful transformers spend time peeling back the layers and determining why they really want to lose weight, to better understand who they really are inside! 4. Be the hero in your own movie. Only you have the power to change you. One of the most important steps in any transformation is deciding to stop playing the victim role. Realizing you have the power to write your story is critical to achieving true transformation. Things do not happen TO you anymore; YOU create opportunities and direct your new life. You are empowered to choose what you will do and how you will react. 5. Pay it forward.  Successful transformers appreciate what they have been given and how their lives have changed for the better. They want to help others change their life and experience the power of transformation, and by doing this, they help themselves. It's contagious!  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/23/health/cheap-food-obesity/index.html	health	Report: Cheap food makes us fat - CNN.com	2014/05/23	Friday May 23 09:53:00 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Forget everything you know about what's making us fat. We hear a lot about Americans being fast food-addicted couch potatoes, and while that does play a role in the nation's expanding waist lines, a new study concludes it's not the driving force behind the obesity epidemic. Instead all Americans -- no matter what income level they have and no matter what neighborhood they live in -- are getting bigger because food is cheaper than ever before, the study authors say. Simply put, we're spending less of our total budget on food so we're buying more. The study, published in the June edition of the journal CA Cancer, found that people in 1930 spent about a fourth of their disposable income on food. Today food takes up about a tenth of our disposable income. Food is also easier to prepare and easier to purchase than it was in 1930. That means Americans aren't just eating more high-calorie food, they are eating more of a variety of foods. Consequently, Americans have consumed, on average, about 20% more calories since the 1970s. Lead study authors Roland Sturm and An Ruopeng hope it will lay to rest some myths about obesity. He lost 125 pounds, but still felt fat "If you look at the data over time, you actually see a slight increase in exercise. And Americans have more access to fruits and vegetables," said Roland Sturm who is a senior economist at the RAND Corporation. "It's not Southern hospitality that is driving this trend, nor is it income or education. Really nothing protects us from this challenge of obesity." On average, Americans have been getting fatter since at least the 1950s, maybe even longer. While the data isn't perfect, experts looking at health records for men between the ages of 40 and 49 see a steady increase in body mass index since 1900. Obesity isn't only a problem for people who want to wear bikinis to the beach. Excess body fat can raise a person's risk for heart disease, cancer, diabetes, stroke and chronic illnesses. "What this article reinforces is that we need to continue our research to find what combination of strategies will be most effective long term in helping all of us live healthier lives," said Colleen Doyle, director of nutrition and physical activity for the American Cancer Society. Doyle suggests a better built environment where it is easy for people to engage in physical activity -- meaning sidewalks and bike lanes and safer streets. Also helpful would be changing social norms so that families will expect healthier school meals and calorie counts are readily available on restaurant menus. "No one thing is the solution to this problem we are having," Doyle said. Can you really control where you lose fat? This latest study points out a few positives. Americans are exercising more: Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show an uptick in the number of people who say they get 30 minutes of moderate exercise five or more days a week, or 20 minutes of vigorous activity on three or more days (about 51% in 2009, compared to 46% in 2001). The availability of fresh produce has also increased over the last 40 years, with a 27% increase in fresh fruit and a 21% increase in fresh vegetables per capita from 1970 to 2010. But the number of people who actually eat fruits and vegetables has stayed flat. That may be one area where public policy could help. Agriculture policy "has a huge impact on what people eat," said study co-author An Ruopeng. "Maybe instead of promoting commodity food like corn and soy, we could instead incentivize small farms to grow more fruits and vegetables." "We don't want food to become really expensive again; that is not the answer," said Sturm. "The markets were successful in solving a really old problem" of food scarcity. "Now we have a new problem in the works with obesity, so we may need the market forces now to nudge in a different direction." How to break your junk food addiction Sturm believes a policy South Africa has tried may help. In some 800 supermarkets in the African country, healthy foods were subsidized and available at a 25% discount. The price did "nudge people in the right direction" to eat healthier. A tax on sugary foods and sodas in Mexico was also introduced last year, but experts are still waiting to see what impact that policy will have on eating habits. Here in the United States, some members of Congress have introduced similar taxes, but haven't been able to get them passed. It will take more than public policy to end the obesity epidemic, the study authors say. "There is no silver bullet," Sturm said. True change would have to come from the ground up. Smoking, for instance, used to be common indoors, but policy and social attitude has made that less socially acceptable. "When people come over to visit, you offer them a coke or freshly baked cookies," Sturm said. "That is the social norm. But maybe in the future we will look at that behavior like we do about public smoking." Two big meals may be better than six small ones  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/23/health/beef-recall/index.html	health	Stores in 15 states could have received tainted beef - CNN.com	2014/05/23	Friday May 23 08:02:53 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Check your ground beef before you grill this Memorial Day weekend. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service says stores in at least 15 states may have received beef contaminated with E. coli O157:H7. The service announced this week that 1.8 million pounds of ground beef products were being recalled because they could be contaminated. The federal agency has since named businesses that may have received the tainted products. Stores that may be affected include:  Gordon Food Service Marketplace stores in Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wisconsin  Giorgio's Italian Delicatessen in Stuart, Florida  Surf N Turf Market in Sebring, Florida  Blairsville Seafood Market in Blairsville, Georgia  Butcher Block Plus in Decatur, Illinois  M Sixty Six General Store in Orleans, Michigan  Harvest Moon Co-op in Long Lake, Minnesota  Foscoe Country Corner in Boone, North Carolina  Bronson's Super Valu in Beulah, North Dakota  Jason's Super Foods in New Town, North Dakota  Buchtel Food Mart in Buchtel, Ohio  Chunky Foods in Girard, Ohio  Ian's Market in Englewood, Tennessee  Quick Stop in Erwin, Tennessee  Virginia Market in Maynardville, Tennessee  Barger Foods in Nashville, Tennessee  Stanley Valley Market in Surgoinsville, Tennessee  Parkway Tobacco Express in Appomattox, Virginia  Kelley's Market in Eagle Rock, Virginia  Virginia Heights Travel Store in Wytheville, Virginia What government tests found in your meat A representative for the U.S. Department of Agriculture said the meat is being removed from store shelves. But consumers should return or throw out meat that has the code EST.2574B and a production date between March 31 and April 18, 2014. The ground beef is sold under a variety of labels, according to the USDA, but comes from Wolverine Packing Co. in Detroit. "While none of the Wolverine Packing product has tested positive for the pathogen implicated in this outbreak, the company felt it was prudent to take this voluntary recall action in response to the illnesses and initial outbreak investigation findings," said Chuck Sanger, a spokesman for Wolverine Packing. Eleven people across four states are suspected to have been sickened by the product, according to the USDA, which learned about the first such illnesses on May 8. Ten of those people were sickened after eating at restaurants that received contaminated meat. But federal officials say regulations prohibit them from naming those restaurants. "People who were exposed were already exposed, so it doesn't help the public to tell them now that a certain restaurant was associated with these illnesses," said David Goldman, assistant administrator for the Office of Public Health Science at the USDA. "Our job really is to identify product that may still be available." According to information officials received from the packing company, he said, the meat went to many states. "The number changes. Yesterday, it was on the order of nearly 40 states, but we don't -- that number changes. That's part of the process, too, is to identify where the food -- the meat in this case -- was actually distributed," Goldman said. The recall was categorized by the Food Safety and Inspection Service as Class I: a health hazard situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death. E. coli is a large group of bacteria that live in the intestines of people and animals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Certain strains cause gastrointestinal illness in humans, with symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea. An estimated 265,000 infections occur in the United States each year, the CDC says. People usually get sick three to four days after ingesting the bacteria and recover on their own. Young children, pregnant women, the elderly and people who have weakened immune systems (like cancer or HIV patients) are at greater risk for severe illness and death. The best way to avoid getting sick is by washing hands frequently when preparing food and avoiding cross-contamination by washing cutting boards, counters and utensils with hot, soapy water. Properly washing hands after using the bathroom and after coming into contact with animals or being in their environments -- anywhere there may be traces of feces -- also helps. Cooking meats thoroughly to at least 160F or 70C kills the bacteria and prevents infection as well. Using a meat thermometer will most accurately help you determine that the food is thoroughly cooked. Eatocracy: Don't get sick from your picnic Food Safety and Inspection Service officials said in a news release that the agency is continuing to work with state and federal public health partners on the investigation and provide updated information as it becomes available. After CNN exclusive, USDA probing 'personnel issues' in meat recall How 9 million pounds of bad meat escaped into the food supply Food safety tips from a pro CNN's Chris Frates, David Fitzpatrick, Jacque Wilson, Miriam Falco, Elizabeth Cohen, William Hudson, Greg Botelho and Stephanie Smith contributed to this report. 
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/23/health/sunscreen-rules/index.html	health	Sunscreen 101: Don't forget your nose - CNN.com	2014/05/23	Friday May 23 07:02:04 EDT 2014	Editor's note: This story was originally published on CNN in August 2013. We're bringing it back so you can protect yourself at the pool and beach this summer. Happy "Don't Fry Day!" (Health.com) -- Unless you've been living under a rock, you know to apply sunscreen. There's lifesaving reason to: About 3.5 million cases of skin cancer will be diagnosed this year. "The incidence of skin cancer, including melanoma -- the deadliest kind -- is going up, and wearing sunscreen is one of the best ways to prevent it," says Dr. Ronald Moy, a dermatologist and spokesperson for the Skin Cancer Foundation. Stick with these smart tips to make sure you're as protected as you can possibly be. Select a sunscreen you love Finding your sunscreen soul-mate is the key motivating factor for using it regularly, experts agree. "If you think your sunscreen is pasty, thick or smelly, you have the wrong kind," says Dr. Jeffrey Dover, clinical associate professor of dermatology at Yale University. "It may make you less likely to put it on, or to reapply when you do." Happily, there are plenty of lightweight, sheer formulas on the market. Health.com: Which sunscreen is best for you?  Remember, SPF 30 is the new 15 As a general rule, SPF 15 blocks 93% of UVB rays, SPF 30 blocks 97% and SPF 50 blocks 98%. Doctors now typically recommend at least SPF 30 -- at least being the key words. If you have a family history of skin cancer or are vacationing in a tropical spot (where the sun is especially intense), go for 50 or even 70. Just keep in mind: No sunscreen provides 100% protection. So to be safe as possible, you still need to reapply every two hours and after a swim, even if you used the water-resistant kind, says Dr. Joshua Zeichner, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. FYI, sunscreen becomes less effective about three years after you open the container. Health.com: Is it a mole...or skin cancer?  Check labels for the term broad-spectrum It means the sunscreen provides protection against both UVA (wrinkle- and cancer-causing) and UVB (burning) rays. Problem is, that labeling rule only went into effect in December and stores still sell inventory made prior to it, notes Dr. Steven Wang, director of dermatologic surgery and dermatology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. So if you're shopping and there's no broad-spectrum mention, check the ingredients for zinc or avobenzone, the only two that provide top-notch UVA coverage, he says. Health.com: 7 ways you're aging your skin Layer it on Think you apply enough? Almost no one does. "Several big studies show that most people rub in only about a fourth of what's needed to reach the labeled SPF -- it's faster and easier to put on just a bit," notes Dover. Instead of that old advice to use a shot glass-size dose, all our experts recommend applying two coats. Squeeze a line of lotion down your arms and legs and rub in, then do it again. Ditto for spray formulas: hold the nozzle close to your skin and spray, moving slowly up and down until you see a sheen, then go back over the area. For your face, apply a pea-size drop to each cheek, your forehead and your chin, then smear in. Repeat! Health.com: Sun-proof your skin from a to z Don't forget your nose It's the number one sunburn-spot, dermatologists say. "People apply sunscreen to their face, but either skip or speed over their nose -- especially if they wear glasses, because they don't want to take them off," Wang says. Moy adds, "80% of the skin cancers I remove are on the nose." Other commonly missed areas include the feet, hair part, ears and chest, as well as the backs of hands and legs. Use a sunscreen stick to spot-apply. Get antioxidant insurance Since rays can still get through sunscreen, companies are now including antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and green tea to help mitigate damage. If you don't want to bother applying a serum that contains them beneath your moisturizer or sunscreen (Wang's first choice), try a souped-up SPF pick. Realize that sunscreen is only one part of a sun-smart plan "The hierarchy of sun protection should be avoidance first, then seek shade and wear a wide-brim hat and protective clothing, then use sunscreen -- but most people have that sequence backward," Wang points out. Consider hitting the beach or pool in the morning instead of midday (when sun is strongest), and bring an umbrella and a tightly woven long-sleeve shirt. Know that it's never too late to start safe habits So you baked in the sun as a teen with little or no sunscreen. While regular tanning or getting several bad burns when you're young raises your risk of skin cancer, Moy says, what's critical is that you put on sunscreen these days. "Since skin's ability to repair itself decreases with age, your risk is even greater if you burn now." Good thing you're using it! Photos: Your worst sunburns ever  Copyright Health Magazine 2011 
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/09/health/blomberg-surgery-questions/index.html	health	5 questions to ask before surgery - CNN.com	2014/05/09	Friday May 9 07:15:04 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Dr. Adam Blomberg is the national education director for Sheridan Healthcare's anesthesia division. He also is the director of clinical education at Memorial Regional Hospital, Sheridan Healthcare's flagship anesthesia practice, in Hollywood, Florida.  (CNN) -- Preparing for surgery can be stressful and overwhelming. Feelings of uneasiness are common, but you don't have to feel that way. You're fully empowered to ask questions and seek answers before you enter the operating room. Your doctors and nurses are your ultimate resources. They are there to guide you through what we call the perioperative process: before, during and after surgery. From the moment the surgery is scheduled until your post-op recovery is complete, you should feel comfortable to ask any question that arises. Educating yourself is one of the best ways to eliminate any anxiety and empower yourself as a patient. The following are some questions that you should ask as you move through the process: 1. Do I have to have this surgery? First and foremost, find out if you must have surgery. Is it medically necessary? Are there any alternatives? What are the risks and benefits associated with each option? Will your insurance cover the procedure? Many people depend on the Internet to answer these questions. Anyone can type "surgery" or "pre-op" into a search engine and find all sorts of information, but I caution my patients to avoid going online to learn about their surgeries. Weight loss surgery isn't a golden ticket You can reference the Internet as a guide, but remember it is built for general information, not detailed information about a specific case. Every patient is an individual. And I remind my family that "doctors don't look for zebras, they look for horses" -- you're not likely to be the rare "zebra" case that an Internet search might bring up. 2. Where is the surgery being done, and what is the facility's experience with this type of procedure? After you determine that you need to have surgery, you have to think about where you're having it. You'll want to look at the experience and expertise of the surgeon, staff and hospital. Do they have established experience with the particular type of surgery you are having? Do you have to go to a specific hospital, or are there several from which to choose? Could the procedure be done at a surgical center or outpatient facility? If your child is the patient, make sure the hospital has experience with pediatric patients. The same goes for the elderly. You'll also want to check with your health insurance carrier about what facilities they will cover. Some insurance plans will not pay for a procedure unless the facility is "in network" -- in other words, your primary care provider may have to have a relationship with a particular facility. 3. How do I prepare for my procedure -- both physically and mentally?  The physical preparation is hands-down the most important, individualized part of the surgical process. For some people, little preparation is needed. For others, it may be necessary to speak to your primary care provider, cardiologist or other specialists. Blindsided by cancer: 5 things to do Find out if you need any testing beforehand, or if you need to make any changes to your medication regimen. Ask your doctor about eating and drinking before the procedure. If you're a smoker, find out how that could affect your preparation. Make sure you are eating well and getting enough sleep. It's important to take good care of yourself before having surgery. Mental preparation is also key. You need to prepare your family or friends, because chances are you'll need their assistance when you come home. Be sure to have caregivers ready to help you. Don't have the unreal expectation that you will go back to your regular routine instantly. 4. What are my anesthesia options? For many people, anesthesia is one of the most concerning aspects of surgery. Talk to your doctor about the different types of anesthesia. Some surgeries require a specific type of anesthesia, but you may have options. If you do have the option of choosing what kind to have, make sure you understand ahead of time what the risks and benefits are. Being nervous about anesthesia is normal, but educating yourself will help alleviate your fears. As an anesthesiologist, I always remind people that my job is to wake people up, not just put them to sleep. 5. What will my recovery be like?  Complications are sometimes unavoidable after surgery, but you can help reduce some of the risks by following your doctor's instructions and caring for yourself before you head into the operating room. You may not be better off after knee surgery After surgery, you may have pain, nausea or vomiting. Ask your doctor what you can do to alleviate these common reactions. Learn what your expected recovery time frame will be like. Ask about your pain management options. And be sure your loved ones understand what to expect in the weeks following the surgery. Knowing what to expect makes the recovery process easier.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/13/health/frieden-global/index.html	health	CDC: 5 ways diseases in other countries can kill you - CNN.com	2014/02/13	Thursday Feb 13 10:06:06 EST 2014	Editor's note: Dr. Tom Frieden is director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Thursday, the United States joined more than 25 nations and international organizations to launch the Global Health Security Agenda, an effort to accelerate progress toward a world free of infectious disease.  (CNN) -- The world is smaller and people are more mobile than at any time in history. This makes it easier than ever for what's happening anywhere on the globe to harm Americans' health.  Here are five ways diseases in other countries pose a threat: The flu could threaten millions. Even in a mild year for flu, in the United States alone, there are thousands of deaths, hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations, and billions of dollars in productivity losses. In a pandemic, millions of people worldwide could be killed. H7N9 influenza, also known as bird flu, is spreading in China, though fortunately it has not mutated to become an infectious disease outbreak that could threaten the health of people around the world. Antibiotic resistance is on the rise. Antibiotic resistance just might be the most urgent health threat facing us now. The nightmare strain of bacteria known as CRE, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, arose abroad and was introduced to one state in the United States. Now it's in at least 44 states. It can resist all or almost all antibiotics, kills many of the people who get it in their blood, and spreads its resistance capabilities to other bacteria. The World Health Organization estimates multidrug-resistant tuberculosis already has infected a half a. million people across the globe. A nightmare health scenario we can stop Diseases don't respect borders. Going abroad can expose travelers to more than new cultures and once-in-a-lifetime experiences. More than 1,500 U.S. travelers get malaria every year, and the numbers are increasing. Yellow fever is spread by mosquitoes and causes more than 30,000 deaths worldwide each year, primarily in tropical areas of Africa and Latin America. People coming back from safari might bring back more than just pictures; they could find themselves facing African trypanosomiasis, better known as sleeping sickness, transmitted by the tsetse fly found only in rural Africa. "Foreign" diseases are now domestic threats. We think of parasitic diseases as risks to travelers, but they harm people here at home as well. For example, Chagas disease is a chronic infection generally acquired by people in rural areas of Latin America, but about 300,000 people now living in the United States have this disease. Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease common in the tropics that infects more than 60 million people in the United States. While the immune system usually keeps the parasite from making people sick, it can cause death attributed to foodborne illness. Emerging infections: What's the next HIV? Mosquito-borne diseases such as West Nile virus, dengue, and chikungunya infect hundreds of thousands of people each year and are spreading globally. In the past few years, we've seen global outbreaks of Ebola and other deadly viral hemorrhagic fevers. 5 health challenges for 2014 There are many diseases out there that we don't even know about. Our new effort can prevent them from becoming epidemics. That's why CDC partners with nations all over the world to detect and respond to disease outbreaks. Together we responded to more than 250 outbreaks in 2013. No single country can deal with these health threats alone. Cooperation between countries has tremendous impact in early detection. Early detection of a single case of Ebola virus in 2011 led to an immediate response and the disease was stopped in its tracks. Previous similar outbreaks were large and spread rapidly through communities there. CDC is helping countries around the world strengthen their ability to prevent avoidable catastrophes and epidemics, detect threats early, and respond rapidly and effectively. Stopping outbreaks where they occur is the most effective and least expensive way to save lives at home as well as abroad. And it's the right thing to do. That's why we announced Thursday that the United States, through the work of the CDC and the departments of Agriculture, State, and Defense, has committed to cooperate with at least 30 partner countries to better prevent, detect, and effectively respond to infectious disease threats, better protecting at least 4 billion people around the world -- including the United States -- from threats. How to prevent the next pandemic And we have called on partner countries to work together so that effective prevention, detection, and response are present in every country around the world. This year CDC and the Department of Defense have pledged $40 million to expand to 10 additional countries in addition to the pilot projects in Uganda and Vietnam. President Obama will request an additional $45 million in 2015 to accelerate progress around the world. It's an essential step in strengthening global health security that will protect Americans, strengthen our nation's global partnerships, and increase health security capacity around the world. Helping other countries makes those countries, and the United States, safer. The most infectious of all infectious diseases  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/03/health/digital-eyestrain/index.html	health	How to avoid digital eyestrain - CNN.com	2014/02/03	Monday Feb 3 07:13:29 EST 2014	Editor's note: Dr. Edward Kondrot, founder of the Healing The Eye & Wellness Center, is the world's only board-certified ophthalmologist and board-certified homeopathic physician. He has recently been named clinic director of the Integrative Medicine Clinic at The American Medical College of Homeopathy in Phoenix and is president of the Arizona Homeopathic and Integrative Medical Association. (CNN) -- Our lives have increasingly become more digital today. While some may see this as a benefit, others are finding that it can literally be a pain in the eye. Digital eyestrain is now a common problem. Eye and vision problems are reported in 70 to 75% of computer workers, according to the American Optometric Association. Headaches, eye pain, redness, watering, double vision and loss of focus are all associated with digital eyestrain. The good news is there are numerous things you can do to help avoid the condition, including: Take a break. Take frequent 15 minute breaks and focus your eyes on a distant object across the room. This will give the focusing muscle a chance to relax. Try palming. This is essentially meditation for the eyes. To do this, you will close your eyes and place the centers of your palms over your eyes. Take deep slow breaths and relax your eye muscles. This is a wonderful way to rejuvenate your eyes during those long computer projects. Keep your shoulders and neck relaxed. Tension in this area will cause a tension in your eyes. An occasional neck and shoulder massage will also work wonders. Blink frequently. When doing demanding digital work, your blink rate decreases. A conscious effort should be made to blink lightly every 10 to 15 seconds. This will coat the cornea, or front part of the eye, to nourish your eye with oxygen and nutrients -- and the coating of tears will also sharpen your vision. Wear computer glasses. Use a pair of computer glasses and work at the proper distance -- 20 to 28 inches, depending on the focal point of the eye. Computer glasses have a different focal point than reading glasses. This will reduce the effort of focusing and putting a strain on your eyes. The extra effort to focus will cause tension in the eye muscles, which in addition to causing eye discomfort can lead to an increase in eye pressure. Your smartphone is a pain in the neck Keep your monitor bright. This will reduce the flicker rate of the computer and reduce fatigue. Flickering can lead to eyestrain and headaches. A bright monitor causes the pupil to constrict and a greater range of focus will result. This will reduce the need for your eye to accommodate and enable you to work longer with more comfort. Reduce blue light at night. A Harvard study revealed that blue light at night negatively reduces melatonin levels, which have a serious adverse health effect. It is associated with an increased incidence of diabetes, obesity and cancer. Reduce computer time at night or wear blue blocking glasses. These will block out the harmful blue spectrum light at night. Take vitamins and minerals. Considering that the eyes have one of the highest energy requirements in the body, it is important that they get proper amounts of vitamins and minerals. It is important to opt for a vitamin that offers key antioxidants and ingredients that will help improve the health of the eye and reduce eyestrain. Those can include vitamins A, C, and E with a B complex and zinc. Homeopathy. Speak with a practitioner to find a level of therapy that will work for your individual circumstances. One of the most common homeopathic remedies to treat eyestrain is Ruta Graveolens, a common ornamental plant found in gardens that is used to treat strains of tendons. This remedy can greatly reduce the symptoms of eyestrain during prolonged computer use. Increase the light. Not having a light on when you are using the computer (or television) can put more of a strain on your eyes. Be sure to have a light on to help reduce the strain. Check your computer's position. The position of your computer can add to your eyestrain. It is important that it is positioned a good distance away, around 20-28 inches from the eye, and that there are no glares on it. Re-position your computer to provide maximum eye comfort. Following the tips above can help reduce your chances of getting digital eyestrain. You will feel better and be able to work longer.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/24/health/raison-anxiety/index.html	health	Here's what to do about your anxiety - CNN.com	2014/01/24	Friday Jan 24 06:40:26 EST 2014	Editor's note: Watch our anxiety Google Hangout: CNN's Kat Kinsman chatted live about anxiety with mental health experts as well as others who experience anxiety and want to talk about it.  (CNN) -- Dr. Charles Raison, CNN's mental health expert, addresses two questions from readers reacting to a piece on anxiety from Kat Kinsman, CNN Eatocracy managing editor, on her lifelong struggle with the condition. Look for Raison to address other questions in the future. Q: Can using marijuana or having a drink or two be helpful for people with anxiety? What should they watch out for? Dr. Raison: If one goes on any search engine looking for study results related to marijuana or alcohol and depression or anxiety, one will immediately see that most of the evidence tells a cautionary tale. Many studies suggest that regular use of either marijuana or alcohol is associated with an increased risk for a variety of mental health problems, anxiety and depression among them. Increasing data suggests that regular marijuana use in adolescence may also be a risk factor for developing very serious psychotic disorders, especially schizophrenia. In addition to promoting other disorders, alcohol is especially liable to abuse and dependence and has ruined innumerable people's lives for millennia. Far fewer studies have examined whether using these compounds in moderation might improve depression or anxiety. But as Socrates noted almost 2,000 years ago, alcohol is both a blessing and a curse to mankind. Indeed, now we know that the regular modest use of alcohol actually promotes a number of health factors. Similarly, it is increasingly clear that many of the chemicals within marijuana hold great promise for the treatment of physical pain. The endocannabinoid system in the brain -- which is a primary target for marijuana -- has profound effects on how people think and feel. My son is mentally ill, so listen up For example, increasing evidence suggests that the "runners high" many people get after strenuous exercise is produced primarily by activation of the brain's' internal endocannabinoid system. Other chemicals in marijuana impact other brain pathways, like serotonin, that are known to play a role in depression and anxiety. People have been taking a drink or two in the evening since time immemorial. And many people will attest that this practice helps them shed the cares of the day. Recently, I've met with several very experienced psychiatrists who have been recommending small amounts of marijuana use for for very depressed patients who haven't responded to antidepressants. In some patients, they are reporting remarkable improvements. But the problem at this point is that while many studies have shown an association between alcohol/marijuana and mental illness, I don't know of any really rigorous studies looking at the therapeutic potential of either for depression and anxiety. Answering the question of what people who use these substances should watch out for is easier. They should watch out for the possibility that they become more anxious or depressed after drinking or using marijuana. And they should keep a close eye on their use, especially use of alcohol, which can be highly addictive. Whatever potential benefit alcohol and marijuana may offer is 100% lost once they are abused. Q: What are the best anxiety treatments who don't want (or are afraid) to take medicines? Is there anything that might ease their concerns? Is there a point where medication becomes essential? Dr. Raison: By far the best studied non-medicine treatment for depression or anxiety is psychotherapy. Literally hundreds of studies have shown that on average psychotherapy works as well for these conditions as do medications. Of the various psychotherapies, the best studied is cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT. But studies are being done all the time, and other forms of therapy are also emerging as highly effective. Over and above the type of therapy employed, a key factor of therapeutic success is the "fit" between the client/patient and therapist. In practical terms, this means that people should feel comfortable with their therapists. If one feels ignored, looked down upon, dismissed or attacked, it is very unlikely the therapy will be successful. Very often when therapy works people start feeling better within a few weeks, so this is also something to look for. No other non-medical treatment for depression or anxiety has anywhere near the amount of supporting evidence that psychotherapy does. Having said this, significant evidence now points to the usefulness of exercise for improving mental health. Especially when it comes to depression, exercise has been repeatedly shown to be of value. Both strength training and aerobic exercise have benefits and combining them is the best of all. However, to get the full antidepressant effect of exercise requires real commitment. To work optimally, exercise must be engaged in for at least 30 minutes a day five days a week. And the intensity level should be such that one has some difficulty carrying on a conversation while doing it. Anxiety, you're not the boss of me However, other health benefits accrue from far less strenuous exercise and in general many people feel better with even moderate exercise. Several supplements have shown promise in depression. Both SAMe and L-methylfolate have shown promise as additions to people not fully responding to antidepressants. Most of us in the field think they also work by themselves, although more data are needed. The data for St. John's Wort is plus/minus. Some evidence suggests that omega-3 fatty acids and N-acetyl-cysteine may also hold promise for the treatment of depression If someone has a pattern of becoming depressed every winter, bright light therapy with a light box delivering at least 10,000 lux of light has been shown to be very effective. About 10% of the population suffers from some degree of low mood and energy in winter. This phenomenon is more common in cold, dark, gray places than in warm, sunny Southern ones. The power of a light box to lift mood and give energy can really be exceptional. This is an option that is sadly too often overlookied. Many people swear by a variety of non-traditional approaches. The bottom line is that if someone is helped by these modalities and not harmed, the goal has been achieved.

On May 17, local, state and federal health officials reported preliminary tests showed that the businessman appeared to test positive for MERS. He had met with the first confirmed MERS patient in the United States, a U.S. resident who had traveled from Saudi Arabia to Indiana. However, after more extensive blood tests, the "CDC has concluded that the Illinois resident was not previously infected with MERS-CoV," according to the agency. MERS is a coronavirus, the same group of viruses as the common cold. It attacks the respiratory system, according to the CDC. Symptoms can lead to pneumonia or kidney failure. It was first found in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012. Florida MERS patient recovers

Hagel's move comes the same day the Department of Veteran Affairs announced veterans waiting for appointments for more than 30 days at VA hospitals and clinics will have an opportunity to see a doctor sooner. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told CNN that Hagel had been considering the review for some time but decided to act now as he saw the VA scandal, first uncovered by CNN, unfold. The review, which is expected to last for 90 days, will focus on three areas: access to care, hospital safety and quality of care. Meanwhile, amid heavy pressure to address allegations of scheduling tricks and secrets lists to hide monthslong waits for care, the VA released details of its "Accelerated Access to Care Initiative." Those accusations have mushroomed since CNN first reported the problem in November in a detailed investigation examining several VA hospitals, reports that prompted President Barack Obama and lawmakers to call for investigations. Part of the initiative, which the VA says was implemented on May 23, calls for all veterans waiting more than 30 days for an appointment to be contacted by the VA to determine whether they want to be seen by a doctor sooner. According to the initiative, the VA will make at minimum three attempts to contact each veteran. If the veteran wants to see a doctor sooner, "and the capacity and resources exist -- (following the facility assessment), the veteran will be scheduled into new appointment openings," according to a fact sheet provided by the VA. If a facility can't handle all of the patients, "non-VA medical care referral will begin," it said. Under the initiative, reviews have been ordered of each VA facility to determine whether it can handle its current patient load. This includes examining whether VA clinics need to extend hours or approve overtime so more veterans can be seen. The reviews are expected to be completed by Friday, according the VA. Obama has promised to hold accountable anyone found to have manipulated or falsified records. The most disturbing problems emerged at the Phoenix VA, with sources revealing details of a secret waiting list. According to the sources, at least 40 American veterans died while waiting for care at the VA there. The top officials at the Phoenix VA denied any existence of a secret waiting list after CNN's initial Phoenix report went out. A fatal wait: Veterans languish and die on a VA hospital's secret list The director of the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care system and two others were placed on administrative leave after the allegations made headlines and raised ire in Washington. The allegations have been followed by news of investigations at more than two dozen facilities across the nation. Timeline: VA's troubled history CNN's Dana Ford contributed to this report. 
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/20/health/tweak-diet-age/index.html	health	7 ways you should tweak your diet as you age - CNN.com	2014/05/20	Tuesday May 20 07:12:33 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Cynthia Sass is a registered dietitian with master's degrees in both nutrition science and public health, and the author of "S.A.S.S! Yourself Slim: Conquer Cravings, Drop Pounds and Lose Inches." Connect with Cynthia on Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest.  (CNN) -- As you get older, it's important to make small changes to your diet to protect your long-term health. Here are seven nutrients to zero in on after turning 50. Vitamin D Why you need it: Scientific journals have been bursting at the seams in recent years with new research about the importance of vitamin D, and according the data, the vast majority of women aren't getting enough. One recent study found that adults with the lowest blood vitamin D levels were about twice as likely to die from any cause compared to those with the highest levels. Other studies have linked adequate intakes to lower rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, depression, certain cancers, and brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. This key nutrient is also tied to enhanced immunity, muscle functioning, and injury prevention (pretty impressive, huh?). Vitamin D's nickname is the "sunshine vitamin" because exposure to the sun's ultraviolet rays triggers its production in the body, but you can't rely on the sun as your sole source. Your location, cloud cover, smog, time of day and year, and sunscreen use all affect your UV exposure and vitamin D production. How to get it: Some of the best natural food sources include wild salmon, whole eggs (the D is in the yolk), and mushrooms, and it's in fortified foods like dairy, but it can be difficult to eat enough of these foods to meet your needs, so a supplement may be your best bet. Health.com: 12 ways to get your daily Vitamin D How much is safe: To identify the right amount to take, get your blood level tested. Based on the results, your doctor can recommend the proper daily dose. Calcium Why you need it: Bone density declines more rapidly after 50, and one in three women over this age will experience a bone fracture. Research shows that in the first years after menopause, women may lose 3 to 5% of their bone mass annually, and increases in calcium intakes generally don't offset the losses. Calcium is also required for muscle contractions, so this mineral allows you to get the most from every workout. It's also needed for nerve function, and helps maintain your body's acid/base balance, so there are plenty of reasons to strive to hit the suggested mark. How to get it: While dairy may be your first thought, there are also several plant-based sources, including dark leafy greens, beans and lentils, nuts, and dried figs. How much is safe: If you choose to use a supplement, just be sure not to go overboard. The recommended daily calcium intake for women over 50 is 1,200 mg per day, but the maximum advised limit, from both food and supplements combined, from age 51 on is 2,000 mg per day. I've seen plenty of women exceed that amount (sometimes unknowingly, sometimes because they mistakenly believe more is better), and getting too much can be risky, with potential side effects including kidney problems, kidney stones, and calcium deposits in soft tissues. High calcium intakes can also lead to constipation, and interfere with the absorption of iron and zinc, and recently, excess calcium has been linked to a higher risk of heart disease. Talk to your doctor or dietitian to be sure you're striking the right balance. Health.com: 14 surprising facts about healthy bones  Probiotics Why you need them: Probiotics have been shown to boost immunity, improve digestive and skin health, lower "bad" LDL cholesterol, fight gum disease, and enhance weight control, so there's plenty to benefit from for women over 50. How to get them: While foods like yogurt, kefir, kimchi, and sauerkraut contain probiotics, it may be difficult to consume enough of these "friendly bacteria" on a daily basis through food alone. How much is safe: If you opt for a supplement, ask your doc or dietitian for a recommended brand and amount. There's currently no standard dose for probiotics, like those that have been established for vitamins and minerals; and while probiotics are generally considered to be safe, your personal medical history should be taken into account before you pop a pill. Omega-3 fatty acids Why you need them: The omega-3s DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) are essential fatty acids that have been tied to vision and brain protection, healthy hair and skin, improved circulation, reduced muscle soreness, a lower risk of heart disease and depression, and a reduction in inflammation, which is a known trigger of aging and disease. This remarkable list of benefits makes getting sufficient amounts of these good fats particularly important in your 50s. How to get them: Fatty fish like salmon and sardines are rich sources, but a dislike of seafood or concerns about mercury may interfere with getting enough. And while plant-based foods like flaxseeds and walnuts contain a type of omega-3 called alpha-linolenic acid or ALA, your body only converts a small percentage of this form into EPA and DHA -- the two types that the vast majority of the research has focused on. How much is safe: If you choose to take a supplement that provides DHA and EPA (vegan options are available), it's important to note that there's currently no standard daily dose for healthy adults. Many experts recommend 1,000 mg of DHA/EPA combined, the amount advised for those with heart disease, and like some of the other nutrients I've mentioned, it's important not to go overboard. Emerging research shows that too much omega-3 may weaken immunity, and excess intakes have been linked to bleeding, especially when combined with medications or supplements that like omega-3s, also have a blood thinning effect. Once again, to pinpoint the amount that's right for you, rely on advice from your personal health care providers. Health.com: Good fats, bad fats: How to choose  Magnesium Why you need it: Getting enough of this key "maintenance mineral" which is involved in more than 300 bodily reactions can keep your energy soaring and allow you to look and feel like you've turned back the clock. Magnesium helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, preserves strong bones, and slashes stroke and heart disease risk. It also helps regulate blood sugar levels and promotes normal blood pressure, but many women fall short of the recommended intake. How to get it: Good food sources include spinach, almonds, cashews, black beans, quinoa, and pumpkin, sesame, and sunflower seeds. How much is safe: If you opt for a supplement, look for one with no more than 100% of the daily value (400 mg), unless your doctor or dietician has advised differently. Too much magnesium can trigger nausea, diarrhea, appetite loss, muscle weakness, breathing problems, irregular heartbeat, and dangerously low blood pressure. Fiber Why you need it: Fiber-rich meals result in a steadier rise in blood sugar and a lower insulin response, as well as a slower rate of digestion and absorption, which keeps you fuller longer and delays the return of hunger. It also keeps you "regular" by helping your digestive system stay in tip top shape, and getting enough fiber is also a smart weight control strategy. Research has shown that for every gram of fiber we eat, we eliminate about seven calories. That means if you eat 35 grams a day, you'll essentially "cancel out" 245 calories -- a savings that could effectively stave off age-related weight gain. How to get it: To bolster your intake, rely on foods that are naturally fiber-rich, like fruits and vegetables (especially those with an edible skin and/or seeds or tough stalk) beans and lentils, and small portions of nuts and whole grains, including oats, whole grain rice, quinoa, and barley. Health.com: 20 best foods for fiber  Water Why you need it: Water, your body's most important nutrient, is required for every bodily process, and you lose water from your body each minute of the day. Replacing those losses adequately can help you reap the benefits of water, including optimized mood and metabolism, as well as better digestive health (especially if you're stepping up your fiber game), and glowing skin. Good old H2O is also linked to weight control. A recent study found that when middle-aged and older adults drank two cups of water prior to eating a meal, they ate between 75 and 90 fewer calories. Another 12-week study found that adults who gulped extra water lost about 30% more weight following the same diet compared to those who drank less. And a small German study found that drinking two liters of water a day could result in burning up to 95 extra calories, an effect that could help fend off age-related weight gain. How to get (more of) it: According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), women ages 19 and over need 2.7 liters of total fluid per day (more than 11 cups). About 20% of your fluid needs are met by food, but that still leaves nearly nine cups based on the IOM's guidelines. While other beverages may count as fluid, water is the best way to meet your daily needs, so strive for at least 16 ounces four times a day. This article originally appeared on Health.com.

Suicide prevention advocate Christine O'Hagan shared her story with CNN iReport after reading Erin Schwantner's recent essay, I was an accomplice to my brother's suicide. This essay was compiled from her iReport submission and entries from her blog, Second Chances.  (CNN) -- I am a mother, a wife, a college graduate, an executive, a marathon runner and a member of the church choir. And I am mentally ill. I attempted suicide in November 2012 and was hospitalized. I have not attempted to kill myself since, nor did I previously. But that's not because I don't have the urge to. I used to be that person who judged those who took "the easy way out." I felt particular disdain for adults who would do this, leaving children and loved ones behind. For two years, I managed to swallow my self-hatred and continue to trudge through life unhappy and sick, having no clue this was not normal. Going public with mental illness: Share your story  It had been a rough and challenging time. Work was overwhelming. I had just changed jobs and moved myself and my two girls to a new town. My relationship was ending. I was tired and lonely. I knew I needed to get help, but in my mind, the repercussions for doing so were so great, I couldn't risk giving any clues to anyone that I was in crisis. I was afraid I would lose my job, career, my children, and that my family would turn their back on me for being "crazy." I started to hope and pray for a fatal disease or accident that would take me soon. I didn't care how physically painful it would be, I just needed to go. If a car wreck or cancer took me, my children would get sympathy, and my parents would have help and a reason to remember me fondly. They wouldn't have anger, shame and stigma hanging over their heads for the rest of their lives. I tried to talk myself out of wanting to die. "Think of the positives," I would tell myself, over and over. "Be thankful for what you have." "Look at the angelic faces of your children who love you and need you here." I started running marathons and boxing to keep me busy, but it didn't help ... at least not for long. That last day of November, I had the sudden realization that every breath was more painful than the last. I was in the darkest place I have ever been, and I saw no way out. The pain had to stop. I'd been through some painful moments, but nothing was comparable. I survived skin cancer as a pre-teen and live with lupus. I gave birth without pain medicine or epidurals. I've been hurt emotionally and mentally and never felt anything like this before. So when my children left for school for the day, I called in sick to work then said what I thought would be a final prayer for peace. Mother of suicide teen: "Make them talk about their feelings" I had thought about killing myself a million times before. I had researched it extensively. I knew what would be most effective, the least painful. Alone in my kitchen that morning, the plan quickly began to take shape. The end was in sight. Then, my cell phone rang. "You are my Sunshine" filled the room -- my daughter's ring tone. The zombie in me broke. I managed to call for help, and began to lose consciousness as the ambulance arrived. I intentionally don't go into the details of my attempt because I find it to be triggering to others who may be on the brink of an attempt. It has been shown to be dangerous to read or learn of others' methods. Also, I do not want to be disrespectful to my family by sharing the literal details. There were several times I wondered why I survived. I was so angry and devastated when I woke up in the hospital. But those feelings quickly passed when I saw the look on my best friend's face and realized that I was really sick. I was an accomplice to my brother's suicide My official diagnosis was generalized anxiety disorder, major depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. I discovered that there is a legacy of depression in my family. Once I was released, I began to see a therapist and a psychiatrist who prescribed the right combination of medication that has worked for me ever since. My now-husband's unrelenting support and my family's love have gotten me through the past two years. None of them judged me and I needed that to compensate for my self-judgment. My children kept me functional during my "zombie period" when my medication and therapy was just starting to work. I HAD to get up and move for them. They still needed their mom. Even if I was broken. Other non-medication strategies that help me with my illnesses are exercise (I truly believe running has saved my life); sleep (no less than 7 hours a night); and setting aside one day a week when I do not schedule client appointments, answer work e-mails or phone calls, or volunteer for work-related activities. No exceptions or guilt allowed. This is for my health and I get that now. What doesn't help? Hearing people say if I had a "positive attitude" or would "stop being so negative" or maybe just "believed in God a little more/ better/ faithfully, etc." I would be absolutely fine. During a depressive episode, all this does is make me feel hopeless and like more of a failure. Now, all these months later, I understand what I could and should have done differently. I could have asked for help. I should have reached out sooner. I might have recognized that what I was feeling was biological and not my fault. This was not a weakness or a character flaw. Speaking publicly about my attempt, healing and my occasional trips and falls on the way to a healthy future has saved me. I am very open about how I felt and what I did. I was afraid I would lose my career, or even my children, for speaking so openly about my illness, but it has brought nothing but positive returns so far. I have an overwhelming sense that I survived for a reason. I want to tell my story to help people, so no one else feels like I did. I want to help the people left behind, so they don't feel responsible for their loved one's death. I want to speak for those who completed suicide and let people know how much pain they were in. The pain and the disease were to blame. There are days when I wake up wondering if I will be OK today, and days I wish I hadn't woken up at all. But still no days that are like that terrible, numb, bloody day back in November 2012. I believe wholeheartedly there will be a difference made in how society views mental illness. And I pray it is in my lifetime. If you are in crisis, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). They have trained counselors available 24/7 to provide free, confidential help.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/07/health/time-avoid-dying/index.html	health	6 ways to avoid dying before your time - CNN.com	2014/05/07	Wednesday May 7 07:08:50 EDT 2014	(TIME.com) -- With so many of the deaths each year from around the world directly related to poor health choices we make, world health leaders have set a goal of lowering the number of preventable deaths by 25% from 2010 rates by 2025. That would save 37 million lives over 15 years. Reporting in the journal Lancet, public health experts note that the way to prevent those deaths aren't surprising. But acting on those strategies will take individual and political will. Here's how the experts hope to do it. Not smoking The UN General Assembly set a target of cutting smoking around the world by 30% by 2025. Already, higher-income nations that have adopted smoking bans in public places and instituted tobacco taxes have seen drops in smoking rates, although residents in lower income nations continue to light up at high rates. Limiting excessive drinking While moderate amounts of alcohol have been linked to some health benefits, overindulging can increase the risk of certain cancers and liver disease, as well as contribute to high blood pressure. Educating people about the risks of excessive drinking, as well as instituting taxes on alcoholic products have been somewhat successful in curbing abuse. Cutting back on salt High sodium diets can increase blood pressure and contribute to heart disease and stroke, and in many developed countries, people eat several times the amount the salt their bodies need. In the U.S., the average American consumes about 800mg more salt every day than health experts consider acceptable. Promoting alternatives, such as the citric acid in lemons, to satisfy the need for salt, can help to bring sodium consumption down. CDC: 5 things cause two-thirds of U.S. deaths Getting blood pressure under control Lack of exercise and high sodium diets contribute to hypertension, and uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to stroke and heart disease. Monitoring blood pressure with regular screenings, and treating elevated levels with changes in diet and exercise, or medications if necessary, are the most effective ways to address this risk factor. Address diabetes Closely tied to the obesity epidemic that now affects developing as well as developed nations, diabetes can increase the risk of heart disease, kidney disease and other conditions that can shorten life. Studies show that lifestyle changes incorporating healthy diets low in sugar and physical activity can be as effective as medications in keeping blood sugar levels in check. Reducing obesity The global growth in girth is tied to a number of factors, from the proliferation of processed and high calorie foods, to the shift toward sedentary lifestyles. Addressing obesity alone could also have beneficial effects in lowering other chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and hypertension. Public health campaigns highlighting the high calorie content of fast and processed foods, and programs that provide access to fresh fruits and vegetables, including in schools, could be important steps in turning the tide of the global obesity epidemic.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/12/health/brain-mind-reading/index.html	health	Scan a brain, read a mind? - CNN.com	2014/04/12	Saturday Apr 12 09:13:17 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- What we write online may be intercepted, filtered and publicized, but we'd like to think that the thoughts and images in our heads are totally private. For better or worse, science may change that. Over the last few years, researchers have made significant strides in decoding our thoughts based on brain activity. How this would work is still at the very early stages of development. But, given what we can already do, it's not a huge leap to imagine that one day we could read the words of people's internal streams of thought, said Jack Gallant, a prominent neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley. "I think decoding the little person in your brain -- we could do that today if we had a good enough method of measuring your brain activity," Gallant said. Gallant predicts that in 50 years, thought-reading will be commonplace. We'll be wearing "Google Hats," he envisions, that are continuously decoding our thoughts. Such a wonder-cap might transmit and even translate our thoughts into foreign languages. But Dr. Josef Parvizi, a Stanford University neurologist who also studies the relationship between brain and mind, is much more skeptical. "In order to really read thoughts with methods that are noninvasive, we have a long way to go," he said. "I think it is unwise and simply false to give the general public the impression that we are about to be able to read minds." What you need to read thoughts There are several limitations on "mind reading" directly from the brain, Gallant said. You need good mathematical models of brain function and high-speed computing. But the biggest challenge right now is measuring brain activity. Scientists can measure electrical activity with EEG (electroencephalography) and changes in blood oxygen use with fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). But these are really crude measurements of what's happening inside the brain. EEG is a two-dimensional, limited signal from the brain. And fMRI is like measuring the total electricity usage in your office at specific times to figure out what's going on at everyone's desk, Gallant said. That wouldn't tell you what any particular person is working on; it's just a rough overall description of changes. "The most optimistic estimates are that you can recover one one-millionth of the information that's available in the brain at any given point in time," Gallant said. "It's probably smaller than that. So, where we are today is just measuring a pale shadow of what you could potentially measure, if you had a better measurement technology." Meanwhile, Parvizi's lab explores the brain with a completely different technique, making use of electrodes implanted in the brains of patients with severe epilepsy to do direct neural recordings at the brain's surface. His group wants to know the specific functions of different brain areas so when surgeons cut out parts responsible for seizures, they know what to avoid. This method, however, has so far not extracted the actual content of thoughts and memories, and may not be generalizable to non-epileptic patients. What we can do now Despite these limitations of brain activity measurement, scientists have already been able to achieve remarkable results. For instance, using fMRI scans, scientists can reconstruct a face that a person is viewing, as reported in a March 2014 study in the journal Neuroimage. The study was led by Alan Cowen, then an undergraduate at Yale University, who now studies with Gallant in graduate school. Researchers analyzed how subjects responded to 300 faces while receiving fMRI scans, creating a statistical "library" of the way the brain reacts to facial images. They then used a computer algorithm to generate a mathematical description of the faces based on brain activity patterns. Then, researchers scanned the six participants again while they viewed a new set of faces. By comparing the fMRI data from the 300 faces to the new scans, scientists were able to digitally draw the second set of faces that the participants saw based on brain activity. The computer-reconstructed faces were not exact, but people were able to identify them, and researchers could sufficiently compare the pixel information between the reconstructions and originals by computer, accurately matching them between 60% and 70% of the time. Marvin Chun, professor of psychology at Yale who co-authored the study, said it could have applications for studying disorders where perception of faces is impaired, such as prosopagnosia and autism. "We're very excited about it, because any increasing ability to read out activity from the brain and map it onto something useful like faces is going to have very broad usage scientifically," Chun said. This research was inspired by studies that Gallant's group had done on determining which photographs people saw based on fMRI scans. Gallant and colleagues have also demonstrated this with videos; their 2011 study in Current Biology used fMRI and computational models to reconstruct movie clips that people viewed. Even dreams may be knowable. Scientists led by Tomoyasu Horikawa at ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories, Kyoto, published a report last year in the journal Science suggesting it is possible to decode dreams based on brain activity in slumbering subjects, although this is also early stage research. Such feats have a certain magical quality. But they still involve large, bulky machinery that can capture only a small slice of our conscious experience. Can brain scientists read your mind? Scientists are also looking at how two brains can communicate with each other. A group at the University of Washington demonstrated last year that by sending brain signals over the Internet, one scientist could control another scientist's hand motion. But the recipient of the signal was not actively interpreting it; true two-way brain communication has been achieved in mice not but yet humans. Neither Gallant nor Parvizi are primarily interested in decoding thoughts. Their fundamental goals involve understanding how the brain does what it does. Nonetheless, their research has generated a lot of interest, and also hype about mind reading that is concerning to Parvizi. "I don't think it serves science well, and I don't think it makes the general public appreciate how difficult it is to really understand the operation of the human brain," Parvizi said. The future  Beyond the novelty of "thinking" an e-mail, there are other important applications to this line of research. Thought-directed wheelchairs, artificial limbs and other assistance devices would be a huge benefit to people with paralysis and other disabilities. Scientists are making strides in this area in small studies. Gallant's group is working on modeling how the brain responds to language and represents language in your mind. Chun is working on studying attention, looking at what happens when people's minds are wandering out of "the zone" of experience. Then there's the problem of memory, which Parvizi is working on: How your brain retrieves memories from the past. "We can accurately decode that the patient is retrieving memories but we cannot decipher the memory content," he said.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/02/health/brain-maps/index.html	health	New maps may hold clues to brain mysteries - CNN.com	2014/04/02	Wednesday Apr 2 06:15:08 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- The many connections between different parts of the brain have no street signs or trail markers. But in order to better explore this complicated organ that enables us to be conscious, thinking, alert beings, scientists need maps. Big maps. Two studies released Wednesday in the journal Nature showcase brain maps that could have implications for understanding both healthy and impaired brains. One study reveals the most complete map ever of how parts of the brain are connected in a mouse. The other illuminates the developing human brain in terms of genetic expression -- specifically, which genes are responsible for generating different types of neurons, and how brain circuits are formed. The leaders of both studies likened their respective brain maps to "Google Maps." The studies represent different, complementary ways of understanding the brain. This research was published one year after President Barack Obama announced the $100 million BRAIN Initiative, which "aims to help researchers find new ways to treat, cure, and even prevent brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury." The mouse brain, as never before The issue of brain connectivity has been an important research topic for the last century, said Hongkui Zeng, senior director of research science at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle. But it has been hard to gain insights about the entire brain by combining individual studies, because particular researchers have focused on different parts of the brain. "Now is the time for us to generate a comprehensive map in a systematic way because of the advancements of imaging technology and advancements of computing power," she said. Zeng and colleagues took on this daunting task. They standardized data about connectivity in the whole brain of a mouse. Full study from Nature Researchers say their map is the first ever detailing the connectivity of neurons in a whole brain of any mammal. Scientists have made this vast expanse of data -- hundreds of terabytes -- publicly available. "This kind of database would facilitate the study of many, many different researchers in almost any area of brain research," Zeng said. There are several important uses for this brain map. Scientists looking at disease models could compare Zeng's group's descriptions of brain wiring to brains that are impaired in various ways, to see what effects different conditions have on brain connectivity. This could open new avenues in the study of Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, autism, schizophrenia and other brain abnormalities. "This really sets the stage for us now to be able to compare a normal animal versus a disease model, to gain fuller understanding of what is going on in the diseased brain," she said. Researchers who are interested in finding out what functions specific brain regions have could use this map to see how different areas are connected. Looking at the circuitry of the brain could help guide their studies, Zeng said. Scientists building computational models of the brain, seeking to understand how networks operate in the brain, can also benefit from looking at these maps. It's important to note that mouse and human brains are similarly structured, but they are nowhere near the same in size or capability. With about 86 billion neurons, the human brain contains more than 1,000 times more of these cells than the mouse brain. Our brains are also 2,000 times bigger than a mouse brain, Zeng said. Fundamental insights about brain circuitry and impairment often begin with rodent models before being expanded to humans. But we need to also explore the human brain for a fuller picture of behavior and disease. Zeng and colleagues are in talks with the Human Brain Project, the European initiative that aims to computationally simulate the entire human brain. The Nature paper on connectivity will be "an important foundation for them," Zeng said. Human brain development While the mouse brain study showed connections, a second study from scientists at the Allen Institute explored genetics in the developing human brain. This report unveils a map showing where various genes are turned off and on in a fetus in the middle of pregnancy, which may help explore the origins of brain problems. "We can really use that now to pinpoint where a set of genes associated with a disease may have a common action," said senior study author Ed Lein. Full study from Nature This is the first big study incorporating data from the BrainSpan Atlas of the Developing Human Brain, an effort aiming to study the role of gene expression in the brain during all of human development, including adulthood. To generate the genetic blueprint of the developing brain in this study, scientists used four human fetus brains, between 15 and 21 weeks gestation, which had been donated. This is thought to be a critical period for the emergence of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, Lein said. Impacts to a brain region called the neocortex as it is forming could have long-lasting effects, he said. Researchers used information from the maps to look at genes that previously had been linked to autism in the developing brain. They found that genes associated with autism tended to be particularly active in newly generated excitatory neurons of the cortex. These cells send information from one part of the brain to another, he said. "This provides a place to focus more research," Lein said. "It suggests on the one hand that these genes may be (activated) prenatally, and on the other hand we actually have a place to look in the brain, which is the development and maturation of these new neurons." Taking the new maps, researchers studying other developmental disorders can take a similar approach. This map can also reveal ways in which humans are genetically different from other species. For one thing, it's important to understand the differences between mice and humans, since mice are used so often in biomedical research and neuroscience. But what about what makes us genetically special? Lein and colleagues found that genes that appear unique to humans tend to be expressed particularly in the frontal cortex, which is a part of the neocortex, and is responsible for many higher cognitive capabilities. This also may provide clues that future research can follow. READ: How your brain makes moral judgments CNN's Alex Mooney contributed to this report.

When the community organizer walks down her block in Chicago's Englewood neighborhood, she is reminded of the officer who was shot there. Violence even surrounded her high school. Shots constantly rang out around the streets by the school building. Her junior year, a police car crashed right in front of her class. "The violence is something we deal with daily and it's a real struggle," Morris said. "You get scared and youth here are angry when their friends are shot. The violence really does something to a person." "It's sometimes bigger than the crime itself," Morris said. "It affects you more, maybe even more than the person injured, because it lingers." Studies show her experience is shared by thousands of Americans who live in tough urban areas. A growing number of programs treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in war veterans. But far fewer treat Americans who suffer from the PTSD that comes with their ZIP code. And this kind of PTSD may be affecting even more people. PTSD can directly hurt a person's brain by messing with the amygdala -- the part of the brain that triggers a chemical to release to help you decide between "fight or flight" in a threatening situation. If someone is exposed to prolonged, repetitive, or extreme trauma, the amygdala stays in alert mode. And the neurons, the pathways to this part of the brain, lose their ability to recover. A person's memory becomes corrupted like a bad computer hard drive and it can hurt a person's ability to separate out new experiences and determine whether they are safe or dangerous. The longer a person stays in the hyper-vigilant mode, the greater the chance of permanent damage. In a child, damage can be magnified and lead to problems like dissociative identity disorder. Chicago anti-violence program didn't do much, audit finds A recent study that ran in the American Journal of Orthopsychiatry found that you don't even need a direct experience of a violent crime to be hurt by it. When there is a perception that there is disorder in a particular neighborhood, it causes some residents to suffer from PTSD. While the overall rate of violent crime has gone down in the United States -- so much that some sociologists call this the era of the "Great Crime Decline" -- there are still pockets where violent crime is so concentrated that neighbors can't escape it. After interviewing some 8,000 people in Atlanta, Emory University professor of psychiatry Dr. Kerry Ressler and his colleagues say that they are seeing evidence of higher rates of PTSD in this urban population than in war veterans. "It's outrageous. This is -- well, it is not an epidemic of violence, that is not the right term for this. This is a pandemic," Ressler said. An epidemic is concentrated in a particular region. A pandemic is spread over a wider geographic area and impacts a much larger population. "We are seeing the same (high instances of PTSD) in cities like D.C. and Chicago and L.A." In surveying patients picked at random from Atlanta's Grady Memorial Hospital -- one of the busiest Level 1 trauma centers in the United States -- Ressler and his team found that at least half knew someone who had been murdered. Some two-thirds said they had been victims of a violent assault. A third had been sexually assaulted. This wide range of trauma experience meant that 32% of this population suffered PTSD symptoms. In continuing these surveys, the team wants a better scientific understanding about the lasting consequences of living in violent neighborhoods, Ressler said. "We find you don't only lose a generation to this violence," in terms of the people who are directly hurt, he said. Instead, "you are losing multiple generations (to the violence) in these war-torn inner cities." "With pandemic levels of disorder there are serious consequences," Ressler says. The violence "makes it harder for kids to go through school or to play by the rules. It makes it harder for a parent to get a job or avoid addiction to drugs." Community leaders often talk about education being key to lifting people from poverty, but Ressler believes that won't be enough. "It is important to have programs like Head Start to help begin to break the cycle of poverty with education, but if we are not doing something for people's mental health, we may not be able to change this cycle," Ressler said. The chances that young men who experience trauma in their neighborhood will end up in jail are astronomically high, studies show.  Studies have also shown a high correlation between neighborhood disorder and physical abuse. There are further cognitive consequences as well. A study by Andrew Papachristos, a Yale sociology professor, found that some neighborhoods in Chicago have seen high violent crime rates for decades. Frequent violence has dramatically limited academic achievement in these neighborhoods. Exposure to violence is associated with cognitive and emotional stress that can lead to reductions in working memory. Another study looking at local violence in Chicago found that children who lived within 1,500 feet of a homicide had lower verbal and impulse control scores a week after the incident happened. Tests of older students showed similar results. She survived a standoff with a gunman -- could you? This concept that "deteriorated" neighborhoods have an impact on one's mental health is not new. At least 70 years ago, Chicago school researchers Robert E.L. Faris and H. Warren Dunham went through 30,000 psychiatric hospital admission records. They found high rates of substance abuse and even schizophrenia in these neighborhoods. Later studies found that high rates of depression were also common. One compounding problem is that there is an overall element of mistrust in rougher neighborhoods, studies show. People feel powerless to change their overall circumstances; therefore, PTSD -- which carries symptoms of hyper-vigilance, social separation and avoidance -- may amplify that mistrust. In an absence of a national public policy to address this serious problem, there are a handful of nonprofits that have overcome some of that neighborhood mistrust. Cure Violence, one of those nonprofits, takes a public health approach to violence prevention. Epidemiologist Dr. Gary Slutkin started the program after returning from Africa, where he had been fighting tuberculosis and AIDS epidemics. When he returned to Chicago, he saw similar patterns in outbreaks of violence and thought an epidemiological approach may stop it. Cure Violence concentrates its efforts on those who are at highest risk to cause violence. Workers living in the tougher Chicago neighborhoods listen for trouble. When they hear rumblings about a fight brewing, they intervene, talk to involved parties and try to mediate the problem before it escalates into violence. They also work with at-risk individuals to develop a plan to reject violence, whether that be through anger management, job training or substance abuse programs. "If we can stop the violence and stop people's exposure to the violence early, we reduce its impact from spreading through the community," said Charlie Ransford, Cure Violence spokesman. Morris, meanwhile, is turning her experience growing up in a tough neighborhood into motivation to organize it. She's led highly visible protests to raise awareness of the consequences of violence. "I always believe in hope, and I feel as an organizer that we've got to reinvest in these communities so that more of us won't have to continue to live this way," Morris said. Mother loses both sons in 19 days to gun violence Ressler hopes there will be some kind of public policy initiative to address the consequences of violence before it is too late. "By having a lifetime of trauma baggage and coming from multiple generations with trauma baggage, this is hard to overcome without help," Ressler said. There will be trouble, he said, "if we don't start paying attention soon." More from the series: How you make moral judgments This is your brain on knitting

The actor brought along some of his artwork to share Saturday with the graduates of the Maharishi University of Management in Fairfield, Iowa. And the actor offered the Class of 2014 inspiring words about life and their future. "Like many of you, I was concerned about going out into the world and doing something bigger than myself, until someone smarter than myself made me realize that there is nothing bigger than myself," the "Dumb and Dumber" star said. "My soul is not contained within the limits of my body; my body is contained within the limitlessness of my soul." The funnyman got serious when discussing his father and the things he learned from him. "My father could have been a great comedian, but he didn't believe that that was possible for him, and so he made a conservative choice," Carrey said. "Instead he got a safe job as an accountant." All of that fell apart, the actor said, when his dad lost his job and the family fell on hard times. "I learned many great lessons from my father, not the least of which, was that you can fail at what you don't want, so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love," he said. The speech received a rousing reaction from the graduating students of the institution, which according to its website is a place where "all students and faculty ... practice the Transcendental Meditation technique." Carrey jokingly thanked, "The trustees, the administrators, the faculty of MUM for creating an institution worthy of Maharishi's ideals of education as well as enabling the students through transcendental meditation and ancient vedic knowledge to slack off twice a day for an hour and a half." He also received an honorary degree of doctor of fine arts during the ceremony.

Syfy seems to be taking that maxim to heart, announcing its own Shark Week of sorts (Sorry, Discovery), pegged to the upcoming release of "Sharknado 2: The Second One." "Sharknado 2," is, of course, a sequel to last year's super-buzzy, low-budget television movie, "Sharknado." "Sharknado Week" will air July 26 through August 2; Sharknado 2 premieres Wed. July 30. Also in the programming block? Roger Corman's "Sharktopus vs. Pteracuda" (August 2), Mega Shark vs. Mecha Shark (July 26), and "Sharkmania: The Top 15 Biggest Baddest Bloodiest Bites" (July 27). No one could forget the plot of "Sharknado 2," but here's Syfy's description once again: "A freak weather system turns its deadly fury on New York City, unleashing a Sharknado on the population and its most cherished iconic sites -- and only Fin (Ian Ziering) and April (Tara Reid) can save the Big Apple. The movie, directed by Anthony C. Ferrante from a screenplay by Thunder Levin, also stars Mark McGrath, Kari Wuhrer, Vivica A. Fox and Judah Friedlander, with cameo appearances including Kelly Osbourne, Judd Hirsch, Perez Hilton, Matt Lauer, Al Roker, Andy Dick, Robert Klein, Sandra "Pepa" Denton, Biz Markie, Downtown Julie Brown, Richard Kind and Kurt Angle, among others."

Sure, it doesn't happen to everybody, but when it does, expect good times from America's favorite guest -- just ask some karaoke fans or kickball players. This time, it was a bachelor party in Charleston, South Carolina. Deadspin has the video and offers this background via one of the attendees: "At one point during dinner at a steakhouse, one guy goes to the bathroom downstairs and sees Bill Murray sitting with some people with a fishing vest on," said the partygoer, identified only as Stephen. "We talked to the waiter to see if we could send him some drinks, to which Bill declined. "One of my buddies then went down and asked if he'd come up and say a few words for (the groom) EJ and got a 'No thanks.' My buddy comes back up dejected and tells us it's not going to happen. Two minutes later, Bill f***ing Murray walks into the room and gives this speech." Speaking to the 20 members of the bachelor party, Murray offered this advice on finding "The One." "Take that person and travel around the world," Murray said. "Buy a plane ticket for the two of you to travel all around the world, and go to places that are hard to go to and hard to get out of. And if when you come back to JFK, when you land in JFK, and you're still in love with that person, get married at the airport." Murray was most recently seen in Wes Anderson's film "The Grand Budapest Hotel."  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/showbiz/music/rolling-stones-tour-return/index.html	entertainment	Rolling Stones on tour 2 months after death of Jagger's girlfriend - CNN.com	2014/05/27	Tuesday May 27 10:13:42 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Ladies and gentlemen, the Rolling Stones are back on tour. The "world's greatest rock 'n' roll band" resumed its #StonesOnFire trek, part of its 50th-anniversary travels around the globe, with a show Monday night in Oslo, Norway. The group's tour had been put on hold since the March 17 death of Mick Jagger's girlfriend, fashion designer L'Wren Scott. Scott's death, which was ruled a suicide, stunned Jagger, who had been with the designer and former model since 2003. "I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way. We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves. She had great presence and her talent was much admired, not least by me," he said in a statement two months ago. Scott left her $9 million estate to Jagger, according to the late fashion designer's will. Though she had reportedly been having financial difficulties, a representative for Scott said, "The figures quoted in the media regarding the financial status of LS Fashion Limited are not only highly misleading and inaccurate but also extremely hurtful and disrespectful to the memory of L'Wren Scott." The Stones were in Australia at the time of her death, and the band canceled seven shows there and in New Zealand. The shows have been rescheduled for October and November, according to the Stones' official site. The Stones' Oslo set list included "Jumpin' Jack Flash," "All Down the Line," "Let's Spend the Night Together," "Emotional Rescue" and a version of "You Can't Always Get What You Want" accompanied by the Edvard Grieg Youth Choir.

From her books to her orations, Angelou used language to stir her audiences and reach into their hearts. Here is a sampling of some of her most powerful speeches: 1) Presidential Inauguration Ceremony, 1993 She became the second poet in history to speak at a presidential inauguration -- after Robert Frost, who spoke at John F. Kennedy's inaugural -- when she read her poem "On the Pulse of Morning" at the swearing-in of President Bill Clinton in 1993. 2) 2013 National Book Awards Angelou was selected to receive the Literarian Award for Outstanding Service to the American Literary Community. She sang and offered moving words of gratitude. 3) The funeral of Coretta Scott King, 2008 The writer sang and spoke at the homegoing service for the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King -- calling her "born of flesh and destined to become iron." Angelou was active in the civil rights movement and knew the Kings. 4) The Children's Defense Fund National Conference, 2012 Angelou shared one of her poems as the keynote speaker at the Children's Defense Fund National Conference held in Cincinnati in July 2012. Her words live on.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/showbiz/movies/robert-de-niro-gay-father/index.html	entertainment	De Niro opens up about his gay father - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 01:01:36 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Robert De Niro says it was his "responsibility" to make a documentary about his father, artist Robert De Niro Sr., he told Out magazine in an interview. De Niro's father was a gay man who divorced De Niro's mother when the actor was a child. The elder De Niro is the subject of a new documentary, "Remembering the Artist: Robert De Niro, Sr.," which premieres on HBO June 9. (HBO, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.) In a chat with Out, De Niro says that though he and his father weren't close -- he grew up with his mother -- the senior De Niro had a profound influence on his actor son. De Niro wants to pay tribute in the documentary, partly for the sake of his own children. "We were not the type of father and son who played baseball together, as you can surmise. But we had a connection," he said. "I wasn't with him a lot, because my mother and he were separated and divorced. ... But my father wasn't a bad father, or absent. He was absent in some ways. He was very loving. He adored me ... as I do my kids." De Niro Sr. was an abstract expressionist painter who was part of an art community that also produced Jackson Pollock, Willem De Kooning and Mark Rothko. As his son notes, when De Niro Sr. had his studio in downtown Manhattan, an area now full of multimillion-dollar apartments, the area was "Siberia." De Niro Sr. died in 1993 and his son has maintained his studio in New York's SoHo neighborhood ever since. "This space is here, and in 20 years, people won't know what a real space like this will be unless it was in a museum and they recreated it," he said. He had the contents catalogued and has kept them intact. He says he was only dimly aware of his father's sexuality growing up. "I was not aware, much, of it. I wish we had spoken about it much more. My mother didn't want to talk about things in general, and you're not interested when you're a certain age," he said. But both his father and mother gave him the drive to succeed, he added. "When I was young, I wasn't afraid of being told 'No,'" he said. "I tell my kids, I tell everyone, 'If you don't go, you never know.' I didn't take it as rejection. Certain things are stacked against you. You're coming out of nowhere, starting out  that's part of the excitement of it in a way, too." In the film, De Niro also reads from his father's diaries, which he's still working through, he said. He may share more of them publicly -- "That's part of his legacy, too," he said -- though he wants to talk to others first. But the important thing, he said, is getting the whole story out. "You can't hide anything. That's the whole point -- the truth. That's what people are attracted to," the actor said. "I should have done this 10 years earlier, but I'm glad I did it now."  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/23/showbiz/celebrity-news-gossip/tupac-last-words-rs/index.html	entertainment	Tupac's final words revealed by police officer on scene of murder - CNN.com	2014/05/23	Friday May 23 02:21:49 EDT 2014	(RollingStone.com) -- The first police officer at the scene of Tupac Shakur's 1996 drive-by murder has revealed the last words spoken by the late rap legend. And they're not exactly peaceful. "He looked at me, and he took a breath to get the words out, and he opened his mouth," says Chris Carroll, a retired sergeant with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, in a new feature with Vegas Seven. "And then the words came out: 'F**k you.'" Rolling Stone: 50 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs of All Time Shakur was shot multiple times on September 7th, 1996. After leaving a boxing match with former Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight, the rapper and his bodyguards got into a scuffle with 21-year-old Crips gang member Orlando Anderson in the lobby of the MGM Grand casino. Carroll, who worked with the city's bike patrol unit, had also been watching the same Mike Tyson fight, but was unaware of the brawl taking place in the lobby. Later, a white Cadillac pulled up beside Knight and Shakur while they were stopped at a traffic light and one man began shooting out of the back window. Carroll was the first officer to respond to the grisly scene. "I grab the car door and I'm trying to open it, but I can't get it open," he says. "[Knight] keeps coming up on my back, so I'm pointing my gun at him. I'm pointing it at the car. I'm yelling, 'You guys lay down! And you, get the f**k away from me!' And every time I'd point the gun at him, he'd back off and even lift his hands up, like 'All right! All right!' So I'd go back to the car, and here he comes again. I'm like, 'F**ker, back off!' This guy is huge, and the whole time he's running around at the scene, he's gushing blood from his head. Gushing blood! I mean the guy had clearly been hit in the head, but he had all his faculties. I couldn't believe he was running around and doing what he was doing, yelling back and forth." Rolling Stone: Saul Williams to star in Tupac-inspired musical Carroll says when he finally was able to open the door, Shakur's limp body fell out of the vehicle, "like he was leaning against the door." "So I grabbed him with my left arm, and he falls into me, and I've still got my gun in the other hand," he continues. "He's covered with blood, and I immediately notice that the guy's got a ton of gold on -- a necklace and other jewelry -- and all of the gold is covered in blood. That has always left an image in my mind. . . After I pulled him out, Suge starts yelling at him, 'Pac! Pac!' And he just keeps yelling it. And the guy I'm holding is trying to yell back at him. He's sitting up and he's struggling to get the words out, but he can't really do it. And as Suge is yelling 'Pac!,' I look down and I realize that this is Tupac Shakur." Carroll says he attempted to get a "dying declaration" of a potential suspect from Shakur, but the rapper was ignoring him at first. "And then I saw in his face, in his movements, all of a sudden in the snap of a finger, he changed," he says. "And he went from struggling to speak, being noncooperative, to an 'I'm at peace' type of thing. Just like that. . . He went from fighting to 'I can't do it.' And when he made that transition, he looked at me, and he's looking right in my eyes. And that's when I looked at him and said one more time, 'Who shot you?'. . . He looked at me and he took a breath to get the words out, and he opened his mouth, and I thought I was actually going to get some cooperation. And then the words came out: 'F**k you.' After that, he started gurgling and slipping out of consciousness." Rolling Stone: Kendrick Lamar covers Tupac at iHeartRadio Awards So why is Carroll coming forward with with information in 2014? Two reasons: Retiring from the Metro has allowed him the freedom to speak about the homicide case without being reprimanded ("It's been almost 18 years," he says. There's clearly never going to be a court case on this."), and he also didn't want "Tupac to be a martyr or a hero because he told the cops 'F**k you.'" Carroll says Shakur never spoke another word -- remaining silent even when another officer tried to draw out a declaration in the ambulance. "As soon as he got to the hospital, he went into surgery and was heavily sedated, and I guess he went into a coma and really never came out of that, until they took him off of life support," he continues. "So that moment I talked to him was his last real living moment where he was speaking. I talked to the cop who rode in the ambulance with him. He said Tupac never came out of it, and he never said anything at the hospital. There was nothing else." See the original story at RollingStone.com.   Copyright  2011 Rolling Stone.

The former Beatle is on the road to recovery after falling ill during his "Out There" tour in Asia, where he was forced to postpone shows in Japan. "Since contracting a virus last week that led to the postponement of tour dates, Paul received successful medical treatment at a hospital in Tokyo," according to a statement posted Thursday on his official website. "He'll make a complete recovery and has been ordered to take a few days rest." Cancellations are rare for McCartney, who has proven an iron man while maintaining a global tour schedule over the past several years. He'll turn 72 in June. McCartney plans to reschedule the shows at Tokyo's National Stadium, which were originally planned for May 18 and 19. Shows scheduled for May 21, at Tokyo's Nippon Budokan, and May 24, at Osaka's Yanmar Stadium Nagai, have also been postponed. The musician was touched by the messages of support, according to his site. "Paul has been extremely moved by all the messages and well wishes he has received from fans all over the world," the statement said.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/19/showbiz/tv/robin-thicke-paula-patton-billboard-awards/index.html	entertainment	Robin Thicke is still trying to get Paula Patton back - CNN.com	2014/05/19	Monday May 19 05:11:48 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Robin Thicke isn't giving up on his marriage to Paula Patton. The couple, married since 2005, mutually decided to separate in February, and since then singer Thicke has been trying to win her back with his performances. It was speculated that Thicke might try such a gesture during his set at the Billboard Music Awards on Sunday. Sure enough, the R&B crooner appeared to make a not-so-veiled reference to his romantic life with a performance of "Get Her Back" during the ceremony. The new single has lyrics such as "all I want to do is make it right" and, "I miss you, I miss you so much, baby/I just want you to come back home." While Thicke never mentioned Patton by name during the performance, he did thank his "wife" for "her love and support and for putting up with me all these years" during an acceptance speech for Top R&B song. That also wouldn't be the first time Thicke's tried such a maneuver. Not long after the couple announced their separation,Thicke took the stage in Virginia and dedicated his hit "Lost Without You" to his wife. "I'm trying to get my girl back," he told the crowd. "She's a good woman." According to People magazine, Thicke's taking his tour of love to Tuesday night's "The Voice" finale as well. Patton, for her part, has been somewhat more demure about the couple's status. When Vanity Fair wanted to know if her relationship with Thicke had reached its end, the actress vaguely replied, "We've known each other since we were teenagers. All I can tell you is there's a deep love there -- always was, and always will be."

"Uncomfortable, odd and eerily interesting," is how public relations agent Simone Smalls summed it up in a tweet. "Not quite sure what to feel. #MissingMJ" Uncomfortable because Jackson died nearly five years ago while preparing for a comeback tour. His remains are resting in a crypt in a Forest Lawn mausoleum. But technology tricked viewers -- and the celebrity audience in the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas -- into suspending disbelief for a few minutes to watch the pop icon onstage dancing and singing his "new" song "Slave to the Rhythm." Ludacris, the rapper-actor who hosted the show, actually introduced it as "Live from the MGM Grand, Michael Jackson." "He's baaaccck!" Mark Cuban, the owner of an NBA team and TV channel, tweeted about Jackson's "hologram." Cuban added an Instagram video. He's baaaccck! http://t.co/1oUqHyMxrr The dance moves were not really Michael Jackson's but apparently those of a stand-in performer who recreated his steps for a computer that then laid on an image intended to replicate Jackson. But where was the swagger -- like Charlie Chaplin -- that characterized Jackson's cool walk? @AlanDukeCNN @MJFam4ever Look at (t)his face...disappointing. pic.twitter.com/yWHqHsTe1I "I wish it would have actually looked like him," one fan said. It was eerily interesting because the illusion was effective if you didn't watch too closely or weren't obsessively familiar with Jackson's dancing, walking and appearance. "I enjoyed it. Could have had better face but overall it was great. Will have it on repeat," a diehard Jackson fan tweeted.  #kendallyouhadonejob Imagine Ed Sullivan confusing the Beatles with the Beach Boys when he introduced the British group's first live U.S. television performance 50 years ago. That's the modern equivalent of what Kendall Jenner did at the Billboard Awards. Anndddd as if I wasn't nervous already!!!! #NeverLeavinMyContactsAtHomeAgain! #LOL #LessonLearned The reality TV personality, model and Kardashian half-sister caught herself halfway through introducing the Australian boy band 5 Seconds of Summer as One Direction. "Now, we welcome One... Guys, I'm the worst reader!" Jenner said as she dived below the camera shot. She quickly tossed to a video of the group -- which included a short clip comparing their arrival in the United States to the Beatles' 1964 invasion. Jenner never fully recovered. The television audience only heard her say "of Summer" when she resumed the intro after the video. Twitter had a blast with the 18-year-old's flub. Two hashtags soon trended: #kendallyouhadonejob and #KendalljennerItsFIVE I got my party pants on #Billboards http://t.co/C1dnDHaDXL But many -- including Jenner herself -- agreed on one thing. Kendall Jenner looked great on the red carpet. Lorde's message Lorde wants you to know she's no longer the young 15-year-old who recorded "Royals," a song that spent much of last summer at the top of the charts and was honored Sunday as the "top rock song." "What I wanted to say was that I am 17 and a half now," Lorde said as she accepted Billboard's top new artist award. When laughter erupted with that remark, she stopped to say "that wasn't a joke." Lorde's said she's had "the opportunity to grow and learn as a new artist" in the last year "in the spotlight." but srsly you guys i meant what i said in my speech! THANKYOU for giving me a chance to grow and get better - it's all you. She later performed "Tennis Court," another song from her younger years. The irony not lost on the Billboard audience is that many people are surprised to learn that the mature talking-acting-looking New Zealander is actually a teenager. #Lordeis17 became a trending topic on Twitter worldwide.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/18/showbiz/celebrity-news-gossip/beyonce-jay-z-movie-trailer/index.html	entertainment	Beyonce and Jay Z release star-studded trailer to promote tour - CNN.com	2014/05/18	Sunday May 18 11:34:45 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Jay Z and Beyonce continue to be full of surprises. In the midst of all of the hoopla surrounding the now well-known elevator incident involving the couple and Beyonce's younger sister, Solange Knowles, the superstar pair have released a "trailer" for their upcoming tour. The star-studded short features cameos from actors Jake Gyllenhaal (who is now part of meme history thanks to a recent courtside photo with the superstar couple), Sean Penn, Don Cheadle, "Scandal" actor Guillermo Daz, Blake Lively, Emmy Rossum, and sisters Rashida and Kidada Jones. Directed by Melina Matsoukas, who has worked with Beyonce on music videos, the minimovie is meant to promote the 16-city "On The Run" tour, which will mark the first time the singer and her rapper husband have toured jointly. In the trailer, the couple portray a pair of outlaw lovers seen making deals, executing a heist, running from the authorities and sharing tender moments in a hotel room. One scene shows them emerging from an elevator wearing masks -- which could be seen as a bit of irony, given the recent headlines following the release of a surveillance video showing Solange Knowles punching and kicking Jay Z in a hotel elevator while Beyonce stood nearby on the night of the Met Gala in New York City. The trio have since released a statement which says in part, "We love each other and above all we are family. We've put this behind us and hope everyone else will do the same." Music featuring the rap mogul and his wife play in the almost four-minute video, which hit the Web on Saturday. Titled "Run," it's listed as a joint production between Jay Z's Roc Nation and Beyonce's Parkwood Entertainment. The "On The Run" stadium tour kicks off June 25 in Miami.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/01/showbiz/michael-jackson-new-song/index.html	entertainment	Michael Jackson song from 1983 released; first single from 'new' album - CNN.com	2014/05/01	Thursday May 1 09:20:17 EDT 2014	Los Angeles (CNN) -- A song Michael Jackson recorded 31 years ago is out, the first single from the upcoming "Xscape" album. Jackson wrote, recorded and produced "Love Never Felt So Good" with Paul Anka in 1983, but it has been "contemporized" by Anka and Jackson estate co-executor John McClain, according to an Epic Records news release. The song has "a magic combination of the new and the original production that retains the track's analog, early 80s feel, while also sounding right at home with the disco-soul inflected music of today," the label said. The track debuted during the iHeartRadio Music Awards on Thursday night. Online music services, including iTunes, have it for downloading starting early Friday morning, Epic said. Jackson and Anka worked on the song at about the same time they wrote and recorded "This Is It," which eventually became the theme song to a documentary based on Jackson's preparations for a tour that never happened because of his death. Jackson died at age 50 on June 25, 2009, while preparing for his "This Is It" comeback tour. Eight previously unheard Michael Jackson songs, originally recorded between 1983 and 1999, will be released on the new album May 13, Epic Records announced in March. Epic Chairman L.A. Reid chose several producers with the "gravitas, depth and range to creatively engage with Jackson's work" to update the recordings for release, Epic said. New Michael Jackson album coming in May: 'Xscape'  Timbaland is the lead producer, with contributions from Rodney Jerkins, Stargate, Jerome "J-Roc" Harmon and McClain, the release said. A bonus version of "Love Never Felt So Good" features Justin Timberlake along with Jackson. Sony's Columbia Epic Records -- Jackson's record label for three decades -- signed a longterm deal with Jackson's estate to posthumously release music from the large archives of his recordings. Reid "was granted unlimited access to the treasures representing four decades of material on which Jackson had completed his vocals," the announcement said. "New" music is not always met with a warm reception from fans and the Jackson family. Some questioned the authenticity of the vocals on a 2010 album, although the estate and the record company said sound experts verified Jackson's voice.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/24/showbiz/game-of-thrones-america/index.html	entertainment	How 'Game of Thrones' is like America - CNN.com	2014/05/24	Saturday May 24 08:03:55 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- A fire-breathing dragon has never vaporized a senator giving a pompous speech on C-SPAN. No candidate has ever poisoned a rival at his wedding reception, and no "white walker" zombie has ever dragged a screaming climate change skeptic away. Yet anyone who thinks HBO's popular "Game of Thrones" is just about kings and castles misses how much the show reflects contemporary America, several scholars, authors and fans of the show say. The fantasy TV series is set in the fictional kingdom of Westeros, where a small group of powerful families scheme against one another to seize control of the "iron throne." Look past the dragons and knights, though, and the show offers eerie political and racial parallels between the world of Westeros and the United States, fans and scholars say. Here are five of them: Only elites can play the game There is no middle class in "Game of Thrones." The "99%" of Westeros -- the peasants, innkeepers and farmers -- survive at the whim of a small group of wealthy families who treat them with indifference and cruelty. The HBO show is an adaptation of George R.R. Martin's series, "A Song of Ice and Fire." (HBO and CNN are both owned by Time Warner.) Martin modeled his books on medieval Europe, where there was a huge gap between the rich and poor, says Steven Attewell, author of "Race for the Iron Throne" and editor of a blog with the same title. Medieval thinkers justified that gap by using some of the same rhetoric people use today to explain poverty: It's the poor's fault. The poor were told that there was something inherently wrong with them: They were the descendants of Noah's son, Ham, a cursed Biblical figure, Attewell says. "They said that because the poor people are sons and daughters of Ham, it was God's will that they serve as peasants," Attewell says. "They also cited passages in the Bible that commanded obedience to the king and the servant to the master." Social mobility was extremely limited by modern standards, Attewell says. A typical peasant paid taxes to a lord who essentially owned him. "It was hard to get past the idea of a monarchy," Attewell says. "They didn't have examples of democracy. Even when you had a social revolution from below in this period, they didn't have an alternate model of government to look to." Neither does "Game of Thrones," because the rich control everything. They own the land and the political process, and the only contenders for the iron throne come from a small group of powerful dynastic families. The show's depiction of families fighting for control mirrors where U.S. politics could be headed, says Joshua Weikert, a political science professor from Albright College in Pennsylvania. The 2016 presidential election could well feature another Clinton vs. Bush contest if Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush decide to run. Could Americans one day say, without irony, "The House of Bush" or "The House of Clinton"? In the show, "two or three primary families trade off and form alliances to enhance their position," Weikert says. "Can we really see none of the Kennedys, Bushes and Clintons in these machinations?" When the rich control the political process, it's difficult for a country to remain a democracy, according to one of the most popular books in the United States.  "Capital in the Twenty-First Century" is not just a best-seller, it has become a cultural phenomenon. Thomas Piketty, a French economist, warns in his book that concentrating wealth at the top invariably corrodes democracy. He argues after studying two centuries of economic data that economic inequality is wired into the machinery of capitalism. And he says the United States is headed toward an aristocratic future resembling 19th century Europe, where powerful families sustained by inherited wealth rule the rest. There are no royal families in the United States, but Weikert says many Americans share the same sentiment as the jaded "99%" of Westeros: "The game is played among elites."  It's a man's world The late soul singer James Brown never makes an appearance in "Game of Thrones," but his song, "It's a Man's Man's Man's World," could be its unofficial soundtrack. There are no men pushing for gender equality in "Game of Thrones." Male characters unapologetically beat women, rape them and throw them away as if they're old sofas. Yet to paraphrase Brown, the show "wouldn't be nothing" without a cast of formidable female characters who refuse to play the roles assigned to them. The women of Westeros don't wait for knights to rescue them from dragons; one of them commands three dragons of her own. She is Daenerys Targaryen, the young sole survivor of a royal family. She starts as a timid pawn of men who violate her and treat her with contempt. She becomes a legendary warrior queen. The show's fan base is filled with women who identify with characters like Daenerys Targaryen. They revel in her ability to rise to the top in a male-dominated world, says Paul Levinson, a communications professor at Fordham University in New York. "They're seeing women in positions of power more and more," Levinson says. "Not only Hillary but people like (Sen.) Elizabeth Warren and Sarah Palin. Daenerys captures that aspect. She constantly gets the better of men." One of the most beloved characters in the show is Arya Stark, an adolescent girl who outthinks and out-toughs men. Born to a noble family, she rejects the notion that she must marry a lord and bear his children to be a successful woman. She forges herself into a skilled warrior to avenge her family's honor. "We gravitate to Arya because she provides a refreshing alternative to the damsels in distress we typically see in medieval dramas," says Jamie Adair, editor of the "History Behind the Game of Thrones" blog. "Arya's assertiveness speaks to our modern values. She's driven by revenge and she's willing to be ruthless." The show's portrayal of women is a reflection of a deeper message in Martin's "Game of Thrones" books: Kings may rule, but their rise and fall ultimately depends on the small folks, says Charli Carpenter, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. "What Martin has done is create a story about elite politics told through the viewpoint of the marginalized: women, prostitutes, bastards, dwarfs," says Carpenter, author of an essay in Foreign Affairs magazine entitled, "Game of Thrones as Theory."  Political paralysis jeopardizes the future In one of the most famous scenes in "Game of Thrones," another powerful woman, Cersei Lannister, the Queen of Westeros, schools a rival on political power. "When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die," she tells him. "There is no middle ground." Cersei Lannister isn't much for bipartisan cooperation. She would fit right into the current U.S. Congress, which is on its way to becoming the least productive and most ideologically divided one in history, according to some reports. (It's also the richest, as well as the first Congress where the majority of its members are millionaires, another report says). The price of political paralysis is one of biggest themes in "Game of Thrones" and a persistent theme in U.S. politics, scholars and fans say. In Westeros, leaders spend more time fighting one another than helping their subjects. Most are only driven by self-interest. They constantly question the right of other kings to rule. The kingdom even has its own version of a "birther" controversy: A king is accused of being illegitimate because his family hid his true lineage. The political paralysis in Westeros comes at a dangerous time. Feuding leaders ignore the real existential threat to their world. An army of ice-encrusted zombies called "white walkers" is mobilizing to destroy the kingdom and usher in an ice age. "Winter is coming," is the ominous conclusion one leader delivers after watching the deadly white walkers in action, but no one listens to him. You couldn't find a more apt comparison to feuding political leaders in the United States who are ignoring global warming, says Gordon Coonfield, a communications professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. "Multiple factions are so busy with infighting," he says, "that they are completely unaware or indifferent to a looming apocalypse." The rulers in "Game of Thrones" also ignore another looming political issue, fans and scholars say: Westeros, too, has an immigration problem no one wants to tackle. Instead, the rulers have relied on a giant wall originally built to keep out white walkers but now used to stop border crossings of an impoverished group the people of Westeros dismiss as "wildlings." The rhetoric used to justify the wall is similar to some of the language used in America's immigration debate, says Weikert, the political science professor at Albright College. "They say we need to make sure that 'they' don't come in here and ruin our society and culture," Weikert says. "Some people were lucky enough to be born on the 'right' side of the border and have an interest in keeping out those who are threatening the existing order." A nation lives beyond its means There are plenty of supernatural creatures and vicious villains in "Game of Thrones," but there is one entity that no one dares cross: The Iron Bank of Braavos. If you think the Wall Street money managers who almost ruined the global economy are heartless capitalists, you should meet the dreaded bureaucrats from the Iron Bank. It's the most powerful bank in the world of "Game of Thrones." It doesn't really care about the health of Westeros' economy or the poor people living on a "bowl of brown" in the kingdom's "Flea Bottom" ghetto. They just want their money, and they're willing to unleash chaos to get it. "The great thing about the bank," says Weikert, "is if you don't pay what you owe, they give loans to your enemy to overthrow you." Think of the Iron Bank as America's deficit, fans of the show say: It's an economic guillotine that hangs over the future, they say. Several kings of Westeros have amassed huge national debts because of Iron Bank loans, but they're afraid to tell their subjects that their country is living beyond its means. National debt, in the United States as in Westeros, scares political leaders. In "Game of Thrones," all leaders dread the Iron Bank's motto: "The Iron Bank will have its due." Race still matters There are no racial scandals in Westeros. No one secretly recorded a ruler dehumanizing another ethnic group. But that doesn't mean racial stereotypes in contemporary America haven't wormed their way into the show's scripts, some bloggers and authors say. Much of that criticism centers on the storyline involving Daenerys Targaryen, the exiled warrior queen. The pale, silver-haired leader liberates an army of black and brown slaves as she marches through a North African-like region, breaking the chains of oppressed peoples. It's thrilling stuff -- "Occupy Wall Street" with three fire-breathing dragons. Still, some critics say the plotline unwittingly resurrects a racial stereotype often used to justify U.S. imperialism: white saviors rescuing dark-skinned people from the barbarity of their ways. Whiteness is "both a conquering and civilizing force" in "Game of Thrones," stand-up comedian Aamer Rahman wrote in his blog. British blogger Shane Thomas called Targaryen's conquests the "save the coloureds" tour. Saladin Ahmed, author of "Throne of the Crescent Moon," says the show also reinforces some stereotypes about black and brown men in its depiction of the Dothraki people, a nomadic, brown-skinned tribe portrayed as hypersexual and hyperviolent. Even more fully drawn characters of color like Missandei, a regal woman who acts as Daenerys' translator and aide, slip into stereotypical behavior, Ahmed says. The actress who plays Missandei, Nathalie Emmanuel, is fantastic, but her character becomes a clich at times, Ahmed says. "She is the black best friend every white girl has," he says. "She has no story of her own. She has no desires or wants of her own. She's just there to give advice to Daenerys." With the introduction of new characters like Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne, also known as the "Red Viper," there are hints the show may begin treating its characters of color with more complexity. But that day hasn't quite come yet, Ahmed says. The show, Ahmed says, "has the same problem Hollywood in general has: limiting actors of color to villains, best friends and martyrs for white people." "Game of Thrones" may yet evolve. Part of its appeal is its unpredictability. No one really knows where the story is headed because Martin is still adding books to his series and he's not afraid to kill beloved characters. Martin may yet give fans a happy ending. But as some Americans look ahead to their own country's future, they may also conclude: "Winter is coming."  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/22/showbiz/shield-actor-michael-jace-homicide-charge/index.html	entertainment	'The Shield' actor Michael Jace officially charged with wife's murder - CNN.com	2014/05/22	Thursday May 22 01:19:59 EDT 2014	Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actor Michael Jace has been formally charged with one count of murder with a gun in the shooting death of his wife, the prosecutor's spokeswoman said Thursday. April Jace, 40, died from "multiple gunshot wounds," according to preliminary autopsy results. The death was ruled a homicide by the Los Angeles County coroner, Deputy Chief Coroner Ed Winter said. Jace, 51, made his first appearance in a Los Angeles courtroom Thursday afternoon. Bail was set at $2 million, and his arraignment was continued until June 18 at the defense's request. "He's doing as well as somebody who is in custody," said Jason Sias, Jace's lawyer. "It's emotional. He wants to see this through. He's just thinking about his children." Los Angeles police detectives presented their evidence against Jace, who played a Los Angeles cop in TV's "The Shield," to the district attorney Thursday morning, according to spokeswoman Jane Robison. Police found April Jace shot to death in her south Los Angeles home Monday night, Det. Lyman Doster said. Michael Jace called 911 to report that his wife had been shot, Det. Dean Vinluan said, adding that he "was on the phone with the operator." Neighbors who heard gunshots also called 911, he said. "At this moment, the motive of the murder is believed to be domestic violence," a police statement this week said. Investigators detained Jace at the couple's Hyde Park-area home Monday night and booked the actor on a homicide charge early Tuesday, according to Doster. Two children were in the home when their mother was shot, Vinluan said. The children, whose ages he would not reveal, were taken to a police station and then handed over to a representative of California's Department of Children and Family Services, he said. Investigators have found no reports of domestic violence between the husband and wife at their south Los Angeles residence, another LAPD detective said. A woman described as a close friend of Jace's first wife said in a sworn statement that she witnessed Jace physically abusing his wife in 1997. The declaration was in court records from Jace's 2005 custody case concerning his son with Jennifer Bitterman. Jace "choked and hit" his wife and "slammed her against the wall while (their infant son) screamed in his crib next to her," Maria De Le Vegas said in the sworn declaration obtained by CNN. Jace "was raging and out of control, and seeing the extent of his anger was one of the most terrifying things I have ever seen," she said. Jace appeared to be suffering severe financial strain in recent years, according to court documents obtained by CNN. The actor filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in March 2011, citing $500,000 in debts and an annual income of around $80,000 from residuals from his TV and film work, the documents said. Jace had defaulted on the $411,000 mortgage on the south Los Angeles home where his wife died, according to the documents. He married April Jace in June 2003, a year after divorcing his first wife, with whom he shared a son who is now a teen. The FX police drama "The Shield" was the biggest and longest-running role in Jace's 22-year acting career. He appeared in 89 episodes as Julien Lowe, who started as a rookie officer in an inner-city Los Angeles police precinct in 2002 and rose through the ranks to become a detective before the series ended in 2008, according to the Internet Movie Database. He acted on several episodes of "Southland," another TV drama about Los Angeles police, between 2009 and 2012. Jace often played a law enforcement or military officer on television shows. He is credited with roles in "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation," "Private Practice," "The Mentalist," "Burn Notice" and "NYPD Blue." He had the title role of Michael Jordan in the 1999 TV movie about the NBA star, "Michael Jordan: An American Hero." Jace played Officer Brown in Russell Crowe's 2009 film "State of Play," and he portrayed a Black Panther member in the 1994 blockbuster movie "Forrest Gump." April Jace had worked for the past year as a financial aid counselor at Biola University, a private school in La Mirada, California, according to the school. "We are obviously shocked and saddened by this terrible news, to lose a wonderful colleague, mother and friend," Biola President Barry Corey said in a written statement. "April's radiant personality brought great energy to the financial aid office," financial aid director Geoff Marsh said. "Her love for helping students and families and her great work ethic earned the respect and love of her coworkers. Her smiling face and helpful spirit will be missed by all."

On Monday night, the "Wheel of Fortune" host -- a conservative who's occasionally used his Twitter account to tweak liberals -- tweeted, "I now believe global warming alarmists are unpatriotic racists knowingly misleading for their own ends. Good night." The reaction from the Twitterverse was swift and blunt. Some tried reason. Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State, tweeted that climate change could have huge repercussions. "Hey @PatSajak, this aint the Wheel of Fortune. If we lose this game, it isn't just one person's misfortune. All humanity pays the price," he posted. Hey @PatSajak, this aint the Wheel of Fortune.

On one hand 97% of scientists on the other hand a guy that got his job because chuck woolery came across as too intellectual "Say what you will about Pat Sajak but that guy works 35 days a year," tweeted Pat Thornton. Say what you will about Pat Sajak but that guy works 35 days a year Sajak continued poking. "Taking next few weeks off. Computer models have already determined winners," Sajak posted Tuesday morning. He soon acknowledged he was just trying to get a rise out of people. "Sometimes it's fun to poke a stick in a hornets' nest just to hear the buzzing," he tweeted Tuesday afternoon. In a statement, Sajak said he was just being snarky. "Of course I was joking. Just mocking the name-calling that is directed at global warming skeptics within and without the scientific community," he said in a statement from his representative. As Vice magazine noted, Sajak has a habit of mocking climate change. He's tweeted about Al Gore, fund-raising and his nephew being a "Tooth Fairy denier." On Wednesday, Sajak puckishly observed that he'd hit a hot button. "Later today I'll be tweeting my views on the subjects of nuclear proliferation and free-range chicken," he tweeted.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/21/showbiz/tv/the-voice-who-won-the-voice/index.html	entertainment	'The Voice' winner sets a new trend - CNN.com	2014/05/21	Wednesday May 21 10:17:41 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- "The Voice's" new winner has put Usher on the scoreboard. On Tuesday night's "The Voice" finale, the R&B singer's mentee, Josh Kaufman, was crowned the winner of Season 6. Kaufman's victory came in spite of a technical glitch that made it difficult for fans to show their support of him on iTunes, where his performance from Monday night's show was available for download. "The Voice" lets its viewers vote for their favorite singer through phone, e-mail, text and by downloading songs from the show on iTunes. However, as Kaufman warned his fans on Twitter, his cover of Adele's "Set Fire to the Rain" from Monday's show wasn't showing up where viewers expected. As a result, "The Voice" host Carson Daly said at the start of Tuesday's finale that all of the iTunes downloads from Monday night's show were being tossed out, but the glitch didn't impact the final results. Kaufman was up against Christina Grimmie, the Team Adam Levine singer who came in third, and Jake Worthington from Team Blake Shelton, who placed second. For the first time, neither Adam Levine nor Blake Shelton could boast coaching the season's winner, as Kaufman sealed the championship for Team Usher. (Although, to be fair, Kaufman was on Levine's team first.) Kaufman was at the top of his game during the finale, as he performed a duet with Robin Thicke. The pair of soulful crooners did a rendition of Thicke's new song, "Get Her Back." And with this being "The Voice," that was (obviously) far from the only performance.

The real question is whether the best home for those talents is on her own variety show. The "Saturday Night Live" alum tested that theory on Monday night with the hour-long NBC special "The Maya Rudolph Show." Critics weren't bowled over, but the ratings were nothing to sneeze at with 7.2 million tuning in. (It probably didn't hurt that "The Maya ... Show" premiered after "The Voice," which had 11.5 million watching the first part of its season finale.) The concept for "The Maya Rudolph Show" is a callback to the variety specials of yore, with '70s programs like "The Carol Burnett Show" and "Donny & Marie" serving as inspiration. Monday's hour included song, dance, sketches and plenty of "SNL" cameos, but unlike Rudolph's former gig, the variety show wasn't live, late night TV. "I always really responded to the familial aspect of it and how much fun they were having, which is what I miss more than anything about 'SNL' -- my friends and laughing," Rudolph previously told Entertainment Weekly. According to critics, Rudolph's special wasn't too short on laughs -- but it did lack cohesiveness and timeliness. "To be honest, it was a bit of a mess -- albeit a wildly entertaining one," said The Daily Beast's Kevin Fallon. "It was a sometimes too-corny, sometimes too-raunchy, scattershot hour that was as gut-bustingly hilarious as it was completely baffling." So while "it's certainly admirable that NBC is attempting to bring the variety show back -- and they've made a genius decision in entrusting Rudolph to lead the way -- the question is whether anyone will follow, or even if they'd want to." With audiences accustomed to watching entire networks devoted to precisely what they're in the mood for -- music, comedy or otherwise -- the variety show necessitates the sort of patience the average TV viewer may not have, argues NPR's David Bianculli. And with critics divided on whether Rudolph was magnetic enough to hold viewers' attention for an hour, it's unclear if she can single-handedly revive the retro format. (Bianculli, for one, thinks Justin Timberlake or Neil Patrick Harris would be able to do it better.) Slate's TV critic Willa Paskin agreed that "The Maya Rudolph Show" was "pleasant without being particularly funny or memorable, odd without being urgent or edgy, scattershot without taking any big swings." "On the strength of last night's pleasant, listless example, maybe (the variety show) needs reviving even less than pop-up video." New York magazine's Margaret Lyons, too, wasn't quite sold that "variety is a format that makes sense on American TV in 2014," but she did think the first airing of "The Maya Rudolph Show" had its strengths. "I hope this isn't the series' only outing because I have almost infinite positive regard for Rudolph, and I'd rather see a show like this find itself than watch another second of some hate-soaked but competent sitcom," Lyons reviewed. "But I kept wondering what the mission of 'TMRS' is, what tone it aspires to, how it sees itself, how it's supposed to feel. ... Mostly, though, the show just needs to be more."

In anticipation of its newest 10-episode series, "Halt and Catch Fire," AMC is launching a two-week, full-episode sneak preview on Tumblr and AMC.com, making it the first-ever television show to premiere on Tumblr. "Halt and Catch Fire," created by Christopher Cantwell and Christopher C. Rogers, follows the rise of the PC in the early 1980s, roughly one year after IBM. "Halt and Catch Fire is a fun ride through the early days of the PC era, a time when no one could imagine a portable computer weighing less than 15 pounds, let alone one that was a few ounces and doubled as a phone," AMC President Charlie Collier said in a statement. "It's a perfect show for summer and -- given the subject matter -- a good fit for Tumblr's first TV series premiere and AMC's first social media screening." In addition to the launch of the new series, AMC also plans to launch a branded network Tumblr page to be integrated into AMC.com. "Tumblr is the biggest platform for social TV and destination for many of AMC's most passionate fans," Global Head of Brand Partnerships at Tumblr Lee Brown said. "We're excited to welcome Halt and Catch Fire and the rest of AMC's lineup to the home of fandoms through Tumblr integration on AMC.com and to offer this first look at Halt and Catch Fire to our community."

Sandler and Drew Barrymore unite for a third time, after "50 First Dates," but like an unhappy old married couple staring at the clock, they ran out of fresh and meaningful things to say years ago. Sandler plays a Dick's Sporting Goods employee named Jim who lost his wife to cancer and hasn't a clue how to raise his three daughters. The eldest, for example, is named Hilary (Bella Thorne) but Jim calls her Larry  presumably because she's good at basketball and has Larry Bird's 1979 hairstyle. 'The Giver' character posters: The eyes have it Barrymore plays Lauren, a working single mom with two holy terror sons, one of whom is pulsating with puberty and a pornography obsession. Jim and Lauren get set up on a disastrous blind date, and both part ways hoping to never see the other again. But before you can say, "Hey guys, it's Adam. I convinced a studio to finance our group vacation to South Africa as long as we make a movie with oodles of product placement," both families are thrust together at a luxurious resort that specializes in blended and nontraditional-family vacations. How and why? Does it really matter? Once in South Africa, mutual loathing turns to mutual respect, with Lauren giving Hilary a makeover and Jim helping Lauren's boys with sports. When Lauren discovers Jim's sensitive soul, and Jim sees Lauren in a sexy black dress ... well, I don't want to ruin the ending for you! 'Godzilla': The secrets behind the roar "Blended" is dotted with familiar faces from previous Sandler comedies and a few hammy celebrity cameos, but only Kevin Nealon -- who plays a middle-aged dad enamored with his buxom new bimbo -- delivers any solid laughs. (Poor Joel McHale didn't even get to visit Africa for the lackluster assignment of playing Lauren's douche-y ex, whose one-line character description must've been, "Craig Kilborn in 'Old School.'") Though he's starring in promising upcoming films from directors Tom McCarthy and Jason Reitman, Sandler still seems shackled with the golden handcuffs of making easy, lucrative comedies, from "Click" to "Bedtime Stories" to "Grown Ups." In "Blended," his comic flab has never felt as thick, and this hackneyed "family-friendly" entertainment feels less like a movie than a bad sitcom re-run. Grade: D+ See the original story at EW.com.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/21/showbiz/movies/batman-superman-dawn-of-justice/index.html	entertainment	'Batman v Superman's' official title: Who likes it? - CNN.com	2014/05/21	Wednesday May 21 06:26:20 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- The only thing that dawned when the official "Batman vs. Superman" title was announced on Wednesday was how much the Internet hated it. For months, fans have referred to the upcoming "Man of Steel" sequel as just "Batman vs. Superman," a placeholder that also recognizes the fact that both superheroes are appearing on the big screen together for the first time. But on Wednesday, the actual title was unveiled to be "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," along with the announcement that production on the project is now underway in metro Detroit. Immediately, the Twitterati fired back. "BATMAN v SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE. Coming in September, to Lifetime Networks," chided Patton Oswalt. "OK, I just clicked on 'Dawn of Justice' in a panic, thinking it was yet another Far Right Group," said @Scriblit. "Dawn Of Justice sounds like Steven Seagal's comeback movie," quipped @DoctorFluxx. "Dawn of Justice? So THAT'S why Batman looks so sad," said @ElliottcMorgan, referencing the recently released first look at Ben Affleck's Batman. (Who, yes, does look pretty down.) Another user thought "it makes it sound like a direct-to-DVD movie you'd find in a bargain bin," as The Hollywood Reporter's Borys Kit tried to remind the displeased masses, "it's always darkest before dawn (of justice)." "Does anyone out there like the title?" Kit asked. "Anyone?" Well at least one person does -- if he could only figure out why the studio insisted on taking the "s" out of "vs." "The 'Dawn of Justice' thing is cool but having it be Batman 'V' Superman is annoying my OCD," tweeted Chris Stuckmann. "When I see the new title, I read it as 'Batman 5 Superman'. Help me!" Others are more concerned that the movie's going to have some sort of secret, litigious spin. "Oh my god. What if 'Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice' is A LAW MOVIE? And 'Batman v. Superman' is the lawsuit?" asked @Hello_Tailor. If it is, the Warner Bros. press release Wednesday didn't give any indication of that. Along with the new title and new logo, the statement confirmed that Chris Terrio ("Argo") is writing the script, which we already knew would be directed by "Man of Steel" helmer Zack Snyder. In addition to Affleck, Henry Cavill returns as Superman, and Gal Gadot is going to play Wonder Woman. Laurence Fishburne, Amy Adams and Diane Lane are all reprising their "Man of Steel" roles, and they'll be joined by Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, Jeremy Irons as Alfred and Holly Hunter in an unspecified, newly created role. Once "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" finishes filming -- production will also take place in Illinois, Africa and the South Pacific -- the movie will arrive in theaters on May 6, 2016.

How to REALLY sell a film at Cannes - CNN.com	2014/05/22	Thursday May 22 09:40:18 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Click here if viewing on mobile  (CNN) -- Away from the manicured glamor of the Croisette, there's another Cannes -- a Cannes that lies beneath. Beneath the red carpet of the Palais du Festival in the basement, that is. It's a seething, throbbing film market alive with b-movies -- low-budget features with no big name actors attached -- often horrors, thrillers, erotic movies or "mockbusters" (more on those later). THIS IS THE CANNES YOU THINK YOU KNOW ... BUT THAT'S JUST CANNES FOR THE A-LISTERS -- THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR EVERYONE ELSE ... It's a galaxy away from the movie screenings of the Official Selection -- the elite group of films chosen by the festival's selection committee from the thousands submitted each year -- of which just 18 go into competition for the feted top prize, the Palme D'Or. THEY MOSTLY LOOK LIKE THIS ... OR LIKE THIS ...  So if you find yourself not among those with Nicole Kidman on speed dial and if your budget is a few zeros short of a few million, then head to the Marche du Film you must, to make or break your fortune. Although it's in fact one of the biggest film markets in the world, in reality it's just a sprawling global bazaar, where filmmakers and distributors come and set up stalls and negotiate. But instead of selling electronics or questionably-sourced handbags, they sell movies. Lots and lots of movies. FILMS LIKE THIS ... AND THIS ... In 2013 alone, producers, distributors, financiers, video-on-demand providers and other representatives from more than 1000 companies in 108 countries (including places as far-flung as Albania and French Guiana) came together to haggle over 5,364 films, according to official figures. So, how does an ambitious filmmaker get noticed in this mass of movies? We asked a couple of Cannes veterans and a young Welsh man who made a splash at Cannes a couple of years ago with a Zombie movie called "Colin" that he made for $70. STIR UP SOME CONTROVERSY ... Rupesh Paul Productions have announced that they are making a thriller based on the disappearance of Malaysian flight MH370. The film's promotional pamphlet says that it "tells the story of five people who seek revenge for the death of their loved ones. They hijack a plane... " Paul denies that the timing of the movie could be considered offensive of the families of the 239 men, women and children aboard the airliner that disappeared on March 8. IF YOU CAN'T MAKE A BLOCKBUSTER, MAKE A MOCKBUSTER ... Paul Bales is a partner at The Asylum, a movie production and distribution company based in Burbank, California. The Asylum is known for producing low-budget movies (around $500,000) that riff off big-budget blockbusters and are often released around the same time. On the books this year are "Sleeping Beauty," a twist on Angelina Jolie movie "Maleficent," and "Apocalypse Pompeii," another take on Paul W.S. Anderson's disaster epic "Pompeii," which cost between $80 to $100 million to make, according to Forbes. "We would love to be able to take credit for the mockbuster. The practice is called drafting ... it's been done almost since the industry started. Just like in bike racing, one racer will ride behind a faster racer and they benefit because there is less wind. "We've Just been a little more outrageous. Our (movie) titles try to get as close as possible." AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AN AWESOME POSTER ... Make them as outlandish as possible, adds Bales. At Cannes, the trade press pick them up and it's a great way of getting your name out there if you don' have a big budget or a high profile cast. GET A LITTLE HELP FROM YOUR FANS ... U.S. indie label Troma are famous for making low-budget satires with a '50s flavor with titles like "The Toxic Avenger," "The Class of Nuke 'Em High." The movie studio has been running for 40 years and, according to co-founder, Lloyd Kaufman, Troma's secret weapon is their fans. At Cannes, Troma fans help the company put on the Troma Parade and street theater they've become famous for, where characters like The Toxic Avenger act out scenes from movies. "This year, the Toxic Avenger and I have been asked to lead the zombie walk -- there's a zombie walk (at Cannes) that's been going on for about 10 years -- we've been asked to be parade masters. "That's how we get attention because we cannot afford to take the big billboards." NOTHING BEATS PERFECT TIMING ... Marc Price didn't expect much when he took "Colin," a zombie movie he made with a $70 budget, to Cannes in 2008. It was a movie he was proud of, but he also realized the timing of his no-budget horror happened to catch the zeitgeist at Cannes that year. "The global economic crisis was at its pinnacle," said Price. "So, our story fit very snugly into a success out of that." The press picked it up and the rest was history: Price says the film picked up limited theatrical release in the UK, Japan, the U.S. and Australia. See more from the Marche du Film: .  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/21/showbiz/midnight-rider-lawsuit/index.html	entertainment	Sarah Jones' family files suit in her death filming 'Midnight Rider' - CNN.com	2014/05/21	Wednesday May 21 10:00:27 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- The parents of Sarah Jones, a crew member killed while filming musician Gregg Allman's biopic "Midnight Rider," filed a wrongful death lawsuit Wednesday. Jones, a 27-year-old camera assistant, was killed by an oncoming train during production. Among the defendants are the production company, the company that operates the train tracks, and various individuals, including the film's director, executive producers, location manager and director of photography. The suit was filed in Chatham County, Georgia, which includes Savannah. "Each of the Midnight Riders Defendants had knowledge, actual or constructive, that the scene filmed on February 20 was to take place on active railroad tracks, without permission from CSX, and each Midnight Rider Defendant knew of the danger presented by filming under those circumstances," the complaint reads. "Despite this knowledge, and as set forth above, the Midnight Rider Defendants breached their duties to conduct the February 20 filming in a safe and legal manner, and each Midnight Rider Defendant is independently liable to Plaintiffs for Sarah's death and resulting damages." Jones' death rocked the film community. Crew members from various countries shared photo tributes, holding clapboards with messages of remembrance for Jones. Images were shared on a Facebook group Slates for Sarah. Jones' primary job on set was to operate the slate at the beginning of each take. Jones, an Atlanta resident and member of the International Cinematographers Guild, used her "spunk and determination" to climb up in the industry, according to an obituary. Her family is seeking an "amount to be determined by the enlightened conscience of the jury." One of the defendants, Open Road Films -- a company the complaint alleges was to serve as distributor for "Midnight Rider" -- said it was not involved in the production "in any way at any time, and we have been named in this suit without justification." "This event was a horrible tragedy, and our deepest condolences go out to the Jones family, the crew members and others who have suffered," it said. Attempts to contact other defendants' attorneys were unsuccessful Wednesday. CNN's Jane Caffrey and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report. 
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/20/showbiz/movies/channing-tatum-magic-mike-ew/index.html	entertainment	Channing Tatum reveals the 'Magic Mike XXL' plot - CNN.com	2014/05/20	Tuesday May 20 04:22:26 EDT 2014	(EW.com) -- Our wait for details on the Magic Mike sequel set to hit theaters in July 2015 is over, ladies and (gay) gentlemen. Thanks to GQ's July 2014 cover story on Channing Tatum (read it here in its entirety) we now know the plot will revolve around our favorite male exotic dancers going to a strippers' convention. According to GQ, that's the first memory of his stripper days Tatum shared with his producing partner Reid Carolin when pitching the first film: "I want to do the story of when I'm in a dark U-Haul with a bunch of these guys and we're doing drugs driving up to the stripper convention." Magic Mike director Steven Soderbergh told them the idea wasn't a scene in the movie -- it was a movie in itself. So the sequel will now be inspired by two conventions Tatum attended when he was 19. "The women would come from miles and miles around," Tatum says, recalling one audience numbering 3,000. "Then you lock the doors and you say all bets are off. It gets zany and crazy, and it's a wild ride. It's an incubator for insanity. It doesn't matter almost what you do onstage. I don't want to put anything in black and white on a page, but if you've been to one, you know how crazy it gets, and now pour kerosene on that. You've seen 'Magic Mike' -- now multiply that. Mob mentality. It's just exponentially crazier. I thought it was absolutely insane." The article also reveals that while Soderbergh's producing partner Greg Jacobs will direct the "on-the-road adventure," the retired director will still be the director of photography and camera operator, as well as the film editor. "I want to be a part of it. I want to be in the band, but I just don't want to be the frontman this time," Soderbergh says. EW: 'Magic Mike XXL' set to take it off in theaters July 2015 First thought: Imagine 3,000 extras. They should encourage women to bring their own singles and whatever money the cast earns goes to a charity of Tatum's choice. Second thought: This plot seems to remedy the three tiny complaints about the first film  that we didn't get to know the other strippers well (looking at you, Big D**k Richie and whatever Matt Bomer's character was named), that there wasn't enough dancing, and that Tatum's love interest was wooden (presumably all significant others stay at home). Below are other fun tidbits from the GQ cover story, which again, is worth reading in its entirety:  There's a reason Chan (or Chanimal, to his mother) was believable in "She's the Man:" "Soccer was the first sport that my parents put me in, and ultimately all the parents kind of came over to my mom and were, 'We think Channing would be better at football.... We love him, he's really great, but he's kind of hurting our children.' I was just a little wild."  You've seen him reenact the "Dirty Dancing" lift with his dog. Well, he can probably do the pottery wheel scene, too: In what is my favorite GQ cover story interview location since Taylor Lautner took a writer to an Olive Garden, Tatum suggested that he and his crutches-bound profiler go to the paint-your-own-pottery store Color Me Mine because he got into sculpting when he was filming "Haywire" in Santa Fe and has "always wanted to paint my own bowls and dishes and s--t." (If you're dying to know what Tatum painted, jump to the final page of the piece.)  You're going to hear a lot about his claim that he's a "high-functioning alcoholic": I've already received an email from one addiction specialist who is "available for comment." Perhaps it's a "cry for help," as that person suggests, but if you read the quote in context, you could argue it's hyperbolic. EW: Matthew McConaughey HAS to return for 'Magic Mike' sequel He likes to sculpt at night, with a bottle of wine or a glass of bourbon. "I probably drink too much, you know," he says. "My wife, that's what she bought into.... I'm probably a pretty high-functioning, I guess, you know, I would say, alcoholic, I guess." He likes how it slows down his mind. "There's probably a tendency to escape. I equate it to creativity, and I definitely equate it to having a good time." Still, he says, nothing makes you cut back like having a baby, and he'll not drink for four months when they make the Magic Mike sequel. "Then, at the end of that movie," he says, "it's go time."  On a lighter note, he and your 5-year-old niece have something in common: "I just love cake," he explains. "Confetti cake, to be specific. It has little colored candies inside the cake, and then you get the confetti icing, which is really hard to find sometimes.... It's really hard to explain to people, because it's not icing with sprinkles on top. It's icing that actually has candies inside of it. It's Funfetti icing.... The icing, coupled with the actual confetti cake. It's a beautiful mix. It is an angel sent from heaven."  You'll be left wondering what bet Tatum and Jonah Hill have made about how much "22 Jump Street" will earn its opening weekend: Hill has yet to pay up on their bet for the first film's: "I will kiss your tip! I will kiss the tip of your d through your underwear if we make $35 million." See the original story at EW.com.

The rapper -- whose real name is Xavier Smith -- pleaded "no contest" to a felony drug possession charge and a misdemeanor vandalism count during a hearing in Los Angeles on Wednesday. Los Angeles County Sheriff's investigators were looking for evidence that Bieber, 20, attacked a neighbor's home with eggs in January, when they arrested Lil Za for possession of suspected illegal drugs. Lab tests confirmed one of the drugs in the 20-year-old rapper's possession was MDMA, also known as Molly or Ecstasy, a sheriff's detective said. The vandalism charge was filed after Lil Za ripped a jail phone off the wall of a holding cell while waiting to be released. Lil Za must pay the sheriff $600 for the phone damage, along with $1,000 fine on the vandalism charge. He was sentenced to three years probation on the drug charge. He must also attend an outpatient drug treatment program and work 20 days on a highway cleanup crew. Judge Mitchell Block said as he sentenced Lil Za that he had noticed his good behavior during his several previous court appearances in the case. "That impresses me as someone who will take his probation seriously, get the job done that needs to be done," Block said. Smith was represented in court by lawyer Shawn Holley, who is also Bieber's attorney. The Los Angeles County district attorney has yet to decide if Bieber will be charged with vandalism for the egg attack. The prosecutor could decide to make it a felony case, since investigators said it caused an estimated $20,000 in damage to a Calabasas, California, mansion. It could also be prosecuted as just a misdemeanor because of the nature of the incident. Sheriff's detectives asked for a felony charge against Bieber, but his lawyers argue that the egging was a childish prank. Bieber egging 'a silly prank,' not a felony, lawyers argue

It's a touchy subject. In fact, Bieber appeared reluctant to answer any questions from an attorney for a photographer who accuses Bieber of ordering a bodyguard to attack him last summer. Several video clips of the deposition, which a Miami judge ordered in the photographer's lawsuit against Bieber, were posted Monday on the celebrity news website TMZ. The release comes just days after another Miami judge released video of Bieber giving a urine sample in jail after an arrest on a driving under the influence charge in January. In video from the deposition, Bieber primped and winked to the camera at times, but he was a hostile witness for most of the four hours of questioning by Miami lawyer Mark DiCowden, who represents photographer Jeffrey Binion. Bieber's attorney objected when DiCowden asked if he ever dated Gomez. Bieber had a long-term relationship with Gomez, which included many encounters with the paparazzi. "Sounds like you're trying to harass him," his lawyer said. DiCowden followed up by asking Bieber, 20, if he had "ever discussed his feelings about paparazzi with Gomez?" "Don't ask me about her again," Bieber answered. He wagged a finger at the lawyer, repeating at least six times, "Don't ask me about her again." At times Bieber closed his eyes, appearing to tune out the lawyer. "I don't have to listen to anything you have to say," Bieber told DiCowden. He compared the lawyer to journalist Katie Couric. "It seems like a '60 Minutes' interview," Bieber said. Evidence of Bieber's reluctance also came when he was asked if he knew "an entertainer by the name of Usher." "Yeah, Usher, that sounds familiar," Bieber answered. He later acknowledged Usher was a close friend, but he downplayed the singer's role in his career. "Isn't it true that Usher was instrumental in starting your career?" DiCowden asked. "I was found on YouTube," Bieber replied. "I think that I was detrimental to my own career." After prompting from his attorney, Bieber revised his answer to say "instrumental" -- not "detrimental." Bieber may have been too quick to respond when DiCowden asked him if he had a perscription for the sedative Xanax. "No, sir," Bieber replied. "Give me a chance to object, ok," his lawyer then whispered to Bieber. A toxicology report released by Miami Beach police said Xanax was present in Bieber's system when he was arrested on a DUI charge in January. Bieber's combativeness extended toward the court reporter who was transcribing his answers. When she remarked she could not hear Bieber's whispered answer to a question, he replied, " 'Yes' and 'no' are f--king pretty different." Lawyers for each side did not immediately respond to CNN request for comment. Bieber is likely to get more experience dealing with lawyers' questions in the coming months. He faces the DUI charge that could go to a trial in Miami as well as an assault charge in Toronto. A Los Angeles prosecutor also is close to a decision in a possible vandalism case over an alleged egg attack on the mansion of a Bieber neighbor in Calabasas, California.

The video will then be handed over to news organizations this week under Florida's open records law, a Miami judge ordered Tuesday. It's part of several hours of video captured by surveillance cameras inside the Miami Beach Police Department's jail, where Bieber was held after his arrest on DUI charges on January 23. Miami-Dade County Judge William Altfield rejected arguments from Bieber's lawyer that the video should be kept private. 
http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/25/showbiz/justin-bieber-legal-troubles/index.html	entertainment	The People v. Justin Bieber: The singer's court cases - CNN.com	2014/02/25	Tuesday Feb 25 04:57:50 EST 2014	Los Angeles (CNN) -- Justin Bieber's focusing on making new music in the hip-hop capital of Atlanta, while lawyers in three other cities prepare to defend him in court. Bieber, who graduates from being a teen pop star when he celebrates his 20th birthday Saturday, has several court dates on his calendar next month. Miami DUI case There are good reasons that Bieber's lawyers could reject a plea deal and demand a jury trial for the drunken driving charge in Miami, according to a Florida lawyer familiar with the case. Lawyers sometimes beat the charge in court. A lawyer can defend a DUI charge by focusing on the technical aspects of the arrest and testing, questioning whether police did everything right, attorney Michael Salnick told CNN. If problems or deficiencies are found in what law enforcement did, those issues could be challenged. Was there probable cause for police to stop the singer's Lamborghini? GPS tracking data suggests the sports car was not speeding in the minutes before the arrest. If the judge lets a jury hear that, it might create reasonable doubt about the police officer's claim he stopped Bieber and friend Khalil Sharieff after seeing them drag racing on a residential street. Was there probable cause for the officer to test Bieber's sobriety? The arresting officer said he became suspicious because he smelled alcohol on the singer's breath, but lab tests later showed the alcohol level in his system was well below Florida's legal limit for drivers under the drinking age of 21. Bieber's lawyer could argue that the officer made it up to justify the arrest. His defense might be bolstered if the judge allows the officer's disciplinary record to be used to challenge his credibility. While the alcohol level was below the legal limit, a preliminary toxicology report on Bieber's urine sample said he tested positive for "metabolite of THC," which indicates marijuana use, and alprazolam, the generic name for the prescription sedative Xanax. "Yeah, we were smoking all night at the studio," the singer told a police officer who told him he "reeked of marijuana," according to police documents. No-risk trial in Florida Defendants sometimes accept plea deals because they fear a judge would impose a tougher sentence if they were convicted in a trial. That's not a risk with Florida's DUI law, Salnick said. A judge would not give a sentence any different than what a prosecutor might offer in a plea deal, but a plea deal might allow the DUI charge to be kept off the defendant's criminal record, replaced by reckless driving, he said. Probation rules -- including a drug-testing requirement -- would be the same. So, why go to trial? An acquittal would be Bieber's only way to avoid probation and drug testing, short of persuading the Miami prosecutor to drop the case, Salnick said. The prosecutor in Miami has not discussed a plea agreement with Bieber's lawyer, Ed Griffith, a spokesman for the Miami-Dade state attorney's office told CNN Tuesday. "It's way too early to offer a plea deal, if one was to be offered." Bieber could choose the DUI diversion program that is available to all first-time offenders, Griffith said. It would last between six and nine months with random drug testing, about $1,000 in fines and fees, 40 hours of community service, an alcohol education class. In addition, Bieber would have to attend a session in which victims of DUI wrecks tell their stories. "There are 11 stories presented by real victims and sometimes defendants who relay their experiences," a description of the three-hour session said. "There is a quiz at the end, and the defendant has to score 100 percent prior to completion." Deal or no deal, first-time offenders rarely go to jail if convicted of drunken driving in Florida, Salnick said. Bieber is likely not facing jail, unless he violates probation -- such as by failing a drug test. A trial had been scheduled to start next Tuesday, but instead a "sounding" hearing will be held with lawyers talking to the judge about preparations for a trial. Toronto assault charge Bieber's best resolution of an assault charge in Toronto may be a plea deal that includes a "diversion" plan, according to a Canadian lawyer interviewed by CNN. "If he goes to trial, he probably would be convicted," said attorney James Morton, a past president of the Ontario Bar Association. "The Canadian system's conviction rate is extraordinarily high." Just 3.5% of all defendants who plead not guilty and go to trial are acquitted, he said. Bieber allegedly struck his limousine driver on the back of his head several times while driving to a Toronto nightclub in December. Toronto prosecutors are likely already talking to Bieber's lawyer about a plea deal with a "conditional discharge," in which the case would not be prosecuted if he takes part in anger management and community service, Morton said. It's the likely result for a young person without a criminal record who is not a celebrity, he said. Prosecutors will be under "intense scrutiny" and will want to avoid a deal that "looks like they're favoring a famous Canadian star," he said. The first court hearing is set for March 10, but Bieber does not have to be there. A magistrate will hold several hearings over the next few months to make sure the prosecution has handed over all of its evidence, including statements and any video, to the defense before the case is assigned to a judge for trial, Morton said. California egg probe Bieber faces a possible vandalism charge in connection with eggs tossed at his neighbor's home last month, which caused an estimated $20,000 damage to a Calabasas, California, mansion. The egging case is what lawyers call a "wobbler." The Los Angeles County district attorney's office could prosecute it as a misdemeanor or a felony under California law. It is up to the prosecutor to decide how serious the case is, based on a defendant's criminal history and other circumstances. A prosecutor has had the results of the sheriff's investigation for almost three weeks, and a decision could come soon. A felony vandalism conviction could bring up to three years in prison and a $50,000 fine. The maximum penalty for a misdemeanor conviction is a year in the county jail and a $50,000 fine. A felony conviction could also limit Bieber's ability to work in the United States, because he is a Canadian citizen with a work visa. Investigators searched his $6.5 million home last month, seizing the security video. Detectives gave the district attorney video clips identified from the night of the egg attack to use in the prosecution of Bieber. Another video recorded by the neighbor was also provided to investigators. Flying high? The Federal Aviation Administration is looking into allegations that Bieber and other passengers onboard a charter flight from Canada to New Jersey's Teterboro Airport on January 31 interfered with the flight crew, the agency said. Bieber and his father were "extremely abusive verbally" to the flight attendant on the Gulfstream IV aircraft as he traveled to attend the Super Bowl, according to a law enforcement sources. Both Biebers refused a pilot's repeated warnings to stop smoking pot on the flight, according to a report by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which was read to CNN. The FAA has not said when its investigation will conclude. CNN's John Couwels contributed to this report. 
http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/09/showbiz/justin-bieber-hollywood-parenting/index.html	entertainment	Hollywood's toughest role: Parent of a young celebrity - CNN.com	2014/02/09	Sunday Feb 9 11:05:28 EST 2014	Los Angeles (CNN) -- Justin Bieber's recent arrests and alleged pot-smoking antics on an airplane raise the question: Who's in charge? Can parents stand a chance of keeping their kid in line if he's a highly paid teen celebrity? CNN interviewed two celebrity parents and two professionals who help young stars after they crash about why parenthood is perhaps the toughest role in Hollywood. They point to predators, parasites and parents who don't act like parents as culprits. Parents can't be pals Justin Bieber and his dad seem to be best buddies. They even have matching tattoos. Jeremy Bieber, 38, was with his son during several of the incidents that have brought him legal trouble in the past weeks. Father and son were partying together in Miami Beach, Florida, before the younger Bieber, 19, was arrested on a drunken driving charge. The elder Bieber was with his son the night he allegedly assaulted a Toronto limousine driver. A U.S. Customs report said Jeremy and Justin Bieber were both flying on a chartered jet when the pilots had to put on oxygen masks after marijuana smoke filled the cabin. "You have the parents acting as a child with them," said Dr. Damon Raskin, a former child actor who helps celebrities detox in rehab. "This enables their addictions and contributes to their spiral downward, as with Justin Bieber and Lindsay Lohan." Lindsay Lohan's father, who runs an addiction treatment facility in Florida, said he would never party with his daughter. Michael Lohan has been publicly critical of his ex-wife for doing that. "You can't socialize with your kids," Michael Lohan said. "You can't attend events and party with them." Lohan missed out on some of his daughter's childhood when he served prison time in connection with a Wall Street insider trading investigation. He also had his own substance abuse issues, which were addressed in rehab. The parent of another successful young actress -- who at age 20 has never been in trouble -- replied "Oh, hell no!" when asked if she would ever party with her daughter. "You can't party with your kid," she said. "You have to keep your position as a parent." She asked to remain anonymous so as not to embarrass her daughter. Richard Taite is the founder and CEO of Cliffside Malibu, the rehab facility where Lindsay Lohan was treated last year. He cites a "truism that never changes." "When parents raise their children with a healthy boundary and recognize that they are not to be this child's friend, but to be their parent, what happens is, these children grow up to be well-adjusted," Taite said. "We look at them as stars, but the reality is they are still children, and children crave boundaries. If you're going to be their friend primarily, and you just happen to be a parent, then don't be shocked when your children grow up with social adjustment issues." Unnatural role reversal Parents of a young star often leave their own jobs to travel with their children as they make movies or perform on concert tours. "The parent can no longer work because they run around with them, and sometimes the kids realize that and it's unnatural," the previously quoted mother said. "They let the kid turn wild because they feel guilty, because they are not working." A mother is needed to do things the manager or agent won't do, such as helping them study scripts and run lines with them between scenes, she said. "No agent does that." But even if parents keep their own careers, their child's income can far exceed their own. This role reversal can leave a parent powerless to enforce rules. "It's hard for the parent to have control when the kid knows they're making more money than them," she said. "If he wants to go to a party, he's going to use that." This mother shared the story of another parent who put her foot down when her 16-year-old actress daughter refused to clean up her bedroom. The teen suggested the maid could do it. The mom called the producer of her hit TV series and told him the actress would not be showing that day until she cleaned her room. The producer agreed to shoot around the young actress that day. The daughter cleaned the room after that, she said. It's a move many parents are afraid of making, out of fear it could cost their child work in the future. "Parents afraid to upset the system," the mother said. No one to say 'No' "These kids need structure," Raskin said. "They need boundaries. They need to be told 'no'. Sometimes the parents are missing, emotionally abandoning them, being too involved in their own lives. There is no one to say 'no' if your parent can't say 'no' to you." Justin Bieber needs "someone who is willing to piss him off," the actress's mother said. "A good parent has to do that." It's something she does regularly with her daughter, even though she's now legally an adult. "It's no secret -- we battle," she said. Michael Lohan said it is "important to steer them into the right direction" about who they should associate with, but it is "hard to control that." It's the "parasites that come around them" at night that cause problems, he said. Another problem is that the bodyguards -- who are suppose to protect them -- party with them and help to cover it up, Lohan said. Momagers and predators When a performer turns 18 in California, he or she is handed the checkbook to the trust fund where 15% of their earnings have been deposited under the state's "Coogan Act." The law was written to protect them from the fate of Jackie Coogan, who made a fortune as a child actor in silent films, but his parents spent the money before he became an adult. These 18-year-olds are also given the freedom make their own business decisions. It's almost a ritual for managers, agents, lawyers and publicists to approach them with the advice that they ditch their parents as advisers, the actress's mother said. "When they are almost 18, they have secret lunches and they tell your kids 'You need to leave your parents,'" she said. "The parents have no power then." Her own daughter only told her a year later that her manager "took her to lunch and said she needed to get away from mom," she said. "The agents turned because I was putting pressure on them, because they didn't have a plan for her at 17 and 18," the mother said. "When you make them do their job, then you become the enemy." Michael Lohan told a similar story about his daughter when she was almost 18 and making the movie "Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen." Justin's mom: 'He's just Justin to me' Justin Bieber's mother Pattie Mallette told CNN's Anderson Cooper in a 2012 interview that she "didn't want him even to know it was an option" to be in the entertainment industry. However, it was his mother who first put his videos on YouTube, which led to his discovery by manager Scooter Braun. She moved with him from Canada to Atlanta where Braun launched Bieber's remarkable career. "Parenting him is, I think, like anybody parenting a child," Mallette told HLN a year ago. "We just have a different set of circumstances. It doesn't affect me at all. His lifestyle has different circumstances that we have to work around, but he's just Justin to me." Mallette told USAToday that she's always been protective of her son. "You hear all the horror stories about kids and teenagers in this industry, and I didn't want to throw my son to the wolves. I've done my best to protect him and surround him with good people." Michelle Obama: 'I'd pull him close' First lady Michelle Obama, mother of two girls, was asked by Univision Radio host Enrique Santos on Friday what she would do if Justin Bieber was her son. "I'd pull him close," Obama said. "I don't know if it would be advice as much as action. I would be very present in his life right now and I would be probably with him a good chunk of the time, just there to talk, to figure out what's going on in his head, to figure out who's in his life and who's not." Her daughters "just want me near, they want that advice from a parent," she said. "They want to see you on a daily basis." Taite's suggestion for Justin Bieber does not involve his parents. He should have a talk with the Justin Bieber of 15 years from now. "What he has to do is have a moment of truth and sit down and recognize that his 35-year-old self would be bitch-slapping him right now," the rehab owner said. Bieber also should find "the best, top notch therapist he humanely, possibly can in the industry, who is desensitized to who he is," Taite said.

The series, shot entirely on location, airs on CNN on Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT. Follow the show on Twitter and Facebook. (CNN) -- The Mississippi Delta is a storied region that sets the standard for all things Southern, good and bad. The hospitality can be effusive, almost overwhelming, and the food is delicious and more varied than the usual deep-fried clichs. King Cotton sprouted from the fertile farmland that still dominates the region, as did the hard-luck chants of the field workers that evolved into America's original music form: the blues. But the Delta has another, less kindly reputation. The Civil War and the civil rights struggle left deep wounds and, even today, some of America's most brutal, entrenched poverty and racism thrives here. Agriculture jobs have been drying up since mechanization replaced human labor, and foreign competition continues to drive out other local industries. Since 1940, the Delta's population has shrunk by nearly half. Yet for all its woes, visitors flock here from all over the world to soak up the raw authenticity -- in rollicking juke joints, plate-lunch cafes and boarded-up towns with markers revealing the stories of blues legends, civil rights heroes and history-making moments that changed the nation. Living in the Delta is hard. Touring it is easy -- as long as you're not shy about asking the insiders you meet along the way for tips. They're always happy to share, and they will often bend your ear with colorful stories for as long as you've got the time to listen. Here are 10 things to know about the Delta: 1. Geography shapes the culture. This leaf-shaped section in the northwest quadrant of Mississippi is bordered by the Mississippi River to the west and the ridgeline of hills to the east, just beyond the Yazoo River. The delta is formed by the confluence of the two main rivers just below Vicksburg. The Delta essayist David Cohn summed up his native region more prosaically when he wrote that "the Mississippi Delta begins in the lobby of the Peabody Hotel in Memphis and ends on Catfish Row in Vicksburg." A 250-mile stretch of Highway 61 -- also known as the Blues Highway -- connects these two landmarks: one a legendary plush hotel, the other a riverbank once occupied by shacks that have since been replaced by a children's park. Those north and south endpoints also represent opposite ends of the social spectrum: the very wealthy white planters and the very poor black laborers. This economic gap has always been part of the region's identity. Rather than disguise it, Delta leaders have put that painful past out for the world to see. The gravesite of Fannie Lou Hamer, who fought for African-Americans' right to vote, has been turned into a historic site. The Emmett Till Memorial Commission of Tallahatchie County offers a driving tour of the events surrounding the 1955 racially-motivated murder of a 14-year-old African-American boy accused of whistling at a white woman. The courthouse in Sumner, where an all-white, all-male jury found two white men not guilty of the killing, will soon be opened as a museum in the victim's honor. 2. The Mississippi Delta's unofficial capital is in Tennessee.  Memphis, which stands on a bluff just across the Mississippi state line, was built on the cotton fortunes from the rich farmland to the south. It's the logical place to begin a Delta adventure. In its early days, Delta slaves, and later sharecroppers, grew and picked the cotton; Memphis businessmen marketed and sold it. Likewise, the blues songs that grew organically in Mississippi fields became sheet music, and later recordings, in Memphis, inspiring Elvis Presley and other rock 'n' roll pioneers. The connection between the city and its rural neighbors remains palpable -- in the music, the food and the hospitality. Stroll along Beale Street, the historic gathering place for early blues musicians that's now one of the state's biggest tourist attractions. Stax Museum, Sun Studio, the Memphis Rock 'n' Soul Museum, the Gibson Guitar Factory and Graceland further amplify the significance of the blues on American music. Check out the sobering exhibits at the National Civil Rights Museum at the Lorraine Motel where Martin Luther King Jr. was shot. 3. Once out of Memphis, the terrain turns startlingly flat.  That's because it is a floodplain. There are no superhighways; most of the thoroughfares are pencil-straight two-lane blacktops. Photo ops of old tumbledown shacks and other relics abound. Film crews love it, too. "The Help" was one of many movies filmed here, and the city of Greenwood still offers tours where the scenes were shot. With so little traffic, the temptation to step on the gas pedal is great. But don't do it. You never know when an errant deer might pop into your headlights. 4. Big Muddy is the Delta's lifeblood.  A grassy levee forms a wall concealing the Mississippi River from the main thoroughfares, so you might forget it's there. But its impact is evident everywhere you turn. It has delivered the region abundance and washed it away in cataclysmic floods. Steamboats brought ethnic influences from all over. Italian, Lebanese, Jewish and Chinese communities thrived. It also created a culture for gambling, which became legal in the early '90s and helped jump-start its economy. Neon-lit casinos transformed Tunica County, once so impoverished it was dubbed "America's Ethiopia," into "the Las Vegas of the South." There are other ways to experience river culture that don't involve slot machines. On the Sunflower River in downtown Clarksdale, John Ruskey of Quapaw Canoe Company leads river expeditions in hand-carved boats. 5. Antebellum mansions are rarities. Most of the stately plantation homes were destroyed by flood or fire and the ones that remain are largely abandoned. Tourists seeking the white-columned grandeur of the mint julep set must keep driving until they reach Vicksburg, home of the National Military Park and a dozen or so grand old residences standing regally atop steep hills, immaculately restored for touring. 6. The blues are alive and well. Much of the credit for the explosion in blues tourism goes to actor Morgan Freeman, a native son who still lives in the area and has sunk a portion of his fortune into local revitalization efforts. In 2000, he and business partner Bill Luckett (who's also mayor of Clarksdale) started a fine dining restaurant called Madidi and later Ground Zero Blues Club in Clarksdale, the town most famous for cultivating blues talent. It was at the crossroads of Highways 61 and 49 in the center of town where Robert Johnson supposedly sold his soul to the devil in exchange for musical genius. Roger Stolle, a longtime blues aficionado and music promoter from St. Louis, came here soon after Freeman's ventures gained national buzz. His Cat Head Delta Blues and Folk Art store has become a magnet for blues lovers the world over. Stolle is a tireless booster of all things Delta, responsible for starting the Juke Joint Festival and many other music events. On his website, www.cathead.biz, you'll find a detailed calendar of blues-related activities. Though Madidi closed in 2012, the graffiti-covered former cotton grading warehouse that is now Ground Zero is still hopping and new restaurants and businesses keep popping up. While Ground Zero appeals to the masses (and has some great Southern food, too), blues experts like Stolle can direct you to the few remaining authentic juke joints, such as Red's Lounge a few blocks away. Po' Monkey's, farmer Willie Seaberry's backwoods sharecropper shack closer to the Delta's center near Merigold, serves beer from a cooler and has a DJ that plays blues and old-school R&B. Plastered with posters and strung with Christmas lights, with a sea of stuffed monkeys hanging from the ceiling, it provides an ambience like no other. No blues tour is complete without a stop at the state-of-the-art B.B. King Museum and Interpretive Center in Indianola, opened in 2008 to honor the blues legend's life, and the history-making events in the community where he grew up. Club Ebony, right around the corner, is the blues club where King got his start. 7. Deltans have their own style of dining.  Besides fried chicken and sweet tea, the flavors borrow heavily from New Orleans and Italy, where many of its residents can trace their roots. But dining out in the Delta is just as much about the experience as the taste. Deltans love to surround themselves with hunt club taxidermy, vintage high school class portraits and old farm equipment painted and turned into art. A love of good home-cooked food inspired Greenwood entrepreneur Fred Carl Jr. to invent a restaurant-quality home range that would become the Viking Range Corporation, his hometown's biggest business success story since the fall of cotton. The Viking-owned Alluvian is a European-style boutique hotel anchored by a historic Italian restaurant, Giardina's, arguably the classiest restaurant in the Delta. Viking's flagship cooking school across the street sealed its reputation as a sophisticated foodie magnet. Carl has since sold Viking but remains invested in other local restaurant properties. But long before Viking came to Greenwood, there was Lusco's, a former grocery store that's been serving fat steaks and butter sauce-drenched pompano since Prohibition days. Back then, planters came through the back door to eat, gamble and drink Papa Lusco's special brew in curtained rooms. The illegal hooch is gone, but the private curtained rooms with buzzers on the wall for summoning the wait staff remain. Nearby, the Crystal Grill has been drawing old-timers and newcomers alike for just as long with their Old South entrees and mile-high meringue pies. Both Lusco's and the Crystal Grill rank near the top of most Southern food bucket list recommendations, as does Doe's Eat Place in Greenville, a legendary steakhouse in a proudly run-down old grocery store that's as famous for its tamales as its porterhouses. 8. The Delta has inspired writers and artists of all genres. The region figures in the works of William Faulkner, Eudora Welty and a host of other Mississippi-born writers. Greenville in particular prides itself on its homegrown literary talent: William Alexander Percy, his nephew Walker Percy, who lived with him as a youth after his parents died; Shelby Foote, Hodding Carter, David Cohn, Angela Jackson, Ellen Douglas and Julia Reed. Willie Morris was raised in Yazoo City and Tennessee Williams spent a chunk of his childhood in Clarksdale, where a Tennessee Williams Festival is held each year. Several obscure but rewarding museums pay tribute to other notable Delta artists. Mama's Dream World museum in Belzoni shows "picture memories" of rural Delta life hand-stitched by folk artist Ethel Wright Mohamed, whose work has been displayed at the Smithsonian Institution. The Jim Henson Museum in Leland honors the Muppets creator, whose Sesame Street characters are based on the creatures he discovered on the banks of Deer Creek where he once played. Merigold is home to the world-famous McCarty's Pottery started 60 years ago in an old mule barn. 9. Unique lodging enhances the Delta experience. A night or two at the plush Alluvian in Greenwood is a luxurious treat. Other towns, especially Clarksdale, offer funkier accommodations that make you feel like you're sleeping in a museum. The Riverside Hotel, set behind a broken Schlitz sign and a blues marker noting its history as the hospital where blues singer Bessie Smith died from injuries sustained in a car wreck, is homey, hospitable and filled with nostalgia. The Shack Up Inn on the Hopson Plantation began as a few refurbished sharecroppers' shacks, and it now offers lodging in renovated cotton gin bins. An old commissary on the premises has been transformed into the Juke Joint Chapel where live music plays. Newer options continue to push the eccentricity. The Squeezebox, a former downtown storefront, has just opened as a guest suite where the dcor includes a gold-painted parking meter, a lamp with a zebra-patterned shade and a flute as a base and an X-ray table converted into a headboard with images of blues men. 10. Hot tamales are a can't-miss culinary icon.  Don't even think of leaving the Delta without trying a hot tamale! Everybody loves these spicy, cigar-shaped cylinders of meat-filled cornmeal dough. They are sold in roadside kiosks, soul food cafes and expensive steak houses as appetizers, always with saltines and hot sauce.

Tune in Sunday at 9 p.m. ET/PT as he visits Mexico. Follow the show on Twitter and Facebook. (CNN) -- Mexico City began as the home of an ancient empire and grew into a massive, modern metropolis. With more than 20 million people pulsing through its streets, it's one of the world's largest cities. That big-city bustle brings with it delicious food, massive markets and more cultural events in a day than anyone can ever keep track of. There's lavish wealth, devastating poverty and a lot to discover in Mexico's sprawling capital: 1. Looking to set a quirky record? Mexico City might be the world's best place to do it. One big perk of having so many people in the same place: It's easy to set a record if you can persuade enough of them to do the same thing at the same time. Records for the most people kissing simultaneously (39,879), the most people dancing to Michael Jackson's "Thriller" at the same time (13,597) and the world's biggest enchilada (weighing nearly 1.5 tons) have all been set inside the Mexican capital, according to Guinness World Records. 2. Gays and lesbians are welcome. For years, Latin America's deep-rooted ties to the Roman Catholic Church meant much of the region tended to take a more conservative tack when it came to homosexuality. But that's started to shift in recent years, and Mexico City has been at the forefront. Same-sex marriage is legal there. So is adoption by same-sex couples. And the city has marketed itself as a destination for gay tourists. In 2010, the city offered a free honeymoon to Latin America's first gay couple to wed. 3. You might have heard about the smog. They're working on it. Pollution in Mexico City used to be so bad that children painting pictures of the sky reportedly would color it gray, not blue. Because of its geographic location -- in a valley between mountains -- and the sheer number of cars traveling its streets, smog is a problem the city is still battling. But with government programs that encourage bike-riding and limit the number of days motorists can take to the streets, longtime residents say the pollution problem is much better than it used to be. Another innovative solution debuted last year: a hospital tower covered with a facade designed to "eat smog," breaking down pollutants when the sun hits it. Designers say the tiles on the facade of the Manuel Gea Gonzalez Hospital neutralize the effects of 1,000 cars every day. 4. The city was built on a lake. It's hard to imagine now, but much of the sprawling concrete jungle that now makes up Mexico City was once a large lake. The Aztecs constructed a massive civilization there, with Tenochtitlan serving as the capital. That city, which started out on an island and expanded to include reclaimed parts of the lake, thrived until the Spanish conquest. After winning the battle for control of the area in 1521, Spaniards destroyed Tenochtitlan and built Mexico City on top of its ruins, using canals and roads from the Aztec city as the basis for new streets and eventually draining the lake. But they didn't entirely erase the past. That's made for some fascinating ancient finds as Mexico City grew into a modern urban metropolis. In 1978, electrical company workers digging near the city's central square came upon an Aztec relic. That led to archaeologists unearthing ruins of the Templo Mayor, an Aztec temple that's now a popular tourist destination in Mexico City. 5. It's sinking. It turns out the dried-out bed of a big lake isn't the best foundation for building construction. If you want proof, take a look at some of Mexico City's most iconic structures. The sloped floor and a swinging pendulum inside the Metropolitan Cathedral show that the building is decidedly tilted. Head up Reforma Avenue to the Angel of Independence, and you'll need to walk up steps that the city built over the years as the area around the 1910 monument sank. Government officials have estimated that the city is sinking at a rate of 10 centimeters (4 inches) per year. A recent government report (PDF) estimated that Mexico City has sunk 10 meters (32.8 feet) in the past 60 years. 6. One of the world's richest men lives here. Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim topped Forbes Magazine's list of the world's richest men for four years. Microsoft founder Bill Gates reclaimed the No. 1 spot this year. But Slim and his family, with an estimated net worth of $71.4 billion, are still sitting comfortably in second place. Slim lives in Mexico City, and many of the companies he controls are based there, too. Even if you're just passing through the city, you're bound to come across his holdings. Talking on a Mexican cell phone? It's pretty likely that it's tied to Slim's company, Telcel, which controls 70% of Mexico's wireless market. Swinging by a department store? If you spend any time in Mexico City, you'll probably find a reason to stop at Sanborns, Slim's ubiquitous chain that contains restaurants, pharmacies and retail goods. Admiring beautiful buildings in the city's historic center? Slim helped finance a major facelift there in recent years. 7. It's safer than some parts of the country. Many Mexicans used to fear traveling to their nation's capital, concerned about crime. Street assaults and kidnapping are still major worries for residents and visitors. And in high-end neighborhoods, you might find a store selling bulletproof glass near a designer clothing boutique. But the city's homicide rate is on par with other major metropolises around the world. And with drug violence plaguing other parts of the country, Mexico City has actually earned a reputation as one of the safer places to go. 8. It's not just tacos and tequila. Don't expect to find much cheesy Tex-Mex fare here. The Mexico City culinary scene is muy caliente, with fancy restaurants in posh hotels and top chefs saying they come here for inspiration. Pujol, a restaurant in the city's posh Polanco neighborhood, ranks among the world's top eateries. But it's not all about fine dining. Market stalls and street stands serve up some of the city's most delicious food. If you're looking for tequila, it's not hard to get it. But if you want to drink like a local, try mezcal or pulque. All three drinks are made from agave plants. Tequila comes from blue agave. Mezcal can be made from different types of agave plants and has become a popular drink for hipsters in Mexico's capital. So has pulque, a 2,000-year-old Aztec drink made from fermented but undistilled agave juice. 9. The subway is fast, cheap and fascinating. While many businessmen and foreigners who live in the city rely on taxis and car services, Mexico City's metro is still the most popular way to get around for the masses. Protests after authorities announced plans to raise fees last year weren't successful. But taking the subway is still pretty cheap: just 5 pesos (about 40 cents) for a ticket. And it's not just a way to get from point A to point B. For some people, stations on the city's 12 subway lines are a destination. There are shops, libraries, art exhibits and even computer labs inside. A pedestrian tunnel between two subway stations in the heart of the city boasts more than 40 bookstores. 10. It's not all loud noise and concrete.  If you need a break from the bustle, it takes only a short subway ride in Mexico City to reach places where you'll feel like you stepped back in time. Neighborhoods like San Angel and Coyoacan (where artists Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo made their home) have cobblestone streets, beautiful buildings and quaint cafes that will give you a chance to catch your breath.

The series, shot entirely on location, airs on CNN on Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT. Follow the show on Twitter and Facebook. (CNN) -- Paris, we can all agree, has a lot going for it. It has splendid museums, grand avenues, a famous pointy tower and thousands of cafes where you can order a minuscule coffee for a fairly large amount of money. But Lyon is a supremely qualified rival. In Lyon, a hearty serving of tradition Smaller it may be, but France's second city has a sophistication that makes it a hugely intriguing option for visitors. While the following suggestions may cause rioting (or, at least, mild shrugs of indifference) along the Champs-Elysees, there are a number of ways Lyon outshines the French capital. Eight, in fact. 1. Wine Just about everyone in France loves wine. But in contrast to Paris -- which sips anything fruity put in front of it, but doesn't produce anything of its own -- Lyon brings a bottle to the party. A lot of bottles. Lyon is the gateway to the Beaujolais viticultural region, which fans out immediately to the northwest. From Lyon, you can explore these whispering vineyards yourself. Or you can take the easy route and make a few wise purchases in the excellent wine shops around the city. Cave Chromatique does flavorsome reds and whites, while La Cave des Vins Magnifiques is hardly short on confidence when it comes to the contents of its stock list. 2. Notre Dames Paris's Notre Dame Cathedral is an inimitable French icon, especially if you like long lines and pigeons. Lyon's Notre Dame -- the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourviere -- is, simply, a more beautiful church. A young maiden (built 1872-1884) compared with Paris's grande dame (built 1163-1345), she sits prettily atop the city's main hill, offering views down to the riverside streets below, and, on clear days, across to the snowcaps of the Alps. 3. Outdoor music Lyon knows how to put on a summer extravaganza. The Nuits de Fourviere festival sees 60 or so shows -- rock, classical music, drama -- stretched across the warm evenings of June and July. Alumni of this wide showcase include Lou Reed, Bjork and Sting. The 2014 lineup includes French pop stalwarts Phoenix and U.S. indie veterans the Pixies. Better than any band, though, is a setting that Paris can't match. The French capital may have modern venues befitting its size and status, but it can't dance the night away as if Caesar Augustus were still in the posh seats. The majority of the Nuits de Fourviere performances take place amid the sturdy tiers of Lyon's main Roman amphitheater, which dates to 15 B.C. 4. Cinematic history Paris has been in many movies. "Moulin Rouge." "Amelie." "Midnight in Paris." But Lyon pretty much invented the movies. Or, at least, two of its most famous sons did. Auguste and Louis Lumiere are credited with creating the first film camera (the cinematograph) in 1892. You can pay tribute to their vision at Lyon's Institut Lumiere, with its museum and cinema. 5. Food Paris is very good at cuisine. It's just that Lyon believes it's better. It may well be. Its restaurants include L'Auberge du Pont de Collonges, a fabled temple of Gallic gastronomy which has three Michelin stars. It's overseen by French uber-chef Paul Bocuse, who is now 88, but still a master at his signature truffle soup. Then there's La Mere Brazier, which exists under the gaze of Mathieu Viannay. The restaurant has two Michelin stars, but Viannay is only 46, so can be excused his shortfall. 6. Parks Paris doesn't have a large central green space -- unless you count the Jardins des Tuileries, which are predominantly surfaced in gravel, and are therefore white. But Lyon has the Parc de la Tete d'Or, which -- with its 117 hectares of grass and trees -- cozies up to the Rhone in the sixth arrondissement. Here, you can go boating on the lake, cycle along winding pathways, or simply lie in the shade and remark on the fact that this metropolitan lung's name -- Park of the Golden Head -- sounds a bit silly in English. 7. Roman history In numbers, this is basically a tie. Julius Caesar stomped his sandals into the fledgling Paris in 52 B.C.; Lyon had its first date with expansionist toga-wearing proto-Italians when it was founded as Lugdunum a decade later in 43 B.C. But Lyon was the more important city under Roman rule -- a teacher's pet that became Rome's head boy in ancient Gaul. This still shows. Lyon's Roman structures are almost as impressive today as they were in the days of the gladiators -- especially the remnants of its public baths and the giant amphitheater on Fourviere hill at the Gallo-Roman Museum.  8. Rivers Why did the Romans plonk Lugdunum onto the map where they did? Because the place was ideal for a settlement. West of the Alps, it was a decent stop-off point halfway up France and not too far from the mother city. But above that, because it had -- and has -- two rivers. The Rhone, which is so long that it has to travel from Switzerland, curves through the center of Lyon. So does the Saone. The two meet in the aptly titled district of Confluence. Paris, by contrast, has just one river, the Seine. Ah, c'est dommage.

The heart of anyone who stumbles on one must race with the thrill of discovery as well as a terror of encountering creatures in the dark. Formed by geological processes over thousands of years, caves in the United States were often used by Native Americans well before Europeans arrived. Though mapped, excavated and fitted with lights and guard rails, "show caves" -- those open to the public for tours -- are still fascinating to explore, especially when the sun burns hot above. Underground streams, spectacular rock formations and cool, consistent temperatures of about 44 F to 56 F (about 7 F to 13 C) lure visitors underground. Here are eight spectacular U.S. caves: Carlsbad Caverns 
Carlsbad, New Mexico The most famous of America's underground destinations is the 46,000-acre Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico. Visitors can take a self-guided tour of the main rooms, or a ranger-led foray into creepily named niches such as the Hall of the White Giant, the Rookery and Spider Cave. Speaking of creepy, swarms of bats make a great show for visitors during summertime, leaving the cave each evening and returning in the early hours; call the park (575-785-3012) for exact times to watch their flight. Entrance fee is $10 for adults, free for children 15 and under. Guided tours are extra and vary in difficulty, length and age requirements. For guided tour reservations, call 877-444-6777 or visit recreation.gov. Glenwood Caverns 
Glenwood Springs, Colorado In the 1890s, the Fairy Caves in Glenwood Springs became some of the first caves in the world lit with electric lights. Following an 82-year closure, they reopened in 1999, and today visitors ride gondolas up a 4,300-foot tramway to the entrance. The original Fairy Caves, which contain nooks such as the Exclamation Point lookout and Eternal Towers underground canyon, were damaged by exposure early on but are undergoing gradual restoration. The fully preserved Glenwood Caverns section can be seen on foot or via a more challenging crawling tour. Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park also offers thrill rides such as roller coasters and the Giant Canyon Swing. Entrance and cave tour are $25 for adults, $20 for children; Wild Cave Tour $60. 800-530-1635; www.glenwoodcaverns.com Luray Caverns 
Luray, Virginia At Luray Caverns in the Shenandoah Valley you'll find resplendent limestone formations, cascading like endless dollops of rich ice cream. They're also reminiscent of giant church organs, and in the 1950s mathematician Leland Sprinkle rigged up the Great Stalacpipe Organ, a contraption with mallets that strike stalactites to produce an otherworldly sound. It's played for every tour by an automated system. Admission -- including tour and entrance to Luray Valley Museum -- is $29 adults, $17 children 6-12 and free for children 5 and under. Tickets to a Garden Maze and Rope Adventure Park on site can be bought separately. 540-743-6551; www.luraycaverns.com Howe Caverns 
Howes Cave, New York In a pasture 40 miles west of Albany in 1842, Lester Howe noticed his cows gathered on a spot where cool breezes could be felt. His investigations led him into dark recesses extending 15 stories below ground, including a subterranean lake extending for a quarter mile. Contemporary visitors to Howe Caverns can take a 90-minute walking tour with boat ride, a two-hour lantern tour that recreates the lighting of Howe's early descents, or a two-hour spelunking tour. The traditional tour is $25 adults, $13-$21 for children 5-15 and free for children under 5. Reservations are required on lantern and spelunking tours, which are $35 and $108, respectively, and have age and fitness requirements. Outside attractions such as a rock wall, air jumper and ropes course are ticketed separately. 518-296-8900; www.howecaverns.com Niagara Cave 
Harmony, Minnesota Like Niagara Falls, Niagara Cave has made a name for itself as a home for romance and matrimony: Its underground wedding chapel has been the site of more than 400 nuptials. Located in Minnesota's Amish country southeast of the Twin Cities, the cave also boasts a 60-foot waterfall. Well-preserved marine fossils dating back hundreds of millions of years are another highlight of the hourlong tour, which costs $14 for adults, $8 for children 4-12, and is free for children 3 and under. 800-837-6606; www.niagracave.com Oregon Caves 
Cave Junction, Oregon Nicknamed "the Marble Halls of Oregon," the Oregon Caves National Monument is one of the few marble caverns to be found. It features rooms such as Paradise Lost, the Ghost Room and Banana Grove; an underground stream called the River Styx; and hunger-inducing formations named for popcorn, bacon and soda straws. Discovered by a 19th-century bear hunter, the cave contains the 50,000-year-old remnants of a grizzly, among other fossils. Tours are $8.50 for adults, $6 for 16 and under. Children must be 42 inches or taller to take part in the 90-minute guided cave tour, which covers 500 stairs and climbs 230 feet. Spelunking tours are available by reservation for $30 per person. 541-592-2100; www.nps.gov/orca Marengo Cave 
Marengo, Indiana Accounts of Marengo Cave's discovery differ in their details, but the story of a young brother and sister who ventured in with candles in 1883 is enchanting enough to be represented on the attraction's logo. Choose from a 40- or 60-minute guided walking tour; the latter takes in the Penny Ceiling, an upside-down wishing well where coins tossed upward stick to thick silt. Tours are $14.50-$16.50 for adults, $8-$9 for children 12 and under. Also: cave exploring tours for $29-$99 per person and canoe trips on the nearby Blue River. 888-702-2837; www.marengocave.com Penn's Cave 
Centre Hall, Pennsylvania Don't feel like trekking? Consider Penn's Cave, where you cruise along an underground stream, watching trout swim below and formations drift by. One stalagmite is dubbed "the Statue of Liberty," but these caves were known well before that landmark was built. A fanciful legend describes an 18th-century French trapper who eloped with the Indian maiden Nita-Nee against Indian custom and was left to perish in the cave's far reaches. Tours cost $17.50 for adults, $9.25 for children 2-12, children under 2 free. Combination tickets also cover a bus tour of the adjacent wildlife park. 814-364-8778; www.pennscave.com .

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/09/travel/visiting-all-50-states/index.html	travel	Alabama crowns 50-state odyssey - CNN.com	2014/05/09	Friday May 9 08:19:21 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Have you visited all 50 states? Or are you close to checking them all off? Share your stories with CNN iReport. (CNN) -- When my airplane touched down in Birmingham, Alabama, I could not stop grinning. The trip last weekend fulfilled a lifelong dream to visit all 50 states. At age 31, I reached my goal. Alabama may not be at the top of many travel wish lists -- it wasn't on mine -- but its layered history offers many memorable experiences. I took an airport selfie right away, holding a map of the USA on which I proudly wrote, "I've been to ALL 50 states!" It's a map my dad pulled out of a phone book when I was a kid, penciling in the year we checked off each state. I've carried that simple map along on my travels, slowly filling it in. Collecting states is a family tradition. My sister Mary reached 50 states when she was 21 and two of my uncles reached it in their 40s. My father has been to 49 states and my mother has been to 48. By the time I was a year old, I had been to 10 states, and by the time I was seven, I'd visited 25. Over the past four years, I've traveled frequently for work, often visiting 20 to 25 states a year, and I have been to most states multiple times. There's a lot of debate around what counts as a visit. Some people believe you need to stay overnight or eat a meal. Others count airport layovers. In my family, we say you need to stand on the ground in the state. Despite all of my travel, I've had to make a handful of dashes across a border to cross off a state still on my list, but even those trips create lasting memories. When I was 22, my cousin Maureen drove my sister, other relatives and me from her home in Memphis across the borders of Mississippi and Arkansas. The occasion for our visit was very sad: Her mother had just died from ovarian cancer. But driving us to neighboring states is what her mom would have done if she were alive to help us with our goal, Maureen said. For North Dakota, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, I tacked solo road trips onto business travel in neighboring states, driving up to 600 miles round-trip just to check off a state. In the other 45 states, I've spent time meeting people who live there, sampling the food and the local attractions. I've had Whoopie pies in Maine, Skyline Chili in Ohio, hush puppies in North Carolina, fried dill pickles in Texas, huckleberry ice cream in Montana and poke in Hawaii. 50 states, 50 spots for 2014 I've lived in seven states from coast to coast, and I don't identify any one of them as home. The nation is my home, with its diverse landscapes, communities and landmarks. Plus, a college degree in history heightened my curiosity about the places I've studied. History is filled with a mixture of tragedy and triumph, and Alabama certainly fits. Capping off my American tour in Alabama was a meaningful way to end, but in truth visiting Heart of Dixie last was accidental. I thought a trip to a wedding in Hawaii with my partner Mark in January would fulfill my goal and I even bragged about it on Facebook. But then I dug up my dad's map on the day of our flight and saw that both Alabama and New Mexico were blank. Oops. So the quest continued. I visited New Mexico in February and my mom said she'd meet me in Alabama in May. She flew from Florida while I came from Virginia. We planned a trip centered around heroines of history and literature. In Montgomery, we stood at the very spot where Rosa Parks boarded the racially segregated bus in 1955 and refused to give up her seat. A number of other women, many of whom worked at the nearby university, had been brainstorming a bus boycott and jumped into action that night. After 13 months, their boycott worked. We drove down to Monroeville, the hometown of Harper Lee, where we watched a play based on her 1960 book "To Kill a Mockingbird" at the courthouse that inspired the setting in her book. The 1903 courthouse is now a museum with exhibits about Lee and her famous neighbor Truman Capote. This literary classic ranks among my favorite books, and it felt likes stepping back in time to see the volunteer actors perform it in Lee's hometown. Before the performance, we followed a walking tour map to Mel's Dairy Bar, the spot where Lee's childhood home had once stood and paid silent homage to her. The literary tour continued in Irondale because my mom and I love the Towanda-power of the movie "Fried Green Tomatoes" (1991) and the book that inspired it, "Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Caf" (1987) by Fannie Flagg. Flagg's great aunt co-owned the Irondale Caf, which was the inspiration for the fictional caf. As a steady stream of trains whistled by, we tucked into greasy, tasty fried green tomatoes and other Southern cuisine. Back in Birmingham, we took another look at some of the state's most troubling past at the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church -- where four girls died in a bombing -- and Kelly Ingram Park -- where white people attacked unarmed black children protesting segregation. Both events occurred in 1963 at the height of the civil rights movement. Visiting the sites highlighted for us the bravery of those seeking equality and the brutality of those who opposed them. We spent hours at the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. When we started, there were students running all around us, noisily doing a scavenger hunt, but by the end, we were alone, absorbed in the exhibits. . From slavery to segregation to the heroic tactics to end it, the institute tells the gripping, moving story of change through printed words, audio clips and film. Women were appropriately honored for their crucial role, especially their on-the-ground organizing, something that too many history books and people overlook. From visiting national parks and historic landmarks to meeting kind and interesting people in big cities and small towns alike, I've had many memorable trips. But learning more about and honoring women I admire, both real and fictional, with the added benefit of spending time with my mother, puts the Alabama weekend near the top of the list. And of course, thanks to this trip I finally have the bragging rights to say I've been to all 50 states! Do you have a 50-state goal?

http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/22/travel/nature-must-see-shows/index.html	travel	15 of nature's most spectacular shows - CNN.com	2014/04/22	Tuesday Apr 22 08:08:13 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Fireworks are fantastic and human endeavor has its place, but sometimes Mother Nature outshines any performance we can produce. Check out 15 of our favorite nature shows and a spot where you can witness them. While a few involve a bit of human enterprise or cultivation, most are pretty wild and easily eclipse anything Hollywood can dream up. Glowing phytoplankton Where else can you walk on the beach at night and leave nothing but blue, sparkling footprints? Visit Vaadhoo Island where millions of blue starry lights gleam in the crashing surf. The small island is part of the Raa Atoll in the stunning Maldives archipelago in the Indian Ocean. The lights emanate from tiny marine microbes which, when jostled by the ocean waters, create a cellular-level chemical reaction that emits light. The effect is startling and romantic and even disorienting when, on starry nights, the ocean appears to mirror the sky. Stay nearby at the ultra-luxurious Conrad Maldives Rangali Island resort, which spans two islands and features an all-glass undersea restaurant. Day trips to surrounding islands are also available. 10 record-setting natural wonders in the U.S. Monarch butterfly migration  Tucked 60 miles northwest of Mexico City in the Sierra Madre is the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve, a sanctuary for millions of monarch butterflies that migrate here yearly from east of the Rocky Mountains. Nearly 35 million monarch butterflies make the 3,000 mile trip from Canada and North America to warmer winter climates. The best time to visit the reserve is late October through early November when most butterflies have arrived. Take a walking tour of the land around the reserve and watch thousands of these orange-winged beauties cling to the fir trees and dine on milkweed. Grab a bike and take a ride on approved trails, enjoy the scenery on horseback, dine on local cuisine and book a zipline tour, widely available in the region. The most insane new U.S. roller coasters Aurora borealis Glimpses of this spectacular light show are visible in the Northern Hemisphere's auroral zone near the northern magnetic pole. These swirling lights -- mostly green, but red and blue lights glow at higher altitudes -- are produced when charged particles in the magnetosphere and solar wind collide with atoms. While it's hard to predict when the northern lights will come out to play, we recommend looking for them in Norway from September to March, where you can chase the aurora borealis by boat, snowmobile, dog sled, snowshoe trek or minibus. Try heading to the pristine Svalbard Islands in the Arctic Ocean, bunking in a rustic hotel such as Mary-Ann's Polarrigg and booking a moonlight glacier walk or a dog sledding expedition. 29 beach photos that'll make you drool Cherry blossoms Each April the South Korean city of Changwon is transformed by nearly 360,000 blossoming cherry trees with light pink and white blossoms that flutter from the trees and cover the ground like a light, spring snowfall. The city celebrates the beauty with a 10-day cherry blossom festival in the Jinhae area that attracts more than a million visitors. Take a monorail up Mount Jehwang to Jinhae Tower, where you can see a panoramic view of this naval port city and the magnificent blooms. Take a day excursion out of Jinhae Bay to see fishermen haul in a catch, or watch one of several military parades. It's recommended that visitors walk, bike or take a train to avoid traffic snarls. Glacier calving  Watching chunks of ice the size of buildings peel off glaciers and plunge into the icy waters of Alaska's Glacier Bay National Park will set your pulse racing. Take a boat tour into the chilly waters and get a look at the mighty glaciers that began forming here nearly 4,000 years ago during the Little Ice Age. Today, many of the glaciers are melting, especially on the east and southwest sides of the bay, which can yield some pretty impressive calving. Consider booking a flight over Glacier Bay National Park, or go for a hike on established trails near Bartlett Cove. Plan to visit in early summer when rainfall is diminished Volcanic eruptions Travel to the South Pacific island nation of Vanuatu for a peek at one of the world's most accessible (once you get there) and active volcanoes: Mount Yasur. Located on Tanna Island, this volcano has been erupting nearly continuously since at least the 18th century. Despite Mount Yasur's frequent eruptions, the ferocity of its explosions is fairly subdued, allowing visitors to regularly approach the volcano's crater. But as with any of nature's unpredictable outbursts, this natural fireworks show is not without risk. Book a day tour or plan an overnight excursion on which you can follow a guide to the crater and watch molten magma spark while the sun sets and the stars emerge overhead. Or book a flight over the simmering volcano and get the view of a lifetime. Monkey temple  Some of nature's shows are intriguing for the strange juxtaposition of wild and man-made. Carved into a mountain pass outside Jaipur in the Rajasthan state in India is a Hindu temple site complete with seven bathing tanks fed by natural springs and tribes of macaque and langur monkeys who climb the stone structure and reside in the hallowed halls. The main temple building at the Galtaji complex is constructed of pink stone and there are a number of architecturally interesting pavilions, two-tier man-made waterfalls and painted walls. But what many find charming about this crumbling temple are the monkeys who peek at visitors from around stone columns and eagerly and unabashedly eat the snacks visitors offer. In Jaipur, arrange a motorbike or tuk tuk (three-wheel motorcycle with driver) to make the short drive to the temple gates. Tulip fields Stroll hand-in-hand through vast tulip, daffodil and hyacinth fields in the world's largest garden in Lisse, Holland. Known as Keukenhof, or "kitchen garden," this flower extravaganza covers 79 acres and boasts more than 7 million flower bulbs planted yearly. Open only from mid-March to mid-May, the Keukenhof treats visitors to a variety of garden styles, including an English-style landscape complete with intimate winding paths. Built in 1642, the Castle Keukenhof stands directly opposite the magnificent gardens. Order a simple meal from a caf in the park and have a picnic lunch among the blooms. Bear feast  This spectacle is a two-for-one: As the sockeye salmon run really gets going at Alaska's Katmai National Park and Preserve, so, too, does bear feasting. In late June, sockeye salmon begin their return from the ocean, swimming upstream where they eventually deposit their young in the gravel river and lake bottoms where they were born. The salmon may return en masse in part to overwhelm the bears, who can't possibly eat them all. But the resident brown bears give it their best shot, and the feeding can be frenzied. Visit Katmai's Brooks Camp in July or September when "bears are everywhere," according to the National Park Service. One of the top brown bear viewing spots in the world, Katmai is home to about 2,200 brown bears. There are three viewing platforms in the camp along the Brooks River where the bears gather to gobble up salmon. Be sure to give them plenty of space and get familiar with bear safety before your trip. To get to Brooks Camp, fly a commercial airline from Anchorage to King Salmon and then take KatmaiAir to Brooks Camp. Stay at Brooks Lodge or the Brooks Camp campground. Geysers  Yellowstone National Park in the United States contains the world's largest collection of geysers, which are caused by natural plumbing constrictions combined with water and steam heated by magma under the Earth's surface. Old Faithful is the most famous of the park's geothermal attractions, spewing water and steam roughly every 90 minutes up to about 180 feet high. Because of its predictability, it is one of the most scientifically studied geysers in the world. Just behind Old Faithful in Yellowstone's Upper Basin is Beehive Geyser. It is a less predictable geyser, but it has an impressive eruption. While you're visiting Yellowstone, make sure to check out Yellowstone Lake, the largest high-altitude lake in the continental United States. Check in at Lake Yellowstone Hotel, a luxurious, historic and oft-renovated structure that dates back to 1891. Wildebeest migration Often termed the Great Migration, millions of wildebeest, zebra and gazelle thunder through northern Tanzania and Kenya each year in search of food, water and breeding grounds. One of the best ways to view this massive movement is to join a mobile safari that allows people to keep up with the fast-moving herds. From April to December, the Serengeti's wildebeest are on the move seeking fresh grasslands and water, and they only stop migrating from December to early April to feed and birth their young. One of the most magnificent scenes of the Great Migration occurs in September when the herds come face-to-face with the wild Mara River in the northern Serengeti and must plow through its strong currents and crocodile-infested waters. Consider the Sayari Camp to be close to the river crossings. Perseid meteor shower  Every year from mid-July through late August the Earth rotates through space debris left from the Swift-Tuttle Comet and gives us a beautiful show in the dark night sky. The Swift-Tuttle is the largest known object, roughly six miles in diameter, to make repeated passes near Earth. Best viewed in clear, predawn skies sometime after the first week in August, catch the show during a camping trip into the Colorado back country or any wide open space far from the lights of the city. Unfortunately, watchers will face a challenge this summer from the waning gibbous moon. Waterfall wonder  Locals call it The Smoke That Thunders, but it's widely known as Victoria Falls. Located in Zambia and Zimbabwe, it is a breathtaking sight. Victoria Falls is the largest curtain of falling water in the world, approximately twice as wide and twice as deep as Niagara Falls in North America. Daredevils may want to swim in the Devil's Pool, a small naturally formed pool just feet from the waterfall's edge. Bungee jumping and whitewater rafting are also popular activities. The waterfall is at its peak flow, and most impressive, in late spring and early summer, but the mist generated from it can make getting close and capturing great photos difficult. During these months, an air tour is a good option. Barracuda tornado  The spectacular diving off Sipadan Island in Malaysia gets dizzying as thousands of fish at Barracuda Point spin up their own tornado-like funnels. Diving companions in this part of the world might also include hammerhead sharks, manta rays and giant sea turtles. Long considered one of the top diving destinations in the world, this area features more than 3,000 species of fish and hundreds of coral species, too. Here, the bumphead parrotfish shares space with whale sharks. Turtle Cave, an undersea maze of limestone, is a sobering dive as the cave is littered with the skeletons of sea turtles that drowned as they got lost and couldn't surface. In order to preserve the pristine environment, there are no accommodations on Sipadan Island, but visitors can stay on close-by Mabul or Kapalai. Sandhill crane migration  It's a sign of spring after a quiet winter: The trumpeting of thousands of sandhill cranes on the banks of the Platte River in Kearney, Nebraska. It's estimated that nearly 350,000 sandhill cranes migrate each year, and many of them congregate in early spring, usually March, in Nebraska and "trumpet" to each other with distinctive calls. Make sure to join Audubon's Nebraska Crane Festival next year to get great views of these migratory birds. Join fellow birders on day outings to spot other feathered species or visit Fort Kearny State Historical Park.

Share your suggestions in the comments section below. (CNN) -- Maybe we've been cooped up too much this winter, but now more than ever, the natural wonders of our world are beckoning to us from behind gray computer monitors, buzzing cell phones and the million red brake lights ahead of us on the long commute home. We yearn to leave the laundry, the dishes and the bills behind and swap them out for something bigger, deeper and taller than we could ever be; something that will, at once, make us feel insignificant and perfectly in place. Pack your bags and wear comfortable shoes, because we've compiled a list of nature's record setters in the United States that will make for great vacation memories. 29 beach photos that'll make you drool Deepest lake in the U.S. Looking to be gobsmacked by nature? Visit Crater Lake in south-central Oregon. Created by the eruption and ultimate collapse of Mount Mazama more than 7,000 years ago, water filled the caldera, or ring-like indentation left after the explosion, creating the deepest lake (592 meters; 1,943 feet) in the United States. In winter, snowshoeing expeditions give a peek into the wilds of this natural wonder. But make sure to visit this beauty in the summertime, too, when more of the Crater Lake National Park is accessible. A two-hour trolley tour circles the rim of the lake and allows visitors four scheduled stops. Hop aboard a summer lake cruise, weather permitting, and catch a glimpse of the famed "Old Man of the Lake," a large tree stump that has been floating vertically in the cold water for nearly a century. Bicyclists rave about the 33-mile loop around the rim of Crater Lake, but be warned that the route features steep climbs and brilliant views in equal portion. Crater Lake Lodge first opened its doors in 1915 and is a rustic, sweeping homage to the 1920s, complete with a Great Hall and oversized fireplace. It is open seasonally, usually May to October. 10 of the world's coolest underground wonders Largest living tree in the world You're going to need a very long set of arms to hug the largest living tree in the world. Dubbed General Sherman after the Civil War general, this behemoth lives in the north end of Giant Forrest in Sequoia National Park, California, and towers about 84 meters (275 feet) high. At its base, this giant is about 31 meters (103 feet) around, roughly equal to fourteen and a half Shaquille O'Neals lying head-to-foot around the base of the tree. Despite its impressive height and width, it is not the tallest or widest tree around. Instead, its distinction as the largest living tree is judged by the volume of its huge trunk -- 52,500 cubic feet . Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks lie adjacent to each other in the southern Sierra Nevada and make a wonderful playground, no matter the season. In May, Crystal Cave, a large, naturally-forged underground cave with stream-polished rock formations and large marble rooms, opens to the public. In the winter, book a room at the rustic John Muir Lodge, located just minutes from General Sherman, and take a cross-country ski trip into the snow-draped forests. Lowest and hottest spot in the U.S. If you've had it up to your hairline with ice storms and snow days, plan a getaway to the hottest, lowest place in the United States: Death Valley. It may sound like a depressing destination, but this place boasts some of the most adaptable plant and animal life on the planet. Death Valley is 86 meters (282 feet) below sea level and was formed when movement in the earth's crust along a fault line caused the land to sink. From Telescope Peak, the highest mountain in the national park at 11,049 feet, to the Badwater Basin floor is nearly a two-mile drop, twice the depth of the Grand Canyon. The average rainfall for the area is less than 2 inches per year. A record high of 134F (57C) was recorded in Death Valley on July 10, 1913. The park is open year-round, but guided ranger tours are available only in the cooler months from November to April, and they are a great way to learn more about the geology and history of this fascinating desert. Full Moon festivals, available in the cooler months of the year, give visitors the opportunity to see how this desolate landscape changes at night. After a long, hot day of exploring the desert, check into the elegant Inn at Furnace Creek, a well-appointed resort with spa amenities, spring-fed swimming pools, an 18-hole golf course and stone patios with sunset views. Most affordable Caribbean islands World's tallest mountain (measured from the ocean floor) If stargazing is your passion, you can't get much better than Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano in Hawaii that, when measured from the ocean floor, is taller than Mount Everest, the world's highest mountain by altitude. From its ocean-floor base, Mauna Kea measures more than 10,000 meters (about 33,000 feet) or a little more than six miles. Historically, the summit of Mauna Kea has been considered a spiritual place to native Hawaiians and only royalty and tribal chiefs were allowed to visit. Today, the summit is still spiritually relevant for many people, but thousands of visitors make the arduous trip each year to visit observatories perched at the summit. Every night, regardless of weather, the Visitor Information Station at the Onizuka Center for International Astronomy holds a free public stargazing program. Book a room at the Shipman House Bed and Breakfast and relax in the sunny, privately owned Victorian mansion, complete with more than 20 tropical fruit tree varieties blooming in the garden. Highest mountain in North America If the rugged, wild terrain of Alaska is what your wanderlusting heart needs, book a trip to Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska. This mammoth park -- roughly half the size of Rhode Island -- is home to the highest mountain (as measured from its base) in North America: Mount McKinley. The mountain is 6,194 meters (20,320 feet) high. At night, if you camp anytime from August through May, you might glimpse the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights. These vivid braids and streaks of light, sometimes red, sometimes green, can brighten the deep dark skies over Denali and take your breath away. Explore slabs of rocks that geologists have begun referring to as the dinosaur dance floors because of the high number of fossilized footprints they've discovered. There are no National Park Service accommodations in the park, but you can find stellar digs at Camp Denali and North Face Lodge, two privately owned full-service lodges that feature guided outings and flightseeing tours. Tallest natural bridge in the U.S. The amazing natural structure at Rainbow Bridge National Monument in Utah is estimated to be more than 200 million years old, and it stands 88 meters (290 feet) tall. Rainbow Bridge is considered to be the highest natural land bridge in the United States, and its name hints at the unique color striations formed from layers of different types of sandstone which became hardened and fused together by wild fluctuations in the climate through the Triassic and Jurassic periods. Geologists estimate that several million years ago heavy rains and a rising river gradient swept through the area, cutting wide swaths through the water-soluble sandstone and creating many interesting shapes in the landscape. Today, most visitors gawk at the bridge from a viewing platform, but some folks may backpack along the Navajo Mountain trail once they've acquired the appropriate permit from the Navajo Nation. Lake Powell, a reservoir of the Colorado River that straddles the border between Utah and Arizona, is relatively nearby and provides access by boat to the famous land bridge. One of the best ways to experience the spectacular landscape is to rent a houseboat and navigate Lake Powell via the more than 2,000 miles of shoreline. The sunniest place in the world If you're ready to trade in your parka and mittens for shorts and sunglasses, seek out a place where sunshine beams down 90 percent of the year. Yuma, Arizona, is the nation's sunniest city and the least humid place in the United States, according to the National Climatic Data Center. It's also the sunniest place in the world, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. Also, Yuma boasts the least number of days of precipitation in the nation: on average, 16 days per year. Several side trips outside of Yuma are worth taking. Bring your mountain bike and head out for an 11-mile trek in the Laguna Mountains area. Thirty miles north of Yuma is a must-see for history buffs: Castle Dome Landing is a ghost town and museum featuring 23 restored and recreated buildings, including a saloon and blacksmith. Northernmost point in the continental U.S. If the desert isn't calling your name, and ice fishing sounds alluring, head for an obscure little corner of Minnesota called Northwest Angle Inlet. The locals call the township "the Angle," and at 49.22 north latitude, it is the northernmost point in the contiguous United States. (Point Barrow, Alaska, is the northernmost point in all U.S. territory). The only way to get to "The Angle" is to drive through Canada or boat through Manitoba Bay. The Angle is a fisherman's paradise with plenty of walleye and bass, depending on the time of year you visit. Go on an ice fishing adventure with the Red Fox Ice Fishing Company and try out their heated fishing houses. They also rent private, lakefront cabins complete with a cast iron skillet perfect for frying up your catch. A nine-hole golf course offers a respite from fishing, and in the warmer months, berry picking is the activity of choice. By contrast, if you're hoping for warmer climes, try visiting the southernmost city in the continental United States: Key West, Florida. Its laid-back reputation and independent culture woos artists of all stripes, including authors Ernest Hemingway and Tennessee Williams, both of whom owned homes in the city. Deepest canyon in North America The Grand Canyon in Arizona may be immense, boasting nearly 277 river miles in length, but for sheer depth, Hells Canyon in eastern Oregon, eastern Washington and western Idaho wins hands-down. At its deepest, the canyon plunges 2,452 meters (8,043 feet) from the tip of He Devil Peak to the Snake River. The deepest part of the Grand Canyon is a mere 1,829 meters (6,000 feet). Hells Canyon was carved with the help of the Snake River which begins in western Wyoming, winds through the Snake River Plains, descends into the rocky Hells Canyon and eventually empties into the Columbia River. Make sure to view the Rush Creek Rapids from the majestic Hat Point lookout, the highest point of Hells Canyon on the Oregon side. Follow the Hells Canyon Scenic Byway, a 218-mile stretch of winding road that slips through much diverse landscape -- from the snow-tipped Wallowa Mountains to lush valleys. Book a night stay at the quiet, rustic Pine Valley Lodge in Halfway, Oregon. Longest river in the U.S. At more than 2,500 miles, the Missouri River is the longest in the United States, beginning in the Rocky Mountains of Montana, winding generally south and east before joining the mighty Mississippi River near St. Louis, Missouri. "Big Muddy" passes through seven states -- Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa, North and South Dakota, Montana and Wyoming -- and explorers Lewis and Clark nearly followed its entire length before realizing that the waterway stopped short of the Pacific Ocean. Three Forks, Montana, where the "Big Muddy" originates, is a city worthy of exploration. Start your stay at the Sacajawea Hotel, a recently renovated historic building, and get your waders ready because Three Forks is fly fishing country. Soak in the beauty of snowcapped mountains and cold, blue waters teeming with trout. Go canoeing in the headwaters and watch great blue herons fish near the banks. It's not uncommon to spot a moose lumbering along in the distance. Check out the intricate limestone caverns lined with beautiful stalactites and stalagmites at the Lewis and Clark Caverns State Park, just 17 miles from Three Forks. Tell us about the natural wonders in your state. Please share your picks in the comments section below.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/15/travel/natural-oddities/index.html	travel	Blood Falls and other natural oddities - CNN.com	2014/01/15	Wednesday Jan 15 08:17:44 EST 2014	(CNN) -- Earth never stops surprising us. Every corner of the planet offers some sort of natural peculiarity with an explanation that makes us wish we'd studied harder in junior high Earth science class. Some of these sites are challenging to get to; others are busy tourist destinations. They keep natural scientists searching for answers and the rest of us astounded by the secrets and mysteries the world continues to reveal. Blood Falls, Antarctica Most people won't see Blood Falls in person, but even in photographs, the sight is arresting: a blood-red waterfall staining the snow-white face of Taylor Glacier. The place was documented in 1911 by geographer/geologist Thomas Griffith Taylor, a member of Robert Falcon Scott's ill-fated expedition to the Antarctic. (Scott named the glacier for Taylor.) 8 very old sites in the New World Since then, glaciologists and microbiologists have sought to determine what causes the mysterious red flow. They've concluded that the source is a subterranean lake rich in the iron that gives the water its red hue. Stranger still, recent research has revealed microorganisms living 1,300 feet beneath the ice, sustained by the iron and sulfur in the water. Magnetic Hill, Moncton, New Brunswick What could possibly cause an automobile to roll backward uphill without power? A magnetic force from within the Earth? Something even more fantastic? Since the 1930s, when the phenomenon of Magnetic Hill was discovered (and almost immediately promoted as a tourist attraction), people have been trying to figure out its riddle. Even though it's been demonstrated that the "magnetic force" is an optical illusion and the uphill slope is actually a downhill slope, that hasn't stopped carloads of travelers from visiting Magnetic Hill and testing it for themselves. Digging deep: 15 ancient ruins you might not know Surtsey, Iceland When people try to convince you there's nothing new under the sun, direct them to the Icelandic island of Surtsey. Before 1963, it didn't exist. Then, an underwater volcano in the Westman Islands (Vestmannaeyjar) erupted, and when the activity settled down in 1967, what remained was an island where no island had been before. At its largest, Surtsey measured about 1 square mile, but wind and water have eroded the volcanic matter to a little more than half that size. Presented with this unsullied environment, the Icelandic government determined that the best thing to do was preserve it. Thus, although you can sail past it on a Westman Islands day cruise, Surtsey remains off-limits to just about everyone except marine biologists, geologists, botanists and other scientists conducting research there. 8 elegant U.S. mansion hotels Moeraki Boulders, New Zealand Large spherical boulders -- some measuring 12 feet in circumference -- are scattered on Koekohe Beach on the east coast of New Zealand's South Island. They formed millions of years ago on the ancient sea floor, collecting and hardening sediment and minerals around a core such as a fossil or a shell similar to the way oysters form pearls. They're not the world's only examples of what geologists call septarian concretions. You can also visit the Koutu Boulders near Hokianga Harbour on the northwestern coast of New Zealand's North Island, for example. Yet the Moeraki Boulders are some of the world's largest. The particulars of their origin and what caused the distinctive cracks inside them are still being studied. Midnight sun, Spitsbergen, Norway From April 20 to August 23, the sun never sets over Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago that lies north of Greenland in the Arctic Sea. The phenomenon plays havoc with everyone's body clocks. Is it noon? Is it midnight? After a day or two, it's hard to tell. Among the northernmost yet still-accessible places to experience the midnight sun is Spitsbergen, the largest island in the group. The island is well-suited and accommodating to travelers, who tend to keep strange hours in summer and who soon understand why their hotel rooms have been fitted with darkening curtains. Pamukkale, Turkey What appears to be a Doctor Zhivago-style snowy landscape in southwestern Turkey is actually the result of calcium carbonate deposits from 17 natural hot springs accumulating over thousands of years. Beginning in the late second century B.C., this area near present-day Denizli was a destination for those who sought the therapeutic benefits of the mineral-rich water whose temperature reaches upward of 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Today, you can see remnants of the baths at the ancient holy city of Hierapolis, but it's the stunning terraces, cliffs and petrified white waterfalls of Pamukkale -- Turkish for "Cotton Palace" -- that give it remarkable natural beauty. Racetrack Playa, Death Valley, California How ordinary stones manage to "sail" over the surface of Racetrack Playa in Death Valley National Park is a mystery people have tried to solve since 1915, when a prospector and his wife noticed tracks that seemed to indicate that the stones had somehow traveled across the dry earth. Short of cosmic intervention, the stones required terrestrial forces to move them. But what forces? The current prevailing theory about the "sailing stones" of Racetrack Playa, presented by a team of physicists in 2011, involves ice that forms around the stones, causing them to move and to leave a trail in their wake. Many visitors still hope for a more mystical explanation. Eternal Flame Falls, Orchard Park, New York Behind the cascade of a small waterfall in the Shale Creek Preserve section of Chestnut Ridge Park in suburban Buffalo, New York, you might see what appears to be an optical illusion: a flickering golden flame. Actually, you'll smell it before you see it, and amazingly, it's real, fueled by what geologists call a macroseep of natural gas from the Earth below. A geological fault in the shale allows about 1 kilogram of methane gas per day to escape to the surface, where, at some point, possibly the early 20th century, a visitor had the idea to set it alight. The water occasionally extinguishes the flame, but there's always another hiker with a lighter to reignite it. Old Faithful, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming Yellowstone National Park claims the highest concentration of geysers of any place on Earth. Geysers are hot springs with plumbing challenges that result in eruptions. More than 300 can be found throughout the park's 3,472 square miles, and none is more famous than Old Faithful. In fact, Old Faithful is the reason Yellowstone was designated a National Park -- the first in the United States -- in 1872. Its name comes from the perceived regularity of its eruptions, which occur every 55 to 120 minutes and last for two to five minutes. The spectacular eruptions remain a source of fascination for the more than 3.5 million people who visit Yellowstone each year. The fact that the eruptions aren't quite as regular as they might seem -- and that the mean eruption interval seems to be lengthening -- keeps geologists fascinated, too. Relampago de Catatumbo, Ologa, Venezuela Thanks to its humidity, its elevation and the clash of winds from the mountains and the sea, the southwestern corner of Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela has the world's highest frequency of lightning activity (250 flashes per square kilometer per year). More than 200 nights per year, with peaks in May and October, lightning flashes fill the sky -- sometimes 25 or more flashes per minute. To put that in perspective: The National Weather Service classifies anything over 12 strikes per minute as "excessive." Named for the Catatumbo River, which flows from Colombia in to Lake Maracaibo, the Relampago de Catatumbo, or Catatumbo Lighting, has become a highlight for travelers who spend their nights wide awake and wide-eyed watching the spectacle.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/14/travel/irpt-glorious-ireland/index.html	travel	27 photos of glorious Ireland - CNN.com	2014/03/14	Friday Mar 14 08:22:41 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Kevin Kane's love affair with Ireland began in 2000, when he and his then-fiancee piggybacked on a trip with his brothers and their wives. The 39-year-old financial adviser from Havertown, Pennsylvania, has been back six times since, taking his now wife, brothers and mother on various trips that spanned nearly every county in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Ahead of St. Patrick's Day, Kane and other CNN readers shared their best memories and photos from mesmerizing visits to the Emerald Isle. The green and rugged Dingle Peninsula, in the southwest of Ireland, is Kane's favorite destination, he wrote, though "the Glens of Antrim are spectacular in November, the Ring of Kerry cannot be described adequately by James Joyce himself on a clear day in June, and the vibrancy of Galway and Westport are enough to recharge the soul as you wander joyfully from Tobercurry to Ennis." Kane offered a few tips for the first-time visitor: Don't be overly ambitious on your first trip. "Pick a few towns to stay in and do several days in each. One-hundred miles between towns is not a two-hour drive as you might expect. If there are no major motorways, it could easily become a harrowing four-hour trip for the novice European driver." Talk to the locals in pubs. "Ask questions, don't fake a brogue, and listen to the suggestions they are sure to make about what to see in that immediate area. The Irish are fiercely parochial and love to show off their town's hidden secrets to tourists." Do something off the beaten path. "Take a ferry out to an island to walk around a bit, find an Abbey ruin in a field to explore, take a flask of Jameson and hike up a mountain. Get lost in what Ireland is, and has to offer." In summary, Kane said: "Keep your itinerary reasonable, soak up every minute you are there, and make notes for your next trip, for you will surely be returning. It's that kind of place." 29 beach photos that will make you drool 11 ways to make the most of Hawaii What are your Ireland travel tips?

Yes, it's a pipe dream for 99% of us, but let's imagine. Put that bank balance out of your mind. Now conjure up a snorkel and flippers. To find some of the most out-of-this-world destinations for jet-setters in 2013, CNN.com asked Robb Report editorial director Bruce Wallin for ideas. So keep this list handy in case of a fat financial windfall: Singita Grumeti Reserves, Tanzania  Located on a private 350,000-acre game reserve, the Singita Grumeti Reserves has only four small lodges on the property. The four-bedroom Serengeti House, which is listed on its blog, quietly opened to guests in December and includes its own chef, guides, tennis court and pool. "The lodges themselves are as nice as Four Seasons New York, if not nicer," says Wallin. "The wildlife is great, and the service and food is incredible. It's one of the nicest places in the world to stay." Serengeti House rates start at $8,500 a night for up to four guests during high season (parts of December and January and all of June, July and August), with additional charges for five to eight guests. Pay $84,500 to rent the house for a week for up to eight guests. Song Saa Private Island, Cambodia The dream of an Australian couple living in Cambodia, the exclusive Song Saa Private Island resort opened in March. With just 27 villas on two small islands in the Koh Rong archipelago, the resort offers diving, snorkeling, nature trails, kayaking, fishing and boat trips to surrounding islands. Song Saa also has a relationship with the Amansara resort in Siem Reap, allowing travelers to stay there while visiting Angkor Wat's ancient temples. High-season villa prices starts at $1,595 a night for the one-bedroom Jungle Villa. Rates include food, beverages including beer and house wines and spirits, guided tours and the use of kayaks, boats and snorkeling gear. Four Seasons Around the World Imagine jetting around the world via private 757 airplane, visiting some of the world's most extraordinary sites with travel experts and staying at Four Seasons hotels at your destinations. Customs is a breeze for such world travelers. Four Seasons featured two around-the-world trips in 2012, each 22 days long, and is already taking reservations for next September's trip. The 2013 journey includes stops in Japan, China, the Maldives, Turkey and Russia. Only 76 spots are available. Double occupancy costs $70,950 a person, and the single supplement is an extra $8,650. Musha Cay and the Islands of Copperfield Bay, Bahamas Want a vacation for up to 24 family members or best friends that goes beyond luxury? Consider Musha Cay and the Islands of Copperfield Bay, owned and developed into a beach resort in the Exumas by world-famous magician David Copperfield. You and your guests can take part in a treasure hunt, spy challenge or other theatrical adventures designed by the team behind Copperfield's magic shows. Of course, the resort also has beaches, a swimming pool, tennis court, outdoor movie theater and nature trails. Rent out the whole resort, which consists of five houses on the main island. Rates start at $37,500 a night for up to 12 guests with a four-night minimum, including all meals and beverages. The resort can host up to 24 guests for an additional fee. King Pacific Lodge, Northern British Columbia, Canada Accessible via privately chartered plane from Vancouver to Bella Bella with a transfer to float planes for the final leg, King Pacific Lodge is in the middle of British Columbia's Great Bear Rainforest. The lodge actually floats: Built from cedar, fir, pine and stone on a barge, King Pacific is only open June through September. It has 17 guest rooms and suites, a spa, deck and pool. Prices start at $4,900 (Canadian) based on double occupancy for three nights and include all meals, beverages and use of the lodge facilities. The Great Bear Rainforest, home to the Gitga'at people (part of the Tsimshian Nation), is host to many nature activities, including kayaking, fishing, whale watching and wildlife watching. Dorado Beach, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve, Puerto Rico The Dorado Beach, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve, isn't a newcomer to Puerto Rico. The resort, which opened is doors on December 12, is on the site of Laurance Rockefeller's former estate near San Juan. The property continued his environmental legacy by setting aside some 75% of its 1,400 acres as green space. All 100 guestrooms and 14 one-bedroom suites are on the beach. "Su Casa," a restored four-bedroom beachfront villa, was the original hacienda. Restaurant and beachfront dining feature the talents of acclaimed chef Jose Andres. The spa offers a tree-house option for massages. Rates start at $1,499 a night based on double occupancy. Ballyfin, Ireland Sitting at the foot of the Slieve Bloom Mountains in the Irish countryside, Ballyfin was named in the Robb Report's "Best of the Best 2012." Originally the home of Sir Charles Coote, the Regency mansion reopened as Ballyfin in May 2011 with 15 guest rooms. Built in 1822 for Coote's family, the 614-acre estate was later sold and served as a Catholic school. Purchased by a Chicago businessman in 2002, it underwent a nine-year renovation that upgraded the technology while keeping the Old World elegance and charm. The resort is closed in January and February (reservations can still be made during that time), and it reopens for the season on March 8. Daily weekend rates for March and April, including meals and amenities, start at 915 euros ($1,206 U.S.) a night for a deluxe room, based on double occupancy. Aspen, Colorado  The recent reopening of the Hotel Jerome, one of the oldest U.S. luxury hotels west of the Mississippi, is just one of the reasons why Aspen is a top U.S. spot for high-end travel, says Wallin. Even without the renovation, Aspen was already a magnet for the rich and famous. St. Regis Aspen reopened in December 2011 after a $40 million redesign. And the five-star lodge Little Nell just opened Element 47, which Wallin says may be the best restaurant in town. "Aspen has long been the country's most glamorous ski destination, so it's hard to say it's undergoing a revival -- it never really waned in popularity in the first place," says Wallin, "But with all the new restaurants, renewed hotels and other developments in the area, Aspen is probably the best it's ever been as a luxury destination. " At the St. Regis Aspen, the winter season starting rate for a standard guest room, based on double occupancy, is $899 a night. Hotel Jerome's winter season rates start at $695 a night based on double occupancy.

Antarctica is far from your only option. From the windswept beaches of Tierra del Fuego at South America's tip to sunny Cape Town, South Africa, and Melbourne, Australia, penguin colonies exist in many strikingly beautiful destinations in the Southern Hemisphere. There's no denying it: Penguins are among the most charismatic creatures. Their notorious curiosity, waddling gait and comical body language seldom fail to charm. But these flightless sea birds have evolved over 15 million years to become strong, nimble swimmers that often migrate long distances in pursuit of fish following seasonal ocean currents. 7 prime spots for wildlife viewing Today, most of the 18 species of penguins are in decline because of climate change, habitat destruction, pollution and overfishing -- in fact, more than half are considered endangered. You can support their survival by visiting carefully managed colonies where tour operators respect penguin habitat and educate visitors about conservation efforts. November through March -- when it's the warmest in the Southern Hemisphere -- is prime time for viewing many penguin species. During the warm season, they spend more time on shore to breed, nest and raise their young. Check out these amazing penguin spots: Tierra del Fuego (Argentina and Chile) Ushuaia, Argentina, the southernmost city in the world, boasts several tour operators offering day cruises to view penguins and other marine life. But only one, PiraTour, gives visitors the chance to walk among the penguins. PiraTour runs two six-hour tours daily from the port of Ushuaia. Tours are limited to 20 people, so be sure to make reservations well in advance. A 90-minute minivan ride takes visitors through Patagonian forests and along secluded pebbly coves before arriving at Estancia Harberton, a charming family-owned farm and marine center. From there, visitors transfer to a boat for a short ride to Isla Martillo, a research station that monitors the 3,000 pairs of Magellanic penguins and a small colony of gentoo penguins that nest here between September and April. Visitors will spend up to an hour observing the very vocal Magellanic penguins, which bellow and strut along the beach by the hundreds. The tour guide will instruct you to maintain a safe distance from the birds, but be prepared for them to approach you as penguins can be extremely curious. After a few minutes on the beach, you'll be led up a bluff to see their nesting ground, where the birds often return to the same mate and same nest year after year. Back at Estancia Harberton, you'll have time to grab a hot drink at the tea room or explore the farm's on-site marine research center. There is also a guest house and camp sites; contact Harberton directly if you want to extend your visit to this peaceful haven. Otherwise, Ushuaia offers a wide range of accommodation options, from backpacker hostels to luxury hotels perched on glacial mountainsides overlooking the city. PiraTour, U.S. $95 for a six-hour tour (50% discount for children under 12), plus $13 entry fee to Estancia Harberton  Phillip Island, Australia Since the 1920s, tourists have flocked to Phillip Island to witness the smallest penguin species, known as little penguins or fairy penguins, return to shore each evening to feed their young after a long day of fishing. Only 12 inches tall and weighing less than 3 pounds, the little penguin is found only in Australia and New Zealand. For decades, the penguins on Phillip Island were largely unprotected from the throngs of sightseers, but today most visitors observe the evening penguin "parade" from elevated boardwalks and viewing platforms to minimize disturbances to the birds. For those who want a more up-close-and-personal experience, a limited number of tickets are available each day for small group, ranger-guided tours where you can walk among penguins on a secluded beach. The ticket price helps support conservation work on the island, including habitat restoration and research focusing on how penguins are affected by climate change, development and invasive species. Phillip Island is a 90-minute drive from Melbourne, but plan on spending at least a couple of days here to enjoy all its wildlife, including koalas, wallabies, elusive anteaters, seals and whales. Phillip Island Nature Park, prices start at U.S. $23 for evening viewing from a platform, $46 for close-up viewing and $82.50 for a private, ranger-guided ecoadventure in a part of the penguin colony that's closed to the general public. Cape Town, South Africa The southern tip of Africa offers numerous opportunities to view the African penguin, previously known as the jackass penguin because of its distinctive donkey-like bray. African penguins have declined by 80% in the past 50 years because of pollution, development, climate change and irresponsible tourism activities. The Boulders Beach colony, about 24 miles from Cape Town, was only established in 1983, but it's now an important habitat for the endangered bird. As its name suggests, the beach is strewn with granite boulders, which create an impressive backdrop for photographing the penguins. Today, boardwalk viewing areas help protect the birds from excessive human contact, although you may encounter penguins while swimming and should take care not to approach them if possible. A ride on the wild side in Tanzania Boulders Beach is part of Table Mountain National Park, situated at the convergence of the Atlantic and Indian oceans on the Cape of Good Hope. Hiking, mountain biking, wind sailing and wildlife viewing are just a few of the activities here that offer impressive views of Cape Town and the surrounding countryside. The nearby village of Simon's Town, with its historic cottages and cobblestone streets, provides numerous accommodation and dining options. Table Mountain National Park, visitors to the park pay a daily conservation fee of U.S. $5.30 per adult and $2.50 per child. Otago Peninsula, New Zealand Even in a country known for its dramatic scenery and amazing wildlife, the Otago Peninsula stands out. Located on New Zealand's South Island, the peninsula was born of volcanic eruptions that created steep mountains and rugged sea cliffs. It's a hot spot for marine wildlife viewing -- seals, sea lions, elephant seals and, of course, penguins. Here it's possible to see both the little penguin and the rare yellow-eyed penguin. A number of tour operators on the peninsula are committed to environmental education and sustainable ecotourism. Nature Guides Otago offers naturalist-led tours as well as lodging that emphasize sustainability and support penguin habitat restoration and conservation. Another option is Penguin Place, a conservation reserve on a private farm. Visitors begin the tour by learning about penguin conservation efforts before proceeding to a series of trenches and observation huts. From these vantage points, they are treated to up-close views of a yellow-eyed penguin colony while minimizing disturbances to the birds, which live in coastal forests and have suffered significant habitat loss from logging. Nature Guides Otago, a sunrise tour of a yellow-eyed penguin colony, maximum six people, runs U.S. $75 per person. Nature packages, which include two nights at a B&B cottage, sunrise penguin tour and a daylong tour of the Otago Peninsula, run $540 per person. Note that tour priority is given to those staying at the cottage. Penguin Place, penguin tours run throughout the day. Price is U.S. $41 for adults and $10 for children. Budget accommodations are available at the Penguin Place Lodge for U.S. $22 adults, $8.50 children Galapagos Islands, Ecuador  It comes as a surprise to most travelers that a trip to the Galapagos could include the chance to see penguins. But in fact, the islands are home to the only penguin that lives in a tropical climate. Unlike other species that migrate according to the season, endangered Galapagos penguins live here year-round, especially in the colder waters of the western islands such as Isla Isabela. Almost any tour of the Galapagos includes the chance to see an incredible variety of wildlife, but some operators specifically offer penguin tours. More likely than not you'll be observing the birds from a boat, but if the tour includes snorkeling in an area frequented by penguins, there's a chance that you could end up swimming with the birds. Southern Exploration, a member of the International Ecotourism Society, is one tour operator that offers the chance to see penguins at close range. However, since the Galapagos National Park Service restricts tourists to specific areas and may limit access depending on conditions, it's best to contact tour operators directly to confirm that you'll be able to see penguins on your trip. Talk through the options carefully with the booking agent to make sure your expectations will be met. Southern Explorations, four to 15-day Galapagos cruising tours with an English-speaking guide, start at around U.S. $3,000 up to about $6,000, including the flight from Quito to the Galapagos. Ask to speak to a Galapagos expert and tell them you are interested in seeing penguins so they can find an appropriate tour during your travel dates. Avoid holiday travel unless you book a year or more in advance -- tours around Christmas and Easter fill up fast.

Every autumn, he would see an influx of tourists flood his state to get a glimpse of the brilliant fall leaves. He didn't get what the big deal was. "Why do people come to look at the trees?" he wondered. But as he got older, he developed an interest in photography. And that made him stop taking the vibrant autumn color for granted. Great leaf-peeping experiences "I suddenly began to notice the stunning colors that seemed to blanket the hills in fire each fall as the days got shorter and the nights became colder," he remembers. "Slowly but surely, as I gained experience and insight, I began to really understand what a special place Vermont is, and I began to fall in love with my home and the stunning colors." Collier is now a staff photographer for the Barre-Montpelier Times Argus. This year, he decided for the first time to document the fall beauty of his state. He shared his images alongside dozens of other photographers on CNN iReport. The best of his shots, along with other images of autumn around the world, are in the gallery above.

Don't laugh gallery snobs and car-haters: The automobile has vaulted from the streets to the lofty art world. Even if automobiles aren't your thing, the Firebird's bizarre wings and bubble cockpit are worth a peek. It's among 17 "concept cars" on exhibit at Atlanta, Georgia's High Museum of Art. Many of these are one-of-a-kind. When you first walk into the exhibit, it's clear these cars aren't designed for mere mortals. Every car has a price, and these are worth millions. But in reality, the unique nature of this collection makes them priceless in a growing market. Collectible car sales last year in the U.S. topped $1 billion. Money aside, this exhibit really exemplifies America's long and fiery hot love affair with cars. These rolling masterpieces were never intended to be mass produced. They were meant to be romanced, idolized, even worshipped. Concept cars are marketing tools designed to trigger buzz and spur sales. You can be sure the Da Vinci of General Motors -- legendary designer Harley Earl -- put just as much imagination into his jet-plane-looking Firebird as old Leonardo did with that smirking Mona. "These have got to be some of the world's craziest, beautiful cars," a visitor says to me with a grin as big as the grill-work on a stunning '51 GM LeSabre XP-8 sitting a few feet away. Beautiful, yes. Crazy? VERY. A few examples: -- Not a clown car: The 1970 Lancia Stratos HF Zero measures only 33 inches from its rooftop to the floor. -- Electric Egg: A tiny electric-powered, plastic, bubble-on-wheels was created in Nazi-occupied Paris in 1942. -- Fabric exterior: A 2001 BMW Gina wrinkles when you open its doors. See photos of these sweet cars Parked against a wall in another exhibit room sits a green replica 1935 Bugatti Type 57S. Steampunk fans will dig this elegant machine. It looks like something out of Disney's "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea." "You can fetishize just about any detail on the Bugatti you like, from the grill to every bolt," a man standing nearby says to me. This guy gets it! We're like kids in a candy store -- but nobody's letting us have any candy. Instead we're hypnotized by the cars and their dramatic, sweeping lines and their chrome-spangled cockpits. Related: Gorgeous art cars auctioned Days of future past These vehicles were designed to look like the future. Take for example the '59 Cadillac Cyclone XP-74. It stops you cold. The thing looks like a silver rocket from a 1950s B movie. And it has futuristic safety features too. A radar-based anti-collision system is tucked inside the Caddy's cone-shaped so-called "dagmar" headlights. Two of the exhibit's creators -- Ken Gross and Sarah Schleuning -- showed me around a little. "In the past, the future was really cool," joked Gross, who's also been Playboy Magazine's car writer for more than 25 years. Gross, the exhibit's consulting curator, says these vehicles were imagined and built by designers with one goal: to get attention. Harley Earl's been dead for 45 years and and he's still turning heads. That's called being way ahead of your time. As Gross puts it: "Car designers are the rock stars of the automobile industry and they always have been." When it came to car design, Earl pushed the industry to put style as a top priority, says Schleuning, the museum's curator of decorative arts and design. "It wasn't just about the cars' technological marvels, but also about their aesthetic appeal." Related: Teeny cars worth big bucks The rolling rocket The rule breaker -- the bad boy of this bunch -- Gross says, is the Firebird. This rolling rocket gets its own chamber in the exhibit. And it's no wonder. -- It's the first two-section gas turbine powered car to be built and tested in the U.S. -- It's one of the first cars with four-wheel disc brakes. -- Its body is made mostly of expensive and super strong titanium.  In 1954 GM toted the Firebird around the country as part of a traveling car show called the Motorama. The car "was so fast they only had one or two engineers who drove it at the proving grounds," Gross says. "They used Mauri Rose, who was an Indy 500 winner, to test it -- and even he never took it to its full potential." It's been suggested that America's century-long obsession with driving may die with the aging Baby Boomer generation. Some experts say that Millennials now in their 20s and 30s have little interest in owning cars, although sales among that group shot up in 2012. Are we falling out of love with our cars? The Atlanta museum is by no means the first to celebrate automobile design. Back in 1951, New York's Museum of Modern Art opened an exhibit featuring eight cars described as elegant and exotic. More recently, Gross says, the idea has become a national trend, taking hold in places like Nashville, Tennessee, and Raleigh, North Carolina. Maybe increased interest within America's art community will stoke the fire, and keep the romance burning a little longer.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/21/travel/survivor-jeff-probst-favorite-travel/index.html	travel	'Survivor' top 10: Jeff Probst's favorite travel spots - CNN.com	2014/05/21	Wednesday May 21 08:13:30 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Jeff Probst was a bit of a travel late bloomer, but the "Survivor" host has more than made up for lost time. Born and raised in Wichita, Kansas, "I was never a foreign exchange student and didn't even have a passport until 'Survivor,' " says Probst, 52. The show has been "a life-changing experience." Since the competitive reality series debuted on CBS in 2000, the Emmy-winning host and executive producer hasn't stopped traveling all over the world. "I've been underwater at 60 feet with a shark and found myself sitting out in an Africa game reserve with zebras running past me," says Probst. "I really began to understand simultaneously how unique I am and how I'm one grain of sand in this giant beach we live on. It really did help shape me." The 28th "Survivor" season finale airs live on Wednesday, May 21. The cast and crew work hard, shooting two seasons of the CBS series over 78 days of the 95 days they're on location. Anytime there's a break, "we play hard," says Probst. And where they get to play is pretty spectacular. Probst shared his top 10 favorite spots in the world with CNN, some of which are places the show took him. Others may surprise you. 1. Palau  Anytime he had a break during shooting "Survivor" seasons 10 and 16 on Palau, an island nation in the western Pacific Ocean, Probst headed to the water to scuba dive. "Of all the places we traveled, if you're into ocean and scuba diving or just snorkeling, it's one of the greatest spots in the world," he says. Blue Corner, a popular (and advanced) diving spot where you can descend at least 20 feet and clip onto a rock, is a favorite dive. "You don't go anywhere," he says. "The entire sea world goes past you, and it's the most amazing aquarium in the world." Another favorite spot is Jellyfish Lake, the home of hundreds of thousands of jellyfish that have lost the need to sting because they don't have to fight predators. "You're swimming with these jellyfish, and it's like being on a psychedelic trip," he says. 2. Kenya Stargazing and waking up to wildlife outside his tent at the Shaba National Reserve in Kenya were two of Probst's favorite memories of season three. "You've never seen stars like you see in Africa," he says. "There's no ambient light ... when you really see what's up there, it's mind-blowing." He'd head back into his tent to sleep. Come morning, he would open his tent zipper one click at a time. "You didn't want to scare off the wildlife that you hoped was waiting outside your tent. It was not uncommon to find zebra and giraffes." "A lion chased a zebra through our protective fence into camp and killed the zebra, and two other lions came to help with the kill," he says. 3. Cook Islands  Looking for a remote desert island? "Survivor" location scouts found a perfect spot in the Cook Islands in the South Pacific for season 13. The Polynesian culture of the islands celebrates the sea and offers a relaxed way of life. Known especially for coral reef lagoons, kayaking and beaches, the islands also offered Probst and the crew a chance to know the locals. "The majority of our crew lived with local families. You could eat (at work) or you could eat with them." Probst picked up a bit of the relaxed local attitude. "You can't help but be impacted by a different lifestyle. You do realize there are lots of ways to live." World's best new skyscraper is ... 4. Kona, Hawaii  Formerly a retreat for Hawaiian royalty, Kona is now the Probst family's vacation spot during spring break. That's because Probst married Lisa Russell, who had two children from a previous marriage, in 2011. They all often head to Kona when the children, Michael, 10, and Ava, 7, are on spring break. "There's something about Kona," he says. "I feel so at home and grounded and connected to the earth (there). I love the weather and the water. It's so peaceful. Lisa and I have talked about if we ever lived somewhere else, this would be the place." 5. Amazon, Brazil Every season in the Amazon, it rains so much that the water levels rise and drop by 40 feet in a matter of weeks, says Probst. The season six crew stayed at the Ariau Amazon Towers, a hotel built on stilts. When they arrived, there was no water around the hotel. During the shoot, it rained so much they ended up surrounded by water, by design. Probst says the Amazon is the spookiest place he has been, and not just because of his childhood fear of crocodiles. "There are more insects and snakes and weird animals--I didn't know what they werethan I've ever seen before. And there are piranha in the water." And those crocodiles? Traveling to the Tribal Council -- the ceremony where players are eliminated -- required traveling down a river in a skinny, motor-equipped canoe. "We would take these canoes, and I'd shine a flashlight on the shore and see pairs of red (crocodile) eyes dotting it," he says. "I'd be almost petrified the canoe would tip over." Don't worry about him, though. "I like being out of my comfort zone," he says. "I don't know that I would ever visit again, but it's on the kids' bucket list." That means he'll probably be back. 6. Australian outback  "Survivor" season two took the cast and crew into the outback, where Probst often woke to a family of kangaroos outside his tent. "We think of them as friendly, but know they are lethal and massive," he says. "One could literally kill me with one kick to my head while yawning." Absorbing a bit of Australian culture, Probst also returned home to Los Angeles worrying less about everything. "Australians have a different way of living: 'No worries' comes from a place of truth. They don't worry nearly as much about things as we do." "It's had the greatest impact on my life, how I raise my kids and how the show works," he says. "Anyone who has hung out in Australia knows what I mean. Of course I care and am competitive, but I am also going to do it while tossing back a beer." Weirdest rock formations around the United States 7. Vail, Colorado Growing up in Kansas, Probst's family piled into the family station wagon for an annual ski vacation in Vail, Colorado. There's something about the Rockies that's completely familiar to him, down to the expressions on his parents' faces as they waited in line to rent skis. "Our parents did that trip every year, and I can remember my dad telling me years later that family adventures and vacations are a lot of work ... but they are never not worth it," Probst says. "I can remember all the times we loaded up in our station wagon to drive through the snow-covered mountains so we could have family vacations." 8. El Toro Bay, Samoa When Probst performed his parents' vow renewal ceremony for their 50th anniversary in Samoa in 2009, he had no idea he'd be returning for a similarly important event two years later. That's when he flew Lisa and her children to Samoa, where he was shooting season 19. When they arrived at El Toro Bay, he took Michael and Ava aside to let them know he was asking their mother to marry him and to ask for their help. The children quickly changed clothes and helped to lead her to Probst, who proposed. They married four months later. 9. Venice, California While Probst spends a good amount of time traveling, he also very much appreciates what's available in his own backyard of Los Angeles, especially the beaches. "There's such a fun vibe on the (Venice) boardwalk with some great people-watching," he says. "All kinds of people show up: businessmen, surfers, moms, kids, all creating a crazy rhythm. The rings in Venice are a great little escape ... I just chalk up and swing away." 10. Around the world  You'd think Probst and his family would be tired of him traveling when he gets home from shooting halfway around the world. You'd be wrong. Standing in front of the 10-foot by 6-foot map in their hallway, with pushpins marking where everyone has been, the family keeps talking about taking a month to go around the world. Where would they stop? For sure, Rome, London and Switzerland. The rest of the trip is still up in the air. While he knows there's plenty he hasn't yet explored at home, "the other view is we have just one shot, and let's say by plane, by train, by bus, by car, by scooter, by skateboard, we're going to experience the world," he says. "Do we learn something we want to bring back home? Or did we find we are perfectly happy with the way things are?" Where do you think Jeff Probst and the cast and crew of "Survivor" should go next season? Share your thoughts in the comments below.   
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/14/travel/best-water-slides/index.html	travel	World's scariest, best water slides - CNN.com	2014/05/14	Wednesday May 14 11:16:18 EDT 2014

 (CNN) -- Verrckt will become the world's tallest water slide -- it's taller than both the Statue of Liberty and Niagara Falls -- when it opens in May in Kansas. Until then, here are some of the world's best water slides and features that make each one unique. Verruckt, Schlitterbahn Waterpark (Kansas) Although the team behind Verrckt refuse to confirm its exact measurements, they've promised that it'll be the world's tallest when it opens later this month. The ride will feature a steep downhill section followed by an uphill section. Riders will sit in four-person rafts. "Verruckt is the brainchild of Jeff Henry, the water park innovator who invented uphill water coasters and inland surfing," says Winter Prosapio of Schlitterbahn Waterpark. "What sets Verruckt apart is not just the height, but the technology needed to make it work. "The uphill portion required a new nozzle-based technology that can sense the weight of each raft and adjusts the water blast to send riders over the hill." That means overdoing it on the hot dogs and cotton candy won't be a problem for the ride. For your stomach, it might be a different story. Schlitterbahn Waterpark, 9400 State Ave., Kansas City, Kansas; +1 913 312 3110 MORE: 12 of the world's best water parks Mammoth, Holiday World & Splashin' Safari (Indiana) Mammoth is both the world's longest water coaster and the world's first six-person water coaster. It covers over three acres of the Splashin' Safari park and has a length of just less than a third of a mile. "It's powered with LIMs (linear induction motors), which is the same technology used for roller coasters and light rail transportation," explains Ruth McMahon, director at ProSlide Technology Inc. "These specially adapted LIMs are responsible for the Mammoth's incredibly fast and steep uphill and downhill sections." Holiday World & Splashin' Safari, 452 E. Christmas Blvd., Santa Claus, Indiana; +1 812 937 4401 Aqualoop, Ixtapan Parque Acuatico (Mexico) The Aqualoop is one of the few water slides to feature an almost-vertical loop-the-loop. Riders start by standing on a trapdoor. The drop that follows allows them to gain enough speed -- up to 60 kilometers an hour -- to make it around the loop. "With the unique slide path, we had to optimize the shape of the loop to maximize the range of riders that could use it while making sure no one got stuck," says Bruce Bradley, senior engineering specialist at Whitewater theme park designers. Considering the transparency of the slide, that could certainly prove to be embarrassing. The park is located about 90 minutes by highway (106 kilometers) southwest of Mexico City.

"By strategically adding flat panels to three sides of the funnel, the passengers in the rafts rise higher up the side walls -- 25% more than they would otherwise -- making the Abyss more thrilling than the standard cone-shape slides," explains Tat Won, senior landscape architect at Whitewater, the company that designed the slide. The park is located in Fushun in Liaoning Province, about 665 kilometers northeast of Beijing. Bali Water Park, Re-gao Amusement Park, Fushun, Liaoning Province, China Aquaconda, Aquaventure Waterpark (Dubai, United Arab Emirates) The Aquaconda is the world's first slide-within-a-slide, comprising an enclosed tube slide that weaves in and out of the framework of a flume-style ride. It's made from translucent plastic, so passengers on one section can watch those whizzing down the other. "Before translucent technology, enclosed water slides were dark, almost industrial looking," says Geoff Chutter, chief executive of Whitewater.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/02/travel/cities-of-destruction/index.html	travel	7 fascinating cities of destruction - CNN.com	2014/05/02	Friday May 2 08:24:22 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- The world tends to celebrate the ingenuity and strength of great civilizations that have flourished by successfully subduing nature. But every bit as fascinating are the stories of once-great civilizations forced to submit to nature's capricious power. Here are seven ancient cities -- almost all UNESCO World Heritage sites -- that tell of triumph and failure in the face of dramatic conditions. Perhaps they also offer a cautionary tale for the modern world: No matter how advanced the civilization, we are often no match for nature. World Photo award winners are ... Pompeii, Italy Sixteen years before Mount Vesuvius enveloped Pompeii in a deadly shroud of ash and noxious gas, a powerful earthquake shook the Roman city, destroying buildings and killing hundreds. But the industrious people of Pompeii quickly set about repairing the damage, restoring their beautiful city to its former splendor. Little did they imagine that something far more destructive was in store. Then, on the morning of August 24, A.D. 79, Vesuvius exploded spectacularly, sending successive, choking waves of thick ash, hot rock and volcanic gas over the town throughout the day and night. Those who did not flee in time were suffocated, baked and buried in ash several feet thick. Today, the ancient city of Pompeii offers a detailed picture of life in a prosperous Roman town 2,000 years ago. Visitors can see a fascinating array of artifacts: intact rooms and furnishings, finely wrought bronze statues and haunting, well-preserved paintings and mosaics depicting people so full of vitality that one can't help but feel an affinity for those whose lives ended in such agony. Detailed plaster casts of victims can still be viewed, an eerie reminder of those lives cut short. Alas, ancient Pompeii is threatened again -- this time by an excess of visitors and a succession of floods in recent years that have done extensive damage to some of its most famous sites, some of which have now been closed to the public. For further inspiration in planning your visit, you might go see "Pompeii," a new 3-D movie depicting the city's final hours. www.pompeiturismo.it. 15 ancient ruins you might not know Tiwanaku, Bolivia More than 12,500 feet in the Bolivian Andes near the shore of Lake Titicaca, this mysterious, pre-Incan city was once the religious and political center of the Tiwanaku culture, which ruled a vast Andean empire. Archaeologists generally place its origins around 1200 B.C., but some believe the city could be far older. Whatever the case, the Tiwanaku (also spelled Tiahuanaco) people were flourishing between A.D. 400 and A.D. 900. They left evidence of a society with impressive technological skill and a highly developed cosmology. Lacking beasts of burden, the people of Tiwanaku nonetheless managed to haul huge stone slabs, some weighing several dozen tons, for miles to construct religious temples and the towering monolithic statues that guard over them. The structures are built to astrological specifications to track the progress of the sun and mark seasonal shifts -- very important for an empire built on agriculture. Today, it's hard to imagine that this arid, treeless land could produce a bounty of potato, quinoa, corn and even peaches. The citizenry's collective effort to cultivate this land allowed it to flourish, and they reaped the rewards. The empire of Tiwanaku eventually expanded to include most of Bolivia, as well as territory in present-day Peru, Chile and Argentina. But during the 12th century A.D., the empire collapsed. The prevailing theory today is that climate change caused crops to fail, eventually destabilizing the government. One of the most iconic sights at Tiwanaku is the Puerta del Sol, an imposing rectangular portal wrought from a single 45-ton stone slab that stands atop the Kalasasaya Temple. It is carved with symbols representing a powerful god, as well as elements of an astrological calendar. The pyramid of Akapana is another must-see, along with the red sandstone pillars with carved heads, possibly representing the practice of publicly displaying severed enemy heads. Tour companies operating out of La Paz can get you to Tiwanaku in less than an hour. You can also visit the Regional Museum of Tiwanaku Culture to view collections of stone and ceramic artifacts. www.bolivia.travel. 8 very old sites in the New World Skara Brae, Scotland Older than the Egyptian pyramids and Stonehenge, Skara Brae is a 5,000-year-old farming village along the white sand dunes of the Bay of Skaill, on the largest of the Orkney Islands. The best-preserved Neolithic village in Northern Europe was discovered in 1850 after a powerful storm roared through this archipelago north of the Scottish mainland. The houses are set into large mounds made of midden, or household waste. Part of the reason so many details of the village are known today is that the furnishings, like the dwellings themselves, were often made of stone. Many of Skara Brae's archaeological contemporaries are not nearly as well-preserved because their structures were made from wood. Not so here on a windswept island, where wood was hard to come by. After thousands of years of habitation, research suggests that climate change, perhaps responsible for brutal sandstorms, might have led the villagers to abandon the settlement around 2,500 years ago. www.historic-scotland.gov.uk. Mesa Verde, Colorado In the stillness of a summer evening in Mesa Verde National Park, it is fascinating to contemplate the network of villages that once stretched across the Colorado Plateau. For 700 years, starting around A.D. 600, the Ancestral Puebloan people, also referred to as the Anasazi, lived atop tree-dotted mesas and in elaborate, multistory buildings constructed into the sides of sheltering sandstone cliffs. More than 4,000 archaeological sites have been discovered here, and new discoveries occur regularly. Sometimes exceeding 8,000 feet, this was a harsh environment in which to build a civilization. People had to survive hot summers and freezing winters. The Pueblo people hunted and farmed corns, beans and squash and developed innovative ways to store water, including reservoirs and dams. But by A.D. 1300, it appears that their advances in irrigation and agriculture were insufficient in the face of a decades-long drought that dried up precious springs. This, perhaps in combination with environmental degradation and political pressures, may have caused the Ancient Puebloans to abandon their magnificent mesas. Several of the Mesa Verde cliff dwellings can be toured, including the 150-room Cliff Palace and Long House, as well as the Spruce Tree House and Balcony House. Of those, only the Spruce Tree House allows self-guided tours; to see most of the major cliff dwellings, visitors must take a ranger-led tour. Information about tours and the history and ecology of the park are available on the park website. www.nps.gov/meve/index.htm. Petra, Jordan It's not hard to understand why Petra is one of the world's most famous archaeological sites -- made even more so by its appearance in the 1989 film "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade." Enclosed by mountains and sheer rock, the city was carved out of massive cliffs of rose-colored sandstone 2,000 years ago by the Nabataeans, an Arab tribe. Despite its location in a barren desert prone to flash floods, the Nabataeans' sophisticated water system helped Petra survive and grow to become a major hub for trade routes linking China, India, the Mediterranean and the Middle East. In its heyday, massive trading caravans passed through the city. Petra eventually came under Roman rule, and a series of powerful earthquakes hastened its declined. It was eventually abandoned, although Bedouin tribes continued to watch over the magnificent ruins. To visit Petra, you must walk, ride a horse or take a horse-drawn carriage along the Siq road, a narrow passage of glowing rose-orange sandstone. At the end of the Siq is the magnificent Al Kazhneh, or "The Treasury," carved from a cliff and once believed to store untold riches. As the valley widens, the full splendor of Petra is revealed: elaborate tombs, eerie caves and an amphitheater constructed from the hillside. Two museums inside Petra display the city's art and artifacts. www.visitjordan.com. Knossos, Greece Five miles inland from the coast of Crete, Knossos was the center of the Minoan civilization, a powerful Bronze Age culture that flourished between about 3000 B.C. and 1400 B.C. According to myth, the god Zeus had a son, Minos, who became king of Knossos. Among the many legends about King Minos is that his wife gave birth to the Minotaur, a man-eating monster who was half-human, half-bull. Daedalus, an Athenian craftsman, designed a labyrinth in which to trap the Minotaur, and was later trapped there himself. Although there is much scholarly debate about the existence and location of the labyrinth, the myths speak of the Minoan empire's regional influence. Fueled by trade and their mastery of the sea, Knossos to become an advanced city with running water, paved roads and fine art, including elaborate metal work, pottery and brilliant frescoes. But when the mainland Greeks finally seized Crete, the Minoan civilization had already begun to crumble. Why? There are competing theories about what exactly brought down the Minoans. Most involve a massive volcanic eruption on the nearby island of Santorini, which sent an explosive plume of gas and ash miles into the sky. Some scientists believe the force of the volcano caused a tsunami, and it may even have altered the climate. If so, the result for the Minoans would have been devastating: badly damaged infrastructure, the heart of its trading center destroyed, its crops ruined. Within a couple of generations, Knossos and the broader Minoan civilization was hardly capable of defending their territory. Among the many highlights is the Palace of Knossos. Sometimes characterized as a town in itself, it had a huge central courtyard, public baths with running water and hundreds of rooms that served as shrines, workshops, storage and living quarters for a king and his vast household. Copies of vibrant frescoes with dolphins and dancing ladies in the royal apartments are also not to be missed. www.visitgreece.gr. The lost city of Atlantis For centuries, scholars have studied and debated the location of the lost city of Atlantis, which the ancient Greek philosopher Plato told was a city submerged beneath the sea overnight. But was this myth or fact? And if fact, where, exactly, does Atlantis lie? Theories have ranged from Cyprus, to North Africa to Santorini. (Remember the volcano thought to have brought down Knossos?) In 2011, an international research team grabbed headlines with the announcement that they may have discovered Atlantis in southern Spain, buried in the marshlands of Doana National Park. Using specialized radar and under water digital mapping tools, they found evidence of prior human habitation and suggested that this could be Atlantis, claimed by the sea during an ancient tsunami. Although the theory was strongly rejected by some, the investigation continues. For travelers endowed with a bit of imagination, a trip to Doana will be rewarding, regardless of the accuracy of the claim. For starters, the park is less than an hour's journey from Cadiz and Seville, two historic cities that should be on everyone's bucket list. You won't get to walk among any ruins, but this UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, with its rich diversity of birds and other wildlife, is an impressive setting in which to contemplate a lost civilization. www.spain.info/en.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/14/travel/irpt-library-fascination-travel/index.html	travel	Libraries are dying? Think again - CNN.com	2014/04/14	Monday Apr 14 08:59:12 EDT 2014	In honor of National Library Week, CNN iReport is asking people to share photos of their favorite libraries. Share your best photos here. (CNN) -- Like many visitors in Seattle, Glenn Nagel found himself in the city trying to avoid the rain. After wandering around, he eventually made his way to the Seattle Public Library to escape the dreary weather. Little did he know that stepping into Seattle's Central Library would spark his curiosity. The library's geometric glass and steel interior with its sprawling "books spiral" grabbed ahold of him. "It's just an incredible building," he said, still remembering his awe during that 2013 trip. "I spent an hour and a half just taking pictures, and while doing that, I was getting the idea that I should visit other libraries." This past year, Nagel has traveled to 12 libraries across the United States, photographing their shelves and hallways like an explorer. He's one of many people discovering a renewed fascination with libraries. He and other iReporters shared photos of libraries they visited with CNN iReport for National Library Week, observed April 13-19 this year. Despite the expansive digitalization of information, the use of public libraries remains popular, according to Cathy De Rosa, vice president for the Americas and global vice president of marketing at OCLC, a nonprofit computer library service organization. "It surprises people," she said, explaining there's a presumption amongst the public that libraries are becoming increasingly irrelevant. But despite enduring budget cutbacks and being forced to reinvent their services in the face of the ubiquitous Internet, public libraries remain staple institutions in various communities. There's been an increase in the use of public libraries in the U.S. over the past decade. Services such as public computers doubled in usage in the past 10 years, and libraries saw a circulation increase of 2.46 billion materials in 2010, the highest ever reported, according to a report by the Institute of Museum and Library Services. Some libraries bring in more than just patrons. They are also popular amongst tourists, drawing visitors by the tens of thousands, if not millions. The Seattle Public Library system, for example, attracts more than 7 million people through its doors each year. "The Central Library is one of the most beautiful modern buildings in Seattle, and it really celebrates the people," said Andra Addison, a spokesperson for the library. Smaller libraries matter, too Americans strongly value the role of public libraries in their community, according to findings by the Pew Research Center. In fact, 94% of people polled in 2013 said that having a public library improves the quality of life in a community. Jennifer Roberts, a writing teacher, agrees. She spent many summer days with her daughters, Lucy and Miriam, visiting their local library in Grants Pass, Oregon. But in 2007, all the libraries in Josephine County closed down for a number of reasons. It devastated her daughters who were then 7 and 5. "Lucy told me she was really sad she wouldn't get to 'visit the books,' " Roberts said, remembering her daughter sobbing at the news. Roberts was determined to find a way to help reopen the libraries in her area. The community banded together to raise $300,000 in 18 months. They even got a matching grant from Josephine County, which helped the libraries reopen. The experience helped Roberts rediscover the value of her local library. "I actually didn't grow up visiting many libraries," she said. "I didn't discover that wonder until I was much older. Perhaps that's why they seem so magical to me now." 'Libraries reflect who we are' Robert Dawson wanted to capture the value of public libraries through his lens. He spent the past 18 years photographing libraries and interviewing people who work and use them. In his recently published book, "The Public Library: A Photographic Essay," which includes hundreds of photographs of libraries in 48 states, Dawson says he was drawn to libraries because they are vital part of a community's ecosystem. "Often times, a library reveals things about a community. It was really sad to see a closed library when I was passing through the Mississippi Delta," he said, explaining how that was one of the poorer regions he visited. "I am not a librarian, but 18 years of doing this, you peel away things," he said. "It's interesting how libraries reflect who we are, and what we share. Barbara Stripling, president of the American Library Association, says libraries are also incredibly transformative. These spaces offer not only information but also provide resources and opportunities to socialize. Some libraries are "becoming more of a community sharing, learning, conversation space," she explained. Programs such as the Chicago Public Library's One Book, One Chicago, an initiative adopted from the Seattle Public Library, aims to rally virtual community engagement around monthly book selections. Take a tour of the world's most exquisite libraries  Others are rebranding themselves as places where people can explore their passions. Programs such as Geek the Library, which is part of OCLC, partners with libraries to promote the idea that everyone "geeks out" about something, and a local library can help you recognize your special passion. Through his 18 years of documenting libraries, Dawson says he's seen many of them adapt and transform for their communities. Some took on new daily roles, such as teaching people to write resumes or providing social services. "In San Francisco, they have a dedicated social worker, especially for the homeless," he said. Others became safe havens. "When I was in Detroit, it one of the hottest days on record, I walked into a library. There was this huge guard at the front, the air conditioning was blasting, it was packed, and everyone was reading. And I sort of got it -- it was a place of shelter." Olaf Eigenbrodt, librarian and senior head of user services and adviser for planning and construction at State and University Library Hamburg in Germany, says there are three main reasons why libraries continue to be popular today: They are information hotspots; they are places communities can gather; and they provide learning collaboration. They even provide an element of comfort. "Libraries tend to become more cozy, relaxing and communicative places. Other than public spaces like museums, they have a certain private character, which makes them a living room for their community," Eigenbrodt said. Dawson thinks a part of people's fascination with libraries is sort of irrational, too, but in a good way. He attributes our love for libraries to our childhood memories. "I think a lot of it goes back to being a kid. There's an emotional connection that is somewhat unique. A lot of kids discover libraries with their parents when they are younger," he explained. That affinity can be partially psychological, according to De Rosa of OCLC. "I would find it difficult to find 10 people in a crowd who didn't have a positive experience in a library. That's a personal thing," she said. "It's why libraries continue to be relevant." Addison, from the Seattle Public Library, says the most alluring factor of a public library is simple -- it's free. "Where else can you go that offers all this for free? Whether you're in a three-piece suit or a three-day beard, you can go into a library and be welcomed." CNN's Daphne Sashin and Margaret Blaha, special to CNN, contributed to this story. 
http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/06/travel/escape-debate-all-inclusive-resorts/index.html	travel	In defense of the all-inclusive resort - CNN.com	2014/02/06	Thursday Feb 6 08:25:06 EST 2014	(CNN) -- We see your nose turning up at the notion of booking an all-inclusive resort in Mexico or Jamaica or the Bahamas. Are you picturing bad buffets, cheap booze and partying within the resort walls, never leaving to explore local culture? All that does exist, and more power to you if you're not picky about uncomplicated, affordable R&R. Some 14% of U.S. travelers stayed in an all-inclusive in 2012, compared to 8% in 2010, according to Douglas Quinby, PhoCusWright's vice president of research. We know all-inclusive resorts aren't always the most daring way to go on vacation. And if you're dead set against it, just skip it. But if you're on the fence -- curious but worried about the stereotypes -- read on as we look at some of the half-truths of this travel experience. There's as much variety among all-inclusive resorts as there is among hotels, and it's up to you to find the right one for you. It's not all included "All-inclusive" generally means travelers are charged one price for their rooms, all food and drink (including certain alcohol brands) and some other activities, says Tom Hall, the England-based director of Lonely Planet's online editorial. Package prices can vary, depending on the size and location of your room. Upscale alcohol brands, motorized water sports, spa treatments and off-site excursions are generally not included, but they could be at your resort. "What you actually get for your money differs from resort to resort," Hall says. Some resorts offer "resort credits" that can be used toward the not-included resort expenses. It's not always cheap While packaging may yield significant savings, you can easily spend a bundle depending on your choice of budget versus elegant all-inclusive, which country you visit, the time of year you're traveling, room size and room location (ocean versus garden view). And off-site excursions and spa treatments add to the tab. A week for two at a budget all-inclusive resort with the typical buffet line could cost $1,150 to $1,600, while a moderate all-inclusive with a few more food choices could cost $1,650 to $3,500, says Sara Butruff, a Travel Leaders travel agent in Apple Valley, Minnesota. A premium all-inclusive resort could cost from $3,600 to $10,000 or moreand lots of amenities could be included in that high-end choice. But there's value in knowing the final price up front. With everything paid for ahead of time, "you know exactly how much your room and meals will be, and if you don't want to, you don't have to spend another dime," says Debby Simonton, a stay-at-home mom in Coplay, Pennsylvania, who loves to take her family to all-inclusive resorts every couple of years. To Disney or not to Disney? It's not all bland buffet food Simonton knows how to work the food options at all-inclusive resorts. Her favorite spot, Hilton Rose Hall Resort & Spa in Jamaica, offers six restaurant options (some with reservations required), two bars and room service. Simonton loves to try dishes that might be too expensive at home if it turns out she doesn't like them. But she's also happy for the resorts to have food she knows everyone in her family will like. And what about that buffet line? "Learning how to 'work' a buffet comes with a little practice," she says. "Want your omelet to have better cheese than the shredded cheddar the omelet chef has? Go to the cheese bar, grab some and take it to the chef." Basic all-inclusives offer buffets and local brand alcohol, while the moderate all-inclusives may offer lobster or other fancier fare for a surcharge, says Butruff, the Minnesota travel agent. Premium resorts often have more restaurants, a la carte restaurants and premium spiritsall included. Camping: Horror or bliss? Resorts owned by the same company may offer reciprocal dining privileges to give you diverse dining options. "Let's say you are staying at the Sandals Royal Caribbean in Jamaica," says American Express travel agent Linda D'Arcy, based in Oak Brook, Illinois. "You can grab the complimentary transfer over to the Sandals Montego Bay resort and eat (complimentary) at the Japanese restaurant on site at the Sandals Mo Bay, which they do not have at the Sandals Royal Caribbean property." Some resorts include dining coupons in resort packages, which guests can use in town for dinner at no extra cost. For a fixed additional fee, you can often add specialty courses to your stay. Karisma's El Dorado Royale resort in the Riviera Maya, Mexico, charges an additional $260 for its weeklong wine experience, which includes tastings, cooking courses, pairings and a special dinner. A variation on the all-inclusive There also are resorts that offer flexible -- and often elegant-- food packages. The cost is set so you're not surprised, but you can opt out of some daily meals to allow for exploration of local dining spots. Beverly Ross recently returned from the Spa Retreat Boutique Hotel in Negril, where she chose a meal plan that was incorporated into the total cost of her stay. Ross researched all-inclusive vacations in Jamaica before choosing the Spa Retreat, which offers partially inclusive and all-inclusive meal plans. "The menu was designed around local fresh fish and produced with healthy eating in mind. It was not a buffet and the chef would prepare what you requested," said Ross, a sociologist who teaches at California University of Pennsylvania. Is your cruise ship safe? Not thinking is not an option Fail to do your research about what's included (or not) at a particular resort and you're more likely to get stuck with food that doesn't satisfy, too-cheap alcohol, cheesy staff entertainment or high prices for off-site excursions. You might even show up during hurricane season or the colder time of year. Some resorts have local brews as part of their included alcohol but charge extra for top-shelf brands, if they carry them at all. Resort restaurants--and the number and quality varies from resort to resort--may have restrictions on how many nights you can reserve a table at their swankier spots. The fancier the resort, the more likely it is to carry higher-end brands and serve higher-end food, and include them in the price. Minnesota-based Butruff sends lots of cold-weather clients to warm-weather resorts. Couples often come into her office with completely different ideas about what they want on vacation, so she quizzes them. "What do you want to do on vacation?" she says. "What types of hotels have you already stayed in? What types of adventures have you had?" "Often what they want is not what they've said they want." It's not all drunken parties (unless you want it to be) All-inclusive alcoholic drinks are part of the appeal. But you can choose a resort that focuses on lots of drinking way into the night or one that shuts down the bars at 8 p.m. Some resorts keeps the intensive drinking segregated to the resort bar or elsewhere. The more upscale resorts will be a little quieter, says D'Arcy, although their clientele aren't necessarily limiting their drinking. "I have seen people who are very drunk but expertly handled by the staff." The drinking doesn't bother Melissa McCloud. "As far as the sometimes crazy party scene, if that is not your thing, go hang out elsewhere on the resort," says McCloud, a stay-at-home mom from Bolingbrook, Illinois, who visits all-inclusive resorts once or twice per year. "These all-inclusives are usually huge places, and there are plenty of places to go and things to do that do not involve that!" 50 states, 50 spots for 2014 It doesn't mean you're dull It's true that some people just want to chill out on vacation, sitting by the pool or beach with free-flowing fruity drinks. There's nothing wrong with that, especially when there's an Arctic tundra at home. But you don't have to stay within the walls. Step out and explore local food and culture, swim with the dolphins and do zip lining for a fee. (Look for resort credits to fund those excursions.) If you want that local flavor, choose a resort that's not miles and miles from the closest towns and attractions. Some people want a specific sense of community that all-inclusives can provide, whether it's a focus on hedonism, romance, LGBT families or sobriety. Sober Vacations International has taken over Club Med Turquoise in the Turks & Caicos the week ending February 8, 2014. Reserving the resort allows people in recovery to vacation with the support of other people trying to stay sober. There's no need to be so snide And be wary, you hip, do-it-yourself critics of the all-inclusive resort. Right now you're backpacking through Latin America, jumping off trains in Eastern Europe when you hear about a cool new art installation, or strolling through Tokyo to track down the latest underground bar. Now put a baby in your Ergo baby carrier. Not so cool anymore, right? A few years from now, you may be partnered with kids in diapers, says Lonely Planet's Hall. Cool is less important than a full night's sleep, teaching your daughter to swim or holding your spouse's hand as you watch the sunset. "An all-inclusive may be the way to go," he says. Maybe you'll even want to bring the grandparents. Have you been to an all-inclusive resort? Why or why not? Please share your thoughts and experiences in the comments section below.   
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/26/travel/mount-everest-american-climber/index.html	travel	An empty Everest: But should you climb? - CNN.com	2014/05/26	Monday May 26 11:45:42 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- At Camp 3 of Mount Everest at an altitude of 7,200 meters, an American woman, 50-year-old Cleonice Pacheco Weidlich, sits in a solitary tent. Outside, fierce winds of more than 50 knots are raging. She waits. Soon blizzard-bearing monsoon clouds will gather around Everest and bring an end to the climbing season on the high Himalayas. It will also draw a shroud over one of the single deadliest tragedies the world's highest mountain has ever witnessed. Before she can make begin her ascent, Weidlich must not only find a gap in the weather and a way over the avalanche, but also face down the growing controversies that erupted around continued activity on Everest in the wake of the disaster. More than 300 international climbers abandoned their goal of reaching the mountain's summit after an April 18 avalanche in the mountain's treacherous Khumbu Icefall killed 16 Nepalese Sherpa mountaineers. The immediate aftermath of the disaster brought confusion and anger to the mountain as arguments raged over whether climbing should continue, the money paid to Sherpas and compensation for the sacrifices made. After avalanche, Nepal opens up unclimbed peaks Domino effect Some Sherpas called an unofficial moratorium on further climbs, with one group even reportedly sabotaging equipment. With safety in doubt, many international climbing companies decided to pull the plug, leading to a domino effect that also swept up the independent climbers who rely on shared resources. "If 30% of your workforce walks away, it compromises your operational capabilities, given the difficulties of finding new porters, cooks, and guides in short time in the Khumbu," said one guide from a leading operator. Many were resigned to the sudden end to the season. "I feel very sad about the Sherpas," said Ake Lindstrom, an adventure operator from Tanzania. "Everybody knows each other; it is a small community and their loss is very tangible. It takes a small amount of empathy to let go of one's frustration." Weidlich, however, stayed. Later she was joined by Wang Jing, a 41-year-old Chinese woman also determined to press ahead with an attempt on the summit. Despite their determination in the face of calls for a halt to climbing, many Sherpas CNN Travel spoke to were not unhappy with their plans. Instead, they voiced other concerns, including the disparity they perceive between local and international guide salaries, overcrowding on the mountain, a lack of respect to their mountain god and those who died. There was also anger towards the Nepalese government over its response to the tragedy. Among the Everest climbing community questions were raised about the safety prior to the deaths. Some Sherpas said there had been too many on the mountain on the day of the disaster, with long lines forming as people traversed the ladders over crevasses. Mourning in an Everest Sherpa village 'One mistake and you are done' "It was so packed that for some, there was no place to hide when the ice started to fall," one said. "We never saw so many people on the icefall on one day." One expert expressed strong concerns about renewed climbing. "The mountains are in constant movement, which is what makes the icefall dangerous," said Gian Piero Verza, of the Pyramid high-altitude research center, located at 5,050 meters on Everest. "You have to consider that in two months of expeditions, some Sherpas spend an average of three hours daily on the icefall to carry their load. For some that is 200 hours in a very dangerous place." Veteran expedition leader Jamie McGuinness, however, said he was surprised that more did not defy the exodus to take advantage of conditions similar to those when Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay first summited in 1953. "Hard-core mountaineers would jump at the chance to have Everest and Lhotse all for themselves during the best climbing season," he says. "But being there without backup is like being back in epic Hillary's time: one mistake and you are done." Back at Camp 3, in her gale-battered tent, Weidlich is convinced she is doing the right thing by continuing with her plan to summit Lhotse, a peak connected to Everest's South Col. She says she knows the family of one of the victims and when she visited them after the disaster was not met with hostility and was invited to stay for the funeral. "I asked them if they felt it would be disrespectful if I continued with my climbing plan," she says. "They were concerned about my safety, but they never brought up the issue of respect." Weidlich, who is on a personal mission to climb all 14 of the world's mountains over 8,000 meters, says the problem lies with assisted climbing. "High mountains are dangerous, and climbing is all about the experience. You have to evaluate the risks. But Everest has become a completely different place: it is a showtime place. People come here to make silly records. American climber recounts how Sherpa saved his life Climbing in isolation "This is not real mountaineering. To me, if you cannot free climb a mountain and you need someone else to help you up or down, you don't belong on it." Weidlich hits out at claims that Sherpas had forced people to abandon the mountain saying they had treated her well. She also speaks of the excitement of climbing in isolation. "I am very much looking forward to experiencing the mountain for what it is, without the crowds. It will be rewarding to be in contact with nature -- to hear the cracking of the ice and not the generators." When at last the gales ease, it is finally time for Weidlich to face the mountain, but she is ultimately unable to reach her goal. Because of the dangers on the Icefall, both Weidlich and Wang bypass it using helicopters -- a highly controversial move that could invalidate any claim to a successful climb. Wang reaches the summit of Everest on May 23 along with five Sherpas. Weidlich, however, decides to abandon her attempt on Lhotse because "that would be like claiming a whole mountain when I would only have climbed half of it." Shortly afterward, the monsoon closes in for good, leaving Everest to brood alone over another season of triumphs for some and tragedies for others.

Nevertheless, behind this simple cavern's red doors, stenciled with the image of Bacchus, lie barrels of the best wine to be found in one of Hungary's most beautiful vineyard destinations. Menoire is a half-sweet and fruity red wine, low in tannins. My Hungarian mother, whose family once owned vineyards in the area, would bring me here amid the musty aroma of oak barrels and the waft of red onions on zsiros kenyer -- bread topped with lard, onion and paprika. The wine would be decanted unceremoniously into a huge two-liter recycled Coke bottle. 'Not the rubbish you get in supermarkets' For her, the wine in the Szepasszonyvolgy recalled her student days in the city's college and her family's connection with the area. "Your grandfather made white wine like this," she said when tasting a glass of Csersegi Fuszeres, another local favorite. "This is proper cellar wine, not the rubbish you get in the supermarkets." MORE: Budapest's breakout clubs go global They take wine very seriously in this part of northeastern Hungary, close to the edge of the Bukk Mountains. At one time the local red "bulls blood" was supposed to give residents of the main town of Eger supernatural strength to ward off vampirism -- a legend born from its violent past as a trophy in battles with Ottoman invaders. Even when my mother's family lost its vineyards after World War II, my grandfather never gave up making his own wine. Today, wine is still the blood that flows through the town's culture. Eger is the ideal destination for wine fans looking for an informal tasting trip. The lack of pretension in the cellars is a big plus for those wanting an introduction to the local produce. 'Bull's blood' It's the topographical ingredients of the Eger region that make it ideal for winemaking. It has limestone and clay-based slopes along with a cool climate, not dissimilar to Burgundy in France. Eger's grape-growing country spreads out into 5,000 hectares of vineyards, and includes wines areas that carry a protected status. Among them is Debroi Harslevelu, a golden wine produced in Eger's Debro district that carries the aroma of linden flowers and a rich sweetness. Others include Egri Bikaver (better known as the anti-vampiric "bull's blood"). Synonymous with Eger, Egri Bikaver is one of Hungary's most famous red wines, known for its ruby color and spicy notes. The wine comprises a blend of at least three of 17 red grape types from the Eger district. It varies between wineries, but the Kadarka grape, supposedly brought over during the Ottoman occupation, often anchors it. Szepasszonyvolgy and its more than 200 wine cellars are easily reached from the center of Eger via the miniature train that departs from Egeszseghaz Street. Each cellar has its own distinct flavor.

The ones located at the base of the valley pulse at night from local activity and live gypsy music, while others are more spartan, pulling in the crowds with quality wine. The Hagymasi Cellar, at number 19, is by far the most spectacular, a cathedral to wine carved under the hill. It's worth visiting for the architecture alone, or for its pince lepeny, a buckwheat pancake filled with ham and cheese -- perfect to soak up the alcohol. And, of course, at the top of the hill, at number 28-29, there's the Golen Cellar. These days there's no need to bring your own recycled Coke bottle.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/14/travel/rio-lapa/index.html	travel	Moving to the rhythms of Rio's Lapa nightlife district - CNN.com	2014/05/14	Wednesday May 14 01:59:17 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- The banner on the back wall of the old dance hall says in Portuguese: "While there is dance, we still have hope." There's plenty of that as the crowd of Cariocas (Rio locals) shake hips and move their feet on the worn, wooden dance floor to an eight-piece band playing irresistible samba. The cheap Brahma beer is flowing, the tables are close together and new friends are made easily. It's a euphoric window on local life, courtesy of Estudantina Musical, a place that's been serving up happy feet on the periphery of the Lapa district of Rio for 85 years. By the end of the night, I've met Reynaldo dos Santos, a retired businessman, who's here every Friday night. His advice for anyone trying to improve their samba dancing: Don't worry about anyone else. Move what you can while you can and "don't have shame." Rio's Lapa district can help you with that. It's the headquarters for the best clubs, nightlife and music in Rio, with an emphasis on the vital rhythm that unites all Brazilians -- samba. Walk a few blocks in this compact collection of 19th-century edifices and you'll be treated to a host of joints hopping with live music and particularly samba. MORE: 8 of Brazil's best beaches The Monmatre of Rio At one bar, it's an acoustic samba de roda group with drums and cavaquinho, a steel-stringed ukelele-sized instrument. At another club, there's a lively band with a horn section doing samba gafieira, the swinging brass version of the music that fuels couples dancing. At another, you might hear choro, a guitar-based precursor of samba. Lapa is the historic cultural heart of Rio, where bohemians and artists have gathered through the decades. It was once called the Montmarte of Rio, after the artist quarter in Paris. By the 1970s it had become a seedy, derelict zone to avoid. But as has happened in so many cities, redevelopment revitalized it into a nightlife hub. Many of the old mansions in the area, home to Rio's wealthy until the arrival of the 20th century, have been restored and now house bars, cafes and clubs. The sidewalks of Lapa are buzzing most nights until the early hours, with musical options ranging from the traditional -- samba, choro, forro -- to Musica Popular Brasileira (MPB), a signature Brazilian take on modern pop and rock that's produced great artists such as Caetano Veloso and Milton Nascimento. MORE: Five-minute guide to Brazilian barbecue More than partying ... but, still, partying Even if it weren't a hive of music and partying, Lapa would be worth a visit. The double decker Roman-style aqueduct, Arcos da Lapa, hearkens to the 1700s, when Rio drew its water from the hills above. The 19th-century mansions, dressed up in a variety of colorful pastels, look like they were beamed in from old Lisbon. Lapa feels more like Portugal than the modern Brazil of Copacabana and Ipanema. Top music venues include Rio Scenarium and Carioca da Gema, where the best known samba artists perform regularly. Samba grew out of a fusion of African drum circles and European marches and choro. There are many styles of samba, and you can catch a lot of them in Lapa. Samba chronicles the struggles of life and love, and conquers them through the joy of the music. It allows participants to jiu-jitsu a bad day at the drop of a cavaquinho, the hyper instrument that revs samba. Here's some of the top spots for music.

The 34.76- meter (114 feet) tower, which was completed on Sunday, has been certified as the world's tallest toy brick structure by Guinness World Records. It beat the previous record holder, a 34.4-meter structure constructed last year with the help of U.S. students from a school in Delaware. A spokesman for Guinness World Records confirmed that the tower qualified as the "tallest structure built with interlocking plastic bricks." He said the record was officially registered to Lego Store Budapest on May 25. The Budapest tower, topped by a Rubik's cube -- a Hungarian invention -- was also built with the help of Hungarian primary school children, according to local news websites. The structure, built in front of the city's St. Stephen's Basilica, used hundreds of thousands of blocks.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/23/travel/50-state-travelers-what-counts/index.html	travel	Visiting all 50 states: What counts? - CNN.com	2014/05/23	Friday May 23 04:42:56 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- For those on a quest to visit all 50 United States, each one is like a jagged piece of a very large jigsaw puzzle. Fitting in all 50 states is an impressive achievement. In fact, anyone who knocks 35 off the list is eligible for membership in the exclusive All Fifty Club, an organization that recognizes individuals who make it to every state with a plaque or certificate to commemorate their accomplishment.  To "visit" a state, a person has to step outside the airport and breathe the air, according to the organization's website. Airport layovers mean nothing. Those who are truly passionate about making it to all 50 states often have their own criteria for crossing them off the list, from a hard-core requirement of staying in a state for more than a month to simply hopping out of the car to snap a picture at the border. American odyssey: 50 states in 31 years CNN asked avid 50-staters to run down their requirements. Here's how it's done: Go beyond the border Back in 1976, Don Carswell of New Jersey, now 53, and his friend Tom White made a bet to see who would be the first one to set foot in all 50 states. At stake was a six-pack of beer. In order to count a state as "visited," the two men agreed that they had to spend at least one full hour in a state during the day, be outdoors at least part of the time, set foot on the actual ground, and go beyond the state's border. Airport property also didn't count. The bet lasted 15 years, until Carswell received a postcard from White declaring he had reached his 50th state. Carswell was still two states shy of completing his goal, making sure he followed the criteria they set when they first made the bet. It took seven more years for Carswell to visit Oregon, the one state he needed. "Being one state shy annoyed me. I needed to take matters into my own hands," he said. Sent to San Francisco on business in 1998, he extended his stay to rent a car and drive north to Oregon. "I was sure to send Tom a card," Carswell recalled. It simply said, '50!' " 50 states, 50 spots to visit in 2014 Let the kids choose Together the Holmes family of Pennsylvania has traveled to 40 states. Their oldest child, Cate, is barely a teenager. Wendy Holmes says that she and her husband, Chris, have been taking their 13-year-old daughter Cate and 7-year-old son Tom on trips since they were infants. Once Cate and Tom were old enough, Holmes and her husband started letting them take turns deciding where the family would go each year. Because the family often drives to their destinations, they try to stop in as many states as they can in one trip. "We're not competitive," Holmes said, but they are strategic. "We do have plans on which states to visit over the next few years so that we do hit 50 before our daughter leaves for college." Holmes keeps track of the states they've seen in an Excel spreadsheet, using the list to plan what stops they'll make on future trips. "We drive so much on our vacations and camp a lot. We've actually gotten out and seen the states." The family typically stays in each state they visit for three days, but apart from how long they stay, there's really only one other agreed-upon criterion. "My husband has (visited) 46 states. He's not allowed to get to 50 unless we're all together." Go back to fill in the blanks Justin Clark Pollard had a deadline to meet. He and his wife, Dana, had been taking long road trips during their summers off from teaching since 2009. It wasn't until their second big road trip in 2012 that they saw how close they were to visiting all 50 states, and they decided to go for it. But Pollard wanted to push this goal even further. The deadline: His 30th birthday. "I used (turning) 30 as a reason to do this, to keep traveling places I might not go otherwise," he said. On an old road atlas he keeps in the glove compartment of a baby blue Nissan, Pollard kept track of all the states he and his wife visited. At the bare minimum, he considers getting a snapshot at a state's border beneath the welcome sign enough to circle it on his map. But on average he and his wife try to stay in each state at least two days. They even took seasonal jobs at Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska for seven weeks so they would have the opportunity to really witness its wildlife. When they got back home to Georgia after their Alaska trip, Pollard's deadline was fast approaching. With only three weeks until he turned 30, the couple packed up and raced to hit the two states they had yet to see: Michigan and Wisconsin. Despite their short stay in each state, Pollard was not disappointed. "No matter how much time I stay in a state, I'm never going to see the whole thing," he said. These road trips are "highlight trips." Now that he and his wife have seen all 50 states, they're able to stay in one place a little longer. "On the road trips we saw what all the states were known for, and now we can go back and explore them in depth."  Connect with people Long-time friends Kristin Sweetman and Katie Stern, both 29, have put their lives on hold to embark on a seven-month journey across the country, volunteering in each state they visit. "We were both at points where we needed direction in our lives. We were both in ruts and needed a change to do something else," said Sweetman, who quit her job before leaving on this trip. Since the two women started on their journey from their homes in Minnesota on April 28, they have already picked up nine states. They have been staying in each state for anywhere from three to five days, devoting one full day to volunteering and staying at campsites or with other volunteers they work with. In West Virginia, the women worked in a community garden with Conscious Harvest Cooperative, a group of West Virginia University students and Morgantown residents who grow food for local pantries. In the Adirondacks in upstate New York, they found a local farmer and helped him grow tomatoes. Next, they're volunteering in Boston with Hope Lodge, baking snacks for the families of cancer patients. They're journaling and blogging about their experiences in each state, and they use a calendar to keep themselves organized and on track. But they're really in no rush to finish their journey across the country. They want to live in the moment and see where it takes them, Sweetman says. "We want to connect with the different people we meet on this trip," Sweetman said. "There are so many people who have opened their homes and their hearts to us, and that's how we get a true idea of what a place is really like."  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/19/travel/crazy-rock-formations/index.html	travel	13 crazy rock formations across the United States - CNN.com	2014/05/19	Monday May 19 08:56:21 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Our planet is chock full of the beautiful and bizarre. Give nature millions of years to work its magic and some pretty weird formations emerge from solid rock. From violent volcanic eruptions to the slow movement of wind and water, the forces of nature have made the United States, particularly the western half of the country, a showcase for wild-looking sculpture. Here are some of the most awe-inspiring places in the country to witness these odd rock formations: Mono Lake Tufa State Natural Reserve, California To visit Mono Lake is to behold an other-worldly landscape. Located just 13 miles east of Yosemite National Park, this ancient lake receives salt and minerals from Sierra streams, creating calcium carbonate spires called tufa towers that rise majestically from the water. As fresh water evaporates from the lake, it leaves behind the salt, making the lake more than twice as salty as the ocean and offering visitors the opportunity for a buoyant swim during warmer summer months. In winter, snow glitters dramatically on the tufas. Stop at the visitors center to learn more about the natural history of the region, then try the self-guided nature trail to experience this unique landscape firsthand. It's a paradise for photographers and nature lovers. World's scariest, best water slides Goblin Valley State Park, Utah Southern Utah is one of the most spectacular geological shows on Earth. With so many peculiar rock formations here, visits to Bryce Canyon, Arches or Canyonlands National Parks, to name a few, will not disappoint. But two parks really stand out in the category of rocks with character. One is Goblin Valley State Park near the town of Green River. Below dramatic red buttes and cliffs lies a valley populated with thousands of uncannily mushroom-shaped hoodoos, rock pillars shaped by water erosion and dust blown across the valley, that resemble goblins. Every hour and every weather condition creates a different mood in this surreal landscape. In the winter, the park offers snowshoeing and skiing amid a breathtaking scene of snow on red rocks. Stay for sunset and see the goblins glow like burning embers. 10 record-setting natural wonders in the U.S. Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, Utah Escalante-Grand Staircase National Monument is Utah's other rock star. This enormous, 1.7 million acre property offers hikes to spectacular formations like Metate Arch in Devil's Garden and the Wahweap Hoodoos, slender, ghostly rocks that can reach several stories high. For a short and easy hike, try the Toadstools Trail to see special white, beige and red hoodoos formed by large boulders perched above softer, eroded rock. They give new meaning to the term "magic mushrooms." Stop at the Bureau of Land Management office in Kanab or Escalante to review maps, learn about weather advisories and other information important in preparing for the harsh conditions in this sometimes other-worldly land. Shiprock, Navajo Nation, New Mexico Driving north from Gallup, New Mexico, on State Route 491 toward the Four Corners Monument, one passes through the vast, arid lands of the eastern Navajo Nation. To the north are the Rockies. To the west, the Chuska Mountains on the border of Arizona and New Mexico. And to the east, the dusty, sparsely-vegetated landscape of the San Juan Basin seems to go on forever, like a wide dry sea. But eventually, a jagged dark figure looms on the horizon like ship sailing through the desert -- or, as Navajos refer to it, "rock with wings." Shiprock is the remnants of a volcano that erupted more than 30 million years ago. At nearly 1,600 feet, it's the single most prominent figure on this desert landscape. There are no amenities at the site, and it is forbidden to hike or climb on this sacred peak. Just pull off the road for a stunning photo, or walk around to enjoy sound of the wind as it blows dramatic cloud shadows across the plain, and contemplate the immensity of this powerful place. Valley of Fire State Park, Nevada Just an hour's drive from the Las Vegas Strip, Valley of Fire State Park offers a number of impressive rock formations created by shifting sand dunes during the Mesozoic era some 150 million years ago. Of the dozens of beautiful and odd formations you'll find here, perhaps none is stranger than Elephant Rock, where erosion has sculpted a slanted arch resembling an elephant's trunk and body. There is a parking lot less than a mile from Elephant Rock and a walking trail to the site. Come on a summer's day when the sun is blazing down on the red sandstone, and you'll agree that the park was aptly named: It's an oven. The rest of the year offers more comfortable temperatures for doing short, relatively easy hikes with opportunities to see wildlife, petrified wood and petroglyphs. Chimney Rock National Historic Site, Nebraska Chimney Rock was a welcome landmark for pioneers making arduous westward journeys along the Oregon, Mormon and California Trails in the early 19th century. The narrow spire juts from a base of volcanic ash and clay, the remnant of an eruption sharpened into a slender tower by millions of years of erosion. A state-owned buffer zone around the rock has prevented development near the site, allowing visitors to see it rise from the grassy prairie in much the same way as pioneers traveling overland in covered wagons. The Nebraska State Historical Society runs a visitor center with information on the natural and human history associated with the Chimney Rock. Makoshika State Park, Montana This park's strange and beautiful rock formations were formed by the Yellowstone River and various streams that have cut through the rock over millions of years, carving out hoodoos, spires and caprocks. The name Makoshika comes from a Lakota word for badlands. Short walks of less than 2 miles afford great views. Try the Cap Rock Nature Trail, the Diane Gabriel Trail and the Kinney Coulee Trail, located just outside the park, which descends into a canyon with a diversity of hoodoos. This is also dinosaur country: Check out the complete Triceratops skull on display at the visitor center, along with remains of a Tyrannosaurus Rex and a rare Thescelosaurus. Turnip Rock, Michigan The unglamorously named Turnip Rock is a stunning sight, particularly on a warm sunny day when the clear, blue-green waters of Lake Huron sparkle. Wave erosion has caused this flat, tree-covered rock island to taper to a narrow base, around which people swim in the summer months. Turnip Rock is located in a portion of eastern Michigan dubbed the Thumb, where 140 miles of coastline and waterfront towns offer a variety of outdoor activities, including biking, walking and kayaking. It's just offshore from private property inaccessible to the general public, so a good way to approach the rock is by kayak, which can be rented in the small village of Port Austin. Kayaking out in pre-dawn darkness to catch the sun rise behind Turnip Rock is a special treat for experienced kayakers. During winter months, the rock ceases to be an island as the lake ices over, creating another dazzling scene. Devils Tower National Monument, Wyoming It is more imposing than any skyscraper as it comes into view, rising more than 867 feet from a grassy, tree-dotted hillside in northeast Wyoming. Devils Tower is not the remnant of an erupted volcano, but instead a place where magma welled up inside the surrounding rock and then cooled. When the rock eroded away, this cylindrical tower with a texture that resembles bear claw marks remained. Many Native American tribes consider it sacred. There are 8 miles of nature trails around the monument that take visitors through grasslands and ponderosa pine forests at its base. Rangers also lead tours of the monument, and the visitors center offers programs and exhibits about the ecological, geological and cultural features of the site. While Devils Tower is a popular site for climbers, this conflicts with some tribes' beliefs about how a sacred site should be treated. The National Park Service asks climbers to voluntarily refrain from ascending during the month of June. Rest assured that the view of the tower from its base is magnificent. Garden of the Gods, Colorado Springs, Colorado It's not what comes to most people's minds when they picture a city park, but the City of Colorado Springs owns and maintains this grand, nearly 1,300-acre assemblage of red rock cliffs, spires and boulders. The park's most famous formation is Balanced Rock, an enormous boulder that from certain angles appears to defy the laws of physics as it perches precariously on the edge of a ledge. This makes it a favorite photo op, of course. The short, easy Siamese Twins trail also offers impressive views of snow-capped Pikes Peak. Monument Rocks, Kansas It's a bit of a surprise to be driving through farmlands near Lewis, Kansas, and suddenly spot a series of tall chalk towers on the horizon. The collection of rocks is a national landmark that looks something like a Stonehenge on the prairie. However, the monoliths at Monument Rocks were carved not by human hands, but by wind and water after a sea that once covered the region receded. That means the rocks also contain a lot of fossils. Visitors can walk among the towers, but be aware: This is private property, and the rocks are very fragile -- so walk lightly here and don't scramble around or dig among them. Natural Bridge, Virginia Located in the southern end of the Shenandoah Valley, Natural Bridge is not only an impressive natural wonder and a national historic landmark, it is steeped in early American history and immortalized in the works of mid-19th century Hudson River School landscape painters Frederic Edwin Church and David Johnson. Cedar Creek, which feeds the James River, carved out an enormous portal in this more than 200-foot high limestone tower, which was once part of an underground cavern that collapsed through the process of water erosion. (Visitors can still tour nearby caverns, the deepest on the East Coast.) Along with Niagara Falls, Natural Bridge was considered one of early America's great natural wonders. Revered by the Monacan tribe as a sacred place, Natural Bridge was later purchased by Thomas Jefferson, who kept it in his estate for the rest of his life. It remained a privately-owned property until earlier this year, when the State of Virginia announced that the bridge and 1,500 surrounding acres would become a state park property by the end of 2015. It is a scenic starting point from which to explore the Cedar Creek Trail and the Monacan Indian Living History Village. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park The island of Hawaii is one of the few places where it's possible to directly witness how volcanoes create strange formations. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park rises from sea level to 13,677 feet at the Mauna Loa Crater and includes diverse geological features like cinder cones, pit craters and living lava. The two active volcanoes here are Mauna Loa and Kilauea. Check out the Banana Lava Flow at the end of Chain of Craters Road, where you may see lava pouring directly into the ocean, and walk the trail leading through the Thurston Lava Tube, a tunnel formed by hot lava flowing beneath a hardened surface. Another intriguing hike is the 1974 Lava Tree and Keanakakoi Crater Hike, which loops through a forest destroyed by a lava flow that coated the trees -- some of which remain standing, although in much-altered form. A word of caution: Stop at the visitor center before venturing to more active parts of the volcano. Although it's possible to get up close and personal with hot, flowing lava, it is dangerous. Know the risks before you go.

Click here for pieces on Italy, France, the United States, Canada, Taiwan, India, Hong Kong and South Korea, and watch for upcoming installments featuring other countries. (CNN) -- Icy beers, empty beaches. It's a compelling image, but it captures only a feeble percentage of the diversity and excellence that imbues one of the most incredible countries in the world. Here are 10 things Mexico does better than anywhere else. Celebrating death Plenty of cultures do ancestor worship. But who else turns the commemoration of their dearly departed into an annual fiesta of art, food and community? On November 1, aka the Day of the Dead, Mexicans put together ofrendas (shrines) for loved ones who have passed away. Every ofrenda includes pictures of the deceased, food, drinks, skull-shaped candies, candles and cempasuchil, the Aztec marigold or flower of the dead. The belief is that souls of children come back to earth to visit family and friends on November 1 and the souls of adults do the same on November 2. Day of the Dead festivals take place across Mexico. Three of the most elaborate are held in San Andrs Mixquic (in Tlhuac, Mexico City), Patzcuaro, Michoacn and Janitzio, Michoacn. MORE: 10 things South Korea does better than anywhere else Horn sections From symphony orchestras to oompah bands to soul and R&B horn sections, everyone loves a blast of brass. Whereas most countries tend to save their horns for parties and special occasions, however, Mexico kicks out the brass jams on a daily basis. Where else can you hear tubas -- actual tubas! -- laying down bass lines on the radio every hour of the week? It all comes down to bandas, the heart of both traditional and popular genres of Mexican music. Bandas are typically comprised of 10 to 20 musicians who play brass instruments, woodwinds and various percussion. Every Mexico traveler is charmed by mariachi, but bandas are a part of several broader genres, the most characteristic being ranchera, quebradita and corridos. MORE: 7 luxury vacations in Mexico Tequila Mexico's national liquor is a worldwide bar standard, with exports to 96 countries. But don't come to Mexico expecting to impress locals by chugging a syrupy sweet margarita or knocking down manly shots all night. Tequila is meant to be sipped and savored, like fine whiskey, which, as any Mexican will tell you, the best tequila can compete with. You can get a taste of the top-shelf stuff on the Tequila Trail, which includes some of the country's most renowned distilleries. Alternates are The Tequila Express tour operated by Casa Herradura and the Jose Cuervo Express tour. MORE: 10 things the U.S. does better than anywhere else Curing hangovers Mexican parties are notorious for going berserk in the blink of a bleary eye. That, of course, leads to a familiar disaster the following morning. Fortunately, Mexico's kitchens spring to life with the best hangover grub on the planet. Wake up, guzzle water then inhale some spicy chilaquiles, carnitas (pork) or barbacoa (sheep) tacos with hot sauce and plenty of revitalizing grease -- maybe slam a light breakfast beer if you're in really rough shape -- and you'll be back making requests from the band by nightfall. MORE: 10 quirkiest hotels in Latin America Double entendre (Albur) Called "albur" in Spanish, double entendre isn't just a linguistic trick for Mexicans, it's an art form requiring a nimble mind and the ability to convey smart but subtle messages, often laced with sexual or R-rated undertones. Many languages, of course, employ veiled connotations and witty wordplay. But albur is so important in Mexico that there's a national tournament to crown the best alburero. The current champ is Lourdes Ruiz, who's won the competition every year since 1997, defeating men and women. She even teaches albur courses. Still not convinced Mexicans take double entendre more seriously than anyone else? What other country has a day devoted to the subtle intricacies of its language? In Mexico, Albur's Day is celebrated on March 1. Diplomado de Albures Finos (Course of Fine/Classy Albures) classes are held at the Galera Jos Mara Velasco (Peralvillo 55, colonia Morelos, Tepito, Mexico City); free admission; participants receive a diploma. MORE: World's 10 weirdest medical museums Catholicism Vatican City does a pretty fair job as the center of the faith and it has some decent paintings on its ceiling. But its population of 800 souls isn't exactly staggering. Mexico, by contrast, ranks second in the world for number of Catholics (Brazil is first, the Philippines third) and, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography of Mexico, 83.9% of the Mexicans are Catholic. Nothing says "Mexican Catholic" like a reverence for the country's seemingly endless manifestations of the Virgin Mary. Which may be why the priest Miguel Hidalgo carried a symbolic flag of Guadalupe when he led the opening stages of the Mexican War of Independence in 1810. Our Lady of Guadalupe is the most venerated Virgin in Mexico, maybe the world. The Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City is also one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Mexico, reportedly the most visited Marian shrine in the world. Each December 12, about 5 million pilgrims from across Mexico visit the Basilica to thank the Virgin for her favors or to ask for a miracle.

Mexicans are constantly on the go, so it's no wonder puestos and changarros (food stands) can be found on practically every corner. It doesn't matter if you're in the subway, leaving school or taking a lunch break away from the office -- Mexico's streets offer endless options for a fast and delicious meal cooked right in front of you with super-fresh ingredients. Soap operas In 1958, Telesistema Mexicano produced "Senda Prohibida" ("Forbidden Path"), the first Mexican telenovela (soap opera). Fifty-six years later, its successor Televisa has produced a whopping 740 telenovelas. The formula hasn't changed much. A man and woman fall in love but, for tragic reasons, can't be together. After overcoming obstacles they finally get married. Fifteen years after exporting its first soap opera, "Los Ricos Tambien Lloran" ("The Rich Cry Too"), Televisa has found a rich market outside Mexico. Of all countries that export soap operas, Mexico ships out the most, carving niches in other Spanish-speaking countries, as well as China, the Philippines, Israel and Saudi Arabia. (Link in Spanish.) Televisa isn't the only network producing successful telenovelas. TV Azteca and Argos Comunicacin also create top-notch weepers.

Those hilarious/spooky masks aren't just fun to look at, they're a major part of the drama. Removing one from an opponent's head is one of the greatest triumphs and most thrilling moments in lucha libre. Matches are held at Arena Mexico in Mexico City on Tuesdays (7:30 p.m.), Fridays (8:30 p.m.) and Sundays (5 p.m.). Tickets can be purchased from Ticketmaster. MORE: World's 50 best beach bars Polite lies Mexicans' deep fear of appearing rude has given us a bred-in-the-bone aversion to uttering the word "no." Instead -- and unfortunately for those unfamiliar with the rules of courtesy here -- we've developed a talent for white lies that allow us to say yes to fulfilling any request. Even if we can't do anything about it. White lies can be as clichd as "the dog ate my homework" or as morbid as "my beloved great aunt has suddenly developed pancreatic cancer." But the granddaddy of polite lies is "ahorita." "Ahorita" literally means "right now," but it's almost never that. When a Mexican tells you they'll do something "ahorita," be prepared to take a seat, because the wait can be long. Think of ahorita as the Mexican art of procrastination -- it's been passed from generation to generation -- a term that can mean anything from "in 10 minutes" to "in three weeks." Ahorita's cousin in crime is "I'm on my way." This really means, "I'm on my way to finishing this TV show, maybe getting off the couch, calling my sister, taking a shower, grabbing a snack and actually leaving home to meet you."

http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/21/travel/hotel-indoor-pools/index.html	travel	8 irresistible indoor hotel pools - CNN.com	2014/03/21	Friday Mar 21 10:04:11 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- When it comes to hotel pools, the indoor variety has long played second fiddle to their outdoor -- often rooftop -- counterparts. But these days, striking dcor, luxury amenities and stunning settings mean many indoor swimming holes can now challenge even the most glamorous of outdoor pools. And with seasons in tumultuous transition, indoor pools, which are not prey to weather, offer a little bit of an edge. So go ahead and take a dip at these eight luxurious indoor pools. The Water Club at Borgata, Atlantic City This nongaming hotel, which is part of the large Borgata complex in Atlantic City, has three indoor pools (and two more outdoors) so there's really no reason for things to get crowded at any of them. A two-lane lap pool is in the two-floor Immersion spa on the 32nd floor and is set against full-length windows that look out to the Atlantic Ocean, the perfect setup for a water workout. A stunning top-floor pool surrounded by lounge chairs, cabanas and lush foliage telegraphs a more exotic tropical scene than the property's Jersey Shore location. Rooms from $149/night. www.theborgata.com And the world's greatest beach is ... Shangri-La Paris Tucked inside what used to be Napoleon's grandnephew Roland Bonaparte's Parisian home, the 15-by-6-meter, light-bathed pool area (which was previously Bonaparte's stables) extends out to an expansive, plant-lined terrace. All around the pool, which features mosaic tiles inspired to look like Asian carpet, are chic traditional French touches like floral bas relief on the walls and columns surrounding the mezzanine. Rooms from $895/night. www.shangri-la.com Altira Macau On the 16th floor of the tallest building on the island of Taipa is the glamorous indoor infinity pool of the impressively massive gaming complex of Altira Macau. It's easy to see why Forbes once named it one of the best hotel pools in the world: One side faces all of the city with crystal-clear floor-to-ceiling windows. Rooms from $235/night. www.altiramacau.com Hot spots in the world's happiest countries W Verbier, Switzerland W's first ski property is in the heart of the Swiss Alps in the tony town of Verbier. The pool's interior vibe is totally in tune with W's urban aesthetic, with tons of black and leather furnishing that would be right at home at any fabulous pool party. From every corner of the pool, you can look out into the Alps, but if you want a closer vantage point, just swim out into the outdoor area -- the pool is heated -- and breathe in the Alpine air. Rooms from about $1,000/night, double occupancy. www.wverbier.com Tambo del Inka, Peru Tambo del Inka's wellness space's mostly wood, stone and glass construction perfectly marries the property to its natural surroundings in Peru's Sacred Valley. This synergy was the focus of the designers, who used a lot of the local shihuahuaco wood, which grows in the Peruvian rainforest. From the heated pool, you can get glorious views of the Andes, and like W Verbier's setup, you can swim under the partial wall to go from indoor to outdoor. From $455/night. www.libertador.com.pe/en/ Fairmont Le Chteau Montebello, Quebec Built in 1930 for the exclusive private Seigniory Club (which counts international politicians and business tycoons as its members), Le Chteau Montebello's 75-foot-long pool has a real masculine feel, especially because of its log-architecture foundation. The coffered ceiling here adds visual depth to the overall rustic vibe with just a touch of whimsy: The handpainted wooden ceiling is treated to a motif of sea horses and scorpions. The pool has a diving tower, the surrounding area of which has water depth of 12 feet. Rooms from about $175/night. www.fairmont.com The Charles Hotel, Munich One of the largest pools in Munich, at The Charles Hotel, is also one of the most beautiful. The entire spa is outfitted with marble mosaic tiles, mostly in subdued colors punctuated with red flourishes. At the pool itself, a very pretty mosaic of red coral pays homage to 19th century Bavarian royalty, the Wittelsbach family, known for its collection of red coral paraphernalia, from dining cups to jewelry. Rooms from $375/night. www.roccofortehotels.com Waldorf Astoria Chicago The spa at this hotel is done mostly in a stark white, which only further emphasizes the gorgeous rose-design tile-work at the bottom of the pool, giving bathers the feel of swimming over a bed of roses. The 102,600 individually patterned tiles come from Bisazza, an Italian company renowned for its mosaic tile production. Rooms from $345/night. www.waldorfastoriachicagohotel.com  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/27/travel/hotel-traditions/index.html	travel	9 fun U.S. hotel traditions - CNN.com	2014/03/27	Thursday Mar 27 10:10:17 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Lots of hotels have traditions. Nightly happy hours or free check-in snacks aren't that unusual. But the rituals at the U.S. lodgings we've listed here stand out above the crowd in our book, for either their quirkiness or sheer longevity. We think you'll want to join in on the fun. Marco Island Marriott Beach Resort, Golf Club & Spa 
Marco Island, Florida The passing from day to night is also a cause for celebration at this southwest Florida beachfront retreat. Each day at sunset, crowds gather by the beach to watch a spectacle that includes the ritual banging of the gong (with one lucky guest chosen to do the honors), the traditional blowing of the conch shell and then a 15-minute performance by a group of Polynesian fire dancers. What better way to start to wind down after a day of fun in the sun? From $189 per night. www.marcoislandmarriott.com The Peabody  
Memphis, Tennessee Perhaps the most famous hotel tradition of them all is the twice-daily duck parade that waddles through the lobby of this historic downtown Memphis property, as it has for the past 80 years. At 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. each day, five North American mallards depart their palatial rooftop enclosure, hitch a ride on the elevator (under the guidance of the official duck master) and then strut their stuff across a red carpet and into a large marble fountain in the middle of the lobby, where they swim and splash for a bit until it's time to head back to their lofty penthouse. The Peabody's ducks are so famous, they've appeared in everything from an episode of "Jeopardy!" to one of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issues. From $219 per night. www.peabodymemphis.com The Algonquin 
New York This landmark Manhattan lodging also has a resident species its guests have come to know and love: a fetching feline named Matilda. A cat has been a fixture at the Algonquin since a stray wandered into the hotel looking for food and shelter in the 1930s. There have been 10 cats in all, the females all named Matilda and the males all called Hamlet (a moniker that reportedly came from famed actor John Barrymore, who was playing the Shakespearean prince at the time). The current kitty, who was rescued from a local shelter in 2010, is a fluffy, blue-eyed ragdoll who, despite having pretty much the run of the place, often opts to hang out by the front desk, chilling in the lobby's plush chairs and greeting people as they check in. From $269 per night. www.algonquinhotel.com St. Regis Atlanta 
Atlanta The nightly tradition at this upscale Atlanta accommodation certainly has a lot of pop. That's because every day at approximately 6 p.m., either the hotel's wine butler or the general manager holds court outside the Wine Room and ceremoniously sabers a bottle of champagne to help celebrate evening's arrival. The practice of opening a bottle of bubbly with a military-style sword dates to the days of Napoleon and became a ritual here from the moment the doors opened in 2009. Wine master Jennifer Sollinger can even offer tips on how to saber your own bottle using an ordinary chef's knife. From $650 per night. www.stregisatlanta.com Hyatt Regency Lost Pines Resort and Spa 
Lost Pines, Texas Encompassing a 405-acre swath along the banks of the Colorado River just outside Austin, this resort makes full use of the gorgeous Central Texas landscape, presenting guests with the opportunity to participate in everything from kayaking and horseback riding to archery and trap shooting. One of the most popular on-site activities, however, is the weekly meet and greet with the resort's bovine mascots, a pair of longhorn steers named T-Bone and Ribeye. On Sundays from 10 a.m. to noon, guests who wander over to the Riversong Lawn hitching post can saddle up atop the beasts for a unique photo op that makes the perfect Lone Star State souvenir. From $199 per night. www.lostpines.hyatt.com Le Pavillon 
New Orleans The Big Easy may be known for menu items like beignets and jambalaya, but peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are what visitors look forward to at this historic property known affectionately as the Belle of New Orleans. Ever since 1988, when a hungry guest got a late-night hankering for the nostalgic nosh, the hotel has put out a complimentary spread of PB&J sandwiches along with ice-cold milk and toasty hot chocolate. The snacking begins each evening at 10 p.m. From $159 per night. www.lepavillon.com  Griswold Inn 
Essex, Connecticut Speaking of free food, this 238-year-old hotel, which is one of the oldest continuously operated inns in the country, is home to a longstanding but little-known tradition that rewards anyone arriving on horseback or via horse and carriage a gratis lunch at one of its three dining venues. One local resident even has his own time-honored tradition of showing up with horse and buggy for his comp meal every two years after hitting the voting booth on Election Day. From $115 a night. www.griswoldinn.com  Sheraton Maui Resort & Spa 
Lahaina, Hawaii Centuries ago, Hawaiian royalty called this area of Maui home, including Chief Kahekili, who ruled over the land from 1749 to 1794. He was known for mastering the ancient sport of Lele Kawa, which involved jumping feet-first into the ocean from rocky perches up to 400 feet high. In honor of the man known as the King of the Spirit Leap, the Sheraton Maui presents a nightly retelling of his story, which begins with a loincloth-clad warrior lighting torches set at the edge of a lofty promontory and proceeding with a lei offering to the ocean below before taking a daring plunge -- this time headfirst -- into the surf. From $359 per night. www.sheraton-maui.com Westin St. Francis 
San Francisco As a one-of-a-kind amenity for its guests, this luxury property on popular Union Square washes every single coin that makes its way into its coffers. The custom began in 1938, when the general manager decided that all silver coins should be cleaned so as to keep the female guests' white gloves from getting soiled. Arnold Batliner, who was the official coin washer until he retired in the late 1980s, is said to have laundered an estimated $17 million in change throughout his tenure. Today, the job belongs to Rob Holsen, who spends an hour or so each week running the coins through a silver-burnishing machine in a small room behind the registration desk. From $199 a night. www.westinstfrancis.com

Not only are the following places worthy of a December-to-February vacation, some are significantly cheaper. Lech Zrs am Arlberg, Vorarlberg, Austria The small resort of Lech-Zrs is about to get bigger. As of this winter, it'll be connected to nearby Warth-Schrcken by a two-kilometer-long ropeway ski lift, meaning visitors can access 190 kilometers of trails and 47 lifts. The huge range of accommodations runs from five-star Hotel Almhof Schneider, in the shadow of the Schlegelkopf peak, to the quaint and quirky Pension Astoria, a short walk from the town center.

It's located 32 kilometers from the city of Granada. This is the sunniest ski region in Europe, although being located at 2,100 meters (6,889 feet) and with a top station at 3,300 meters (10,826) feet, it's known for being a snow-sure resort -- last winter it opened from November until mid-May.

Skiers who take the chair lift to the top are rewarded with spectacular views and 360-degree skiing off the peak. The development of Grey Mountain gives Red Mountain resort a total of 2,682 ski-able acres, putting it in the top 20 North American ski resorts in terms of terrain size.

With 820 acres spread across eight interconnected mountain peaks, Sunday River is now the second largest ski resort in New England.

A new chairlift will provide advanced skiers with easy access to the challenging Crow's Face and Strawberry Fields areas, previously reached only by hiking. The new lift will also connect Sugar Bowl to the largest cross-country ski resort in North America, Royal Gorge. Sugar Bowl's Lodge is one of the coziest hotels you'll find in a ski resort and is accessed via gondola.

Built in 2008 with an extensive network of wide, groomed runs and childcare facilities, it's a destination for families. It has more than 100 kilometers of ski-able terrain, and its location, in the middle of a forest overlooking the Serre-Ponon lake, makes it one of the more spectacular places to get a winter snow fix. There's not a huge range of accommodation in Les Orres, but La Portette has 26 spacious bedrooms, direct access to the piste and stunning mountain views.

Although small, the resort has something for snowboarders and skiers of all abilities: there are five green runs, 34 blue slopes, 26 red runs and six black slopes. Catalonia is one of the few places in Europe where heli-skiing is legal and there are some fantastic back-country areas. In 2014, the resort will be holding various events to mark its 50th anniversary. Accommodation includes luxury offerings such as the five-star Val de Neu hotel (a favorite with the Spanish royal family) or more affordable Melia Royal Tanau, a stylish, slope-side hotel.

Ischgl is already the biggest interconnected ski area in Tyrol, with more than 238 kilometers of runs. Accommodation in Ischgl includes a number of hotels within meters of the centrally located Silvretta cable car.

Accommodations include the Slopeside Condominiums on the edge of the resort. With a new indoor water park, the Hotel Jay and Conference Center is suitable for families.

There are no nightclubs or bars, just lots of snow -- by mid-season there are usually around four meters. It's a four-hour train ride from Tokyo. The resort, Japan's oldest, dating to 1911, is surrounded by an astounding 25 ski areas. Like most Japanese resorts, Myoko Kogen offers traditional and Western accommodation.

This winter a new cable car will connect Arosa with the nearby resort of Lenzerheide.

In Bettmeralp, Hotel Alpfrieden is a beautiful, stone-clad hotel, loved by return guests for its extensive wine list. The Art Furrer hotel in Riederalp is centrally located and just a short walk from the ski school. Switzerland's famous ski train means the resort is equally well connected to Bern, Basel and Zurich.

An hour drive from Salzburg, the town dates to medieval times and is packed with small, family-run cafes, shops and aprs-ski bars. One of the most beautiful hotels is the Hotel Schtterhof.

But there's no need to despair or settle for some landlocked compromise. We've pinpointed affordable island hotels that span the globe, from destinations usually reserved for big spenders to others barely on the radar of most travelers. All of our favorites have room rates that start below $200some as low as $70. And these hotels have more going for them than price point, whether it's an oceanfront location or cozy charm. Whatever your idea of paradise, we think you'll agree that every gem on our list deserves treasure island status. Lefkes Village Hotel, Paros, Greece Part of the Cyclades, Paros delivers all the archetypal Greek island drawswhitewashed churches, bougainvillea-festooned houses, panoramic Aegean viewswithout the high prices of neighboring hot spots Santorini and Mykonos. Case in point: this 20-room contemporary hotel in the quiet mountain village of Lefkes, with a swimming pool, a small museum, and a tavern that uses ingredients gathered from the surrounding fruit trees and gardens. From $70. La Veranda Resort, Vietnam The island of Phu Quoc (the country's largest) is firmly on the tourist radar these days, yet it still retains the serene small-town essence that first drew intrepid travelers to its balmy shores. This elegant two-story resort radiates French colonial-era charm: airy rooms with net-draped beds with either lush tropical garden or ocean views, a dining room serving Pan Pacific cuisine on a long veranda beneath lazy ceiling fans, and a clubby lounge bar with scarlet walls. From $140. Travel + Leisure: Best U.S. cities for affordable getaways Copamarina Beach Resort & Spa, Puerto Rico Copamarina occupies prime oceanfront real estate on Puerto Rico's less-explored southern coast, complete with a palm-fringed beach and 20 acres of tropical gardens. It's a setting that more than makes up for any style shortcomings. Take advantage of the recently updated on-site spa, two seafood-oriented restaurants, and several pools, or venture farther afield. The historic seaside town of Gunica is within walking distance; nearby adventures include bird-watching in Dry Forest Reserve and snorkeling by tiny Gilligan's Island. From $145. Fairbanks House, Amelia Island, Florida Amelia Island combines the Spanish moss-draped romance of the South with a laid-back tropical ambience. And this boutique Italianate-style villa is the perfect base from which to take it all in. The historic building (est. 1885) displays all manner of over-the-top details: dormers, bay windows, massive chimneys, balustraded balconies, and a 15-foot tower. Rooms feature canopy or four-poster beds, fireplaces, and bathrooms that will thrill any nostalgics yearning to soak in a Victorian-era claw-foot tub. From $180. Travel + Leisure: Best affordable all-inclusive resorts Fishers' Loft, Newfoundland, Canada Overlooking Trinity Bay and the harbor of Ship Cove, Fishers' Loft is found on one of Atlantic Canada's most fascinating, idiosyncratic islands. Designed in the clapboard-and-shingles style of the late 1800s, this cozy inn evokes Newfoundland's seafaring past; guests have the chance to spot whales and icebergs out the mullioned windows, depending on the season. Meals are sourced with ingredients gathered from the inn's greenhouse and gardens. From $99. Auberge Seraphine, St. Lucia A big hit with honeymooners, the lush Caribbean island of St. Lucia can also take a big hit on your wallet, thanks to its slew of high-end resorts. Not so at this sweet family-run hotel near Castries on the northwest coast. There's no beach here, but the auberge has a lovely pool and is on sailboat-packed Vielle Bay, close to a large lily pad--filled pond popular with hundreds of white egrets. Snag a table at the on-site restaurant for seafood risotto and lobster. From $125. Rosario Resort & Spa, Orcas Island, Washington For an island getaway with a dose of history, consider this quaint 40-acre resort on the largest of Washington State's San Juan Islands, overlooking East Sound and Cascade Bay. Rosario shares land with Moran Mansion, the magnificent former home of shipbuilder and onetime Seattle mayor Robert Moran. It's now a museum featuring archival photographs, model ships, and an impressive collection of Arts and Crafts furnishings amassed by Moran. From $99. Travel + Leisure: Best places to spend Christmas Villa Serena, Dominican Republic Word has spread about the Saman peninsula, an unspoiled stretch of coastline in the island's northeast corner, far from the madding crowds of the Puerto Cana resort region. Part of the peninsula's appeal is its bevy of stylish small hotels, among them, Villa Serena on Las Galeras Bay. It has all the classic Caribbean colonial features -- Palladian arches, wooden shutters, acres of white gingerbread trimset in sprawling tropical gardens just steps from the sand. Daily alfresco yoga sessions overlooking the ocean are a highlight. From $110. Sangat Island Dive Resort, Palawan, Philippines It's not hard to understand why T+L readers voted Palawan their favorite island in the 2013 World's Best survey; the lightly populated archipelago shows off the sublime underwater richness of the Philippines. After diving or snorkeling in the surrounding coral reef, retreat back to your cottage at this low-key resort at the foot of towering limestone cliffs. Simple tropical furnishingsbamboo floors and walls, bright textiles, and terraces slung with hammockskeep the focus on the outrageously beautiful ocean views. From $85. La Tosca, Capri, Italy Dreams are made of this: a charming family-run hotel in one of Italy's most upscale destinations for around $100 a night. Whitewashed La Tosca also occupies a lofty position, providing glimpses of the Faraglioni rocks from the breakfast terrace.

http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/24/travel/industrial-chic-hotels/index.html	travel	7 cool industrial-chic hotels - CNN.com	2013/12/24	Tuesday Dec 24 09:54:47 EST 2013	(CNN) -- While there's plenty to be said in favor of the new, sometimes the best things stem from a solid original foundation. Industrial structures like warehouses and factories are finding new incarnations as luxury hotels, challenging designers to get creative with old bones and drawing in guests who seek a sense of history and character. In New York, the Wythe Hotel (Brooklyn) and the Refinery Hotel (Manhattan) were resurrected from a cooperage and a hat factory respectively. In Istanbul, the brand-new Shangri-La Bosphorus brings opulence to the banks of the river in the form of elegant rooms converted from a former tobacco warehouse. And the remote Fabriken Furillen, once a limestone refinery, is an isolated 16-room property on a Swedish island, where neighbors are few but the scenery is stunning. Here are seven cutting-edge hotels that come from humble origins. Your most spectacular travel photos 1888 Hotel, Sydney One of Sydney's trendiest accommodations, 1888 Hotel opened its doors in July, welcoming guests to its 90-room boutique property in the Pyrmont neighborhood. The guest rooms feature 10-foot ceilings; windows and desks constructed from recycled timber; and a lobby, an atrium and a bar studded with reclaimed wooden beams and exposed brick. Despite the vintage details, the five-story hotel takes a modern approach to technology: Each room comes with an iPad and Instagram users with more than 10,000 followers are entitled to one complimentary night's stay. The staff wears denim work shirts in a cheeky nod to the heritage-listed building's previous life as a woolshed. Rooms start at $150; 139 Murray St.; 61-2/8586-1888; 8hotels.com. Fabriken Furillen, Gotland, Sweden While most former industrial buildings are found in ports or in cities, Fabriken Furillen is a rural outlier on the island of Gotland, off Sweden's southeastern coast. Once a limestone refinery, the 18-room hotel (including two cabins) is a haven of sharp-edged Scandinavian design in a stunningly scenic -- almost lunar -- setting. Rooms are painted in white or gray and feature luxury beds, Bang & Olufsen technology (some rooms have televisions, others have radios; the cabins are electronics-free) and bucolic touches like sheepskin rugs and blankets made from Gotland wool. The restaurant serves simple, elegant meals made with island-grown vegetables and herbs. Rooms start at $315; Rute Furillen, 624 58 Lrbro; 46-498/223-040; furillen.com. Top U.S. spots to visit in 2014 Wythe Hotel, Brooklyn, New York Brooklyn is home to plenty of reclaimed industrial spaces, but the Wythe Hotel is one of the newest (it opened in May 2012) and chicest. Floor-to-ceiling windows in many rooms look straight out onto the Manhattan skyline over the East River, letting in copious amounts of sunlight to play off the exposed-brick walls and custom-made wallpaper. Original cast-iron columns, masonry and 13-foot-high timber ceilings speak to the building's history as a cooperage. The concrete floors are heated (a detail the former tenants might have appreciated as they rolled out barrels on the Williamsburg waterfront); the furniture (beds were constructed from pine taken from the ceilings) and artwork is made locally. Rooms start at $180; 80 Wythe Ave.; 718-460-8000; wythehotel.com. Refinery Hotel, New York A century-old neo-Gothic building in the heart of New York's Garment District, the Refinery started out as a millinery factory. It is now an elegant, eclectic 12-story hotel with amazing structural features and plenty of luxurious amenities. Opened in May 2013, it features lobby details (a 72-foot custom-designed runner, vaulted ceilings, plaid-patterened finished-walnut walls) that evoke an old New York feel. In the rooms, steel-and-leather headboards reinforce the industrial ambiance, while wooden bedside lockers add a touch of nostalgia. On occasion the hotel's loading dock becomes Hatbox, a gallery space hosting art exhibits and fashion shows. Rooms start at $460; 63 W. 38th St.; 646-664-0310; refineryhotelnewyork.com. Departures: World's best design hotels Sir Albert, Amsterdam Though Sir Albert may have a fictional host at its helm (the gentleman of its name is a made-up character), the hotel has a very real former life as a 19th-century diamond factory. Despite the space's original connection to gems, the decor has a distinctly masculine feel, thanks to brown curtains, dark wood furniture in the guest rooms and cowskin-patterned cubes for sitting in the study -- a cozy public space with deep leather armchairs and well-stocked bookshelves. Plenty of bright northern sunshine streams in through the high windows in most rooms, which harkens back to the legacy of the diamond workers, who needed the best possible light to practice their craft. Rooms start at $270; Albert Cuypstraat 2-6; 31-20/305-3020; siralberthotel.com. Departures: High-design airport terminals Waterhouse, Shanghai Formerly a dockyard warehouse on the Huangpu River, Waterhouse is now a high-design hotel. While plenty of its earliest features have been preserved -- the window frames are original metal and the wall behind the reception desk looks positively ancient -- the refurbished concept (by the lavishly praised Neri & Hu Design and Research Office) is a modern masterpiece. Playing with conventions of internal and external spaces, the design allows guests to peek into private quarters from public areas and vice versa. Gloriously sleek and minimalist, the 19 rooms contrast nicely with views onto the neon-lit Bund, which is crammed with unconventionally shaped skyscrapers. Rooms start at $195; Maojiayuan Road 1-3, Huangpu District; 86-21/6080-2988; waterhouseshanghai.com. Departures: Spectacular casino hotels Shangri-La Bosphorus, Istanbul Originally a tobacco warehouse in the 1930s, this Shangri-La property opened in May 2013 with the largest guestrooms in Istanbul. Situated on the European side of the city, with many rooms overlooking the Bosphorus Strait, the hotel pays homage to the opulence of its Bosphorus neighbor, Dolmabahe Palace. Chandeliers glitter, specially commissioned artwork dazzles, and Turkish-marble bathrooms come stocked with Bulgari bath products. The hotel's architects even restored the Neoclassical faade of the original warehouse. For unparalleled views, check out the Shangri-La Suite, which has three private terraces and overlooks the Old City (the Asian bank of the strait) and the Bosphorus Bridge. Rooms start at $740; Sinanpasa Mah, Hayrettin Iskelesi Sok, No.1, Besiktas; 90-212/275-8888; shangri-la.com. See more industrial-chic hotels   2010 American Express Publishing Corporation.

This latest effort can be found off an African island and straightaway is placed high on that list of 'amazing hotels I wish i could get to' many travelers have. Just off the coast of Tanzania, The Manta Resort on Pemba Island has added a beautiful, other-worldly underwater bedroom to their original 16-room offering. The new 'digs' opened for business this month, designed by Swedish company Genberg Underwater Hotels. They are the brains behind the The Utter Inn, an underwater room in the middle of a Swedish lake which was also one of our 15 unusual places to spend the night. Lying approximately 250 meters offshore, the latest underwater structure is a three-story affair, with a rooftop deck, a bathroom and a lounge area at sea level and finally the bedroom downstairs, with the fish. At night, spotlights under the windows attract and illuminate squid and octopus -- a more reclusive crowd than the daytime sea life. The resort is popular with divers owing to the coral reef around the island.

For the cost of a night's stay you can, at these landmark estate hotels that were once the posh private residences of wealthy politicians, cotton barons and the like. Here are eight magnificent mansion hotels across the United States that were once home sweet home. The Chanler at Cliff Walk 
Newport, Rhode Island New York Congressman John Winthrop Chanler and his wife Margaret Astor Ward's 1873 home was the first to be built on what is now the famed Cliff Walk that runs along Newport's eastern shoreline. Having hosted dignitaries like Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and President Theodore Roosevelt over the years, its rooms are now open to anyone who wants to experience its Gilded Age grandeur. Each of the 20 guest rooms captures a different theme or historical period, including English Tudor and Empire. From $229 per night. www.thechanler.com Wentworth Mansion 
Charleston, South Carolina Dating to 1886, this 21-room, four-story property in historic downtown Charleston was built for wealthy Southern cotton merchant Francis Silas Rodgers, his wife and their 13 children. Though it's been totally restored, guests will see many of the original details installed by architect Daniel G. Wayne, including Tiffany stained glass, pressed tin ceilings, crystal chandeliers and carved marble mantles. The former stables now serve as the hotel's 1,000-square-foot spa, and the one-time carriage house has been converted into its four-star dining room. From $390 per night. www.wentworthmansion.com Vacancy: 10 abandoned hotels Castle Hotel & Spa 
Tarrytown, New York Head 30 minutes north of Manhattan and you'll come across this historic property that was once the residence of noted newspaperman and playwright General Howard Carroll. Carrollclifffe, as it was called upon completion in 1910, featured 45 rooms and was modeled after medieval fortifications in Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Though totally refurbished in early 2013, the integrity and Old World ambiance remain, visible in details like the intricately carved wooden stairways, hand-hewn oak beams and leaded-glass windows. For the full-on castle experience, reserve one of the tower suites, complete with wood-burning fireplace and turret alcove. From $320 per night. www.castlehotelandspa.com Keswick Hall at Monticello 
Keswick, Virginia You'd never know it today, but the estate's historic 1912 wing, originally christened Villa Crawford for its first owner, fell into serious decay and was boarded up for many years. That is until 1990, when Sir Bernard Ashley (the widower of famed designer Laura Ashley) bought the 600-acre manor with the intention of turning it into a "country house hotel" fit for a king. His subsequent $25 million makeover both modernized and upgraded the property, while maintaining its fundamental structure and design, and then he added antiques and artworks throughout from his own private collection. From $495 per night. www.keswick.com 8 very old sites in the New World Dolce Hayes Mansion 
San Jose, California Flush with riches from iron ore mining enterprises in Michigan and Wisconsin, Mary Hayes Chynoweth and her two sons had this expansive Mediterranean triple residence built in the early 1900s. The City of San Jose purchased the manse in 1985 and later turned it into a conference center, adding the 214 guestrooms now available for nightly guests. Take the self-guided walking tour of the property (pamphlets are available) and you'll spy historic photos and visit various rooms where the family once dined, entertained, slept and attended daily worship services. From $149 per night. www.hayesmansion.com Castle Hill Resort and Spa 
Cavendish, Vermont This lavish English Cotswold-style estate nestled amid the verdant Green Mountains was once the home of Allen Miller Fletcher, who, among other accomplishments, served as governor of Vermont from 1912 to 1915. It was not only the first home in the state to be fully wired for electricity, but also the first to boast its own elevator. Guests who check in here will see many of the property's other authentic design features, from the wallpaper in the staircase that dates back to 1905 to the gneiss stone that was quarried onsite to construct the exterior. From $279 per night. www.castlehillresort.com  Wilburton Inn 
Manchester Village, Vermont About an hour southwest of the Castle Hill Resort and Spa is another mansion hotel, the Wilburton Inn. Sitting atop a hill on a plot of land rumored to have been won in a high-stakes poker game, the building was completed in 1902, as the country estate of Chicago industrialist and railroad manufacturer Albert M. Gilbert. Several owners and reincarnations later, the property now serves as a quaint and cozy retreat for travelers visiting this popular summer vacation destination. Current proprietor Melissa Levis claims it's so magical here, they give guests magic wands when they check in. From $195 a night. www.wilburton.com Cranwell Resort, Spa and Golf Club 
Lenox, Massachusetts The Berkshires. The name conjures up flannel-clad weekends spent antiquing and cross-country skiing. And there's no better place to serve as your home base than this 380-acre resort that was once the Wyndhurst Mansion, built in 1894 for John W. Sloane, a relative of the Vanderbilts and owner of the furnishings house W. & J. Sloane. Sloane commissioned premier architecture firm Peabody & Sterns to design the "cottage" itself (cottages at that time were defined as secondary residences with a minimum of 30 rooms and 20 acres), and put Frederick Olmstead, the landscape architect behind Central Park, in charge of the gardens.

http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/16/travel/downton-abbey-us-style/index.html	travel	'Downton' in America: 6 big estates - CNN.com	2013/02/16	Saturday Feb 16 11:05:44 EST 2013	(CNN) -- Few of us can imagine living the opulent "Downton Abbey" lives of the fictional Crawley family at the turn of the 20th century. There were servants to address one's every material need, dinner in white tie and lavish gowns, and rules designed to keep the upper crust on top and the lower classes in their place. You almost have to see the sprawling estate to believe that the lifestyle existed, yet the trip to visit Highclere Castle, the estate used by the television show in rural England, may cost more than the less well-to-do American can afford. There's no need to cross the pond to get a taste of that life. Although the United States did not have lords or ladies living on grand estates, there were American millionaires who made their fortunes by harnessing the resources of a new country. With an eye to the style of their European counterparts, they built mansions on extensive grounds to show off their power and wealth. So if you're entering a period of "Downton" withdrawal, consider a peek into America's historic high life. The places where masterpieces are born "These homes represented the creation of immense wealth at the turn of the century in the United States, the kind of wealth acquired through fundamental commodities like water, gold, oil and food," said Katherine Malone-France, the National Trust for Historic Preservation's historic sites director of outreach, education and support. "These estates represented the taste and sophistication of their owners, as well as the skills and labors of those who built them and worked in them. These places were icons then and now, and they make for great television and fantastic places to visit as historic sites, because they contain all of those complex, compelling and interwoven stories." The new American wealthy didn't have hundreds of years to build their fancy homes and reputations, yet the Vanderbilts, Rockefellers and other wealthy families built houses to last for generations. These are just a handful of the homes where they were living large around the same time as the "Downton Abbey" story lines. Downton Abbey creates tourism boom The Rockefellers: Hudson Valley, New York With the economic engine that is New York nearby, it makes sense that the country's new wealthy would build their homes and country homes in the city's suburbs and nearby Hudson Valley. The Vanderbilts, Roosevelts and Goulds all had homes in the area. Completed in 1913, Kykuit was the home of Standard Oil founder and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller and the next three generations of his family. The six-story home, now a National Trust for Historic Preservation property operated by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, is open to the public for tours. Make sure to tour the gardens to see New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller's 20th-century sculpture collection, including the works of Alexander Calder, Henry Moore and Pablo Picasso. Kykuit's elaborate gardens also feature classical sculpture, pavilions, fountains and Hudson River views. The Douglas family: Cedar Rapids, Iowa Like the fictional Crawleys, the Douglas family was touched by the sinking of the Titanic. Although the Brucemore estate was built for wealthy widow Caroline Sinclair and her six children in 1886, the Sinclair family lived there just 20 years. The George and Irene Douglas family and its descendants, known for Douglas & Co. and Quaker Oats, lived there from 1906 to 1981. It was George's brother Walter who perished on the Titanic. Reports say his wife, Mahala, asked him to join her on a lifeboat. He replied, "No, I must be a gentleman" and went to join a group of men waiting for later lifeboats. His body was recovered later and identified by his monogrammed shirt. Visitors can tour the 21-room Queen Anne style mansion and grounds. The Booths: Bloomfield Hills, Michigan The Canadian-born owner of an ironworks company, George Booth settled in Detroit when he married Ellen Warren Scripps, the daughter of the founder of the Detroit News. The Booths purchased a rundown farm in Bloomfield Hills to turn into their summer home and eventually built a new year-round home, Cranbrook House, which was completed in 1908. George Booth became a leading patron of the American Arts and Crafts movement in the early 20th century, and it showed in the designs he chose for his home and the art he collected. The couple also started six education and arts institutions on their property, including the famous Cranbrook Academy of Art. While still alive, they deeded the house, much of its contents and the surrounding property to the Cranbrook Foundation they created, living the rest of their lives not as owners but under a life trust at Cranbrook House. It is the oldest surviving manor home in the metro Detroit area. The Vanderbilts: Asheville, North Carolina George Vanderbilt didn't care for the city life as much as the rest of his family. So it was no surprise that after he visited the mountains of North Carolina, he eventually built his 250-room estate in Asheville. The Biltmore was completed in 1895, when he was still single. Vanderbilt married Edith Stuyvesant Dresser in Paris in 1898, and the couple raised their only child at Biltmore. Descendants of the Vanderbilts still own and operate the estate as a for-profit company, and the home is now open to the public for tours. There's a 10,000-volume library, a bowling alley, a banquet hall featuring a 70-foot ceiling, an indoor pool and the artwork of Pierre Auguste Renoir and John Singer Sargent, among others. Architect Richard Morris Hunt modeled the house after three 16th-century French chateaux. With more than 30 bedrooms, it's still shy of the 50 plus bedrooms at Downton's Highclere Castle. Still, Biltmore seems more than adequate for a house party. Don't miss the butler's tour if you want to see how the other half lived on the estate. Modern guests can stay at an inn built in 2001 or a historic cottage that once served as the gardener's house. The Bourns: Woodside, California Filoli was completed in 1917 as the country estate for Mr. and Mrs. William Bowers Bourn, San Franciscans whose money came from water and gold. Filoli is just 30 miles outside San Francisco. The European influence can be found all over the property: Tuscan columns in the portico, art from the Bourns' travels to Europe and even some of the house's walls. (The house library was copied from the library at Denham Place, a 1690s home in England.) The expansive formal gardens were designed and constructed between 1917 and 1929. The next owners lived in the house until 1975, when the house and formal gardens were donated to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The Berwinds: Newport, Rhode Island Downton fans might remember that the mother of American-born Cora, the countess of Grantham, had a home in Newport. That's where rich Americans summered, and it's where visitors can tour several grand homes at a time. Mr. and Mrs. Edward Julius Berwind, who made their money in coal mining, built the Elms as their summer residence in Newport. Now one of the famous Newport Mansions and a National Historic Landmark, the Elms was finished in 1901. Unlike some residents of fictional Downton, who grudgingly adapted to modern conveniences like telephones and electricity, the Berwinds had the Elms outfitted with the latest modern conveniences. The house was among the first in Newport to be fully electrified with no gas backup. There was even an early ice maker. The couple's art collection featured 18th-century Venetian and French paintings and Renaissance ceramics. To get a good sense of life among the servants, the Preservation Society of Newport County, which owns and operates 10 historic properties in Newport, added an Elms servant life tour last year.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/05/travel/air-force-museum-spy-plane/index.html	travel	Area 51 spy plane and other aviation tales - CNN.com	2014/02/05	Wednesday Feb 5 08:20:26 EST 2014	Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio (CNN) -- It looks like an upside-down bathtub with wings, pretty odd for a spy jet that was among the nation's most highly classified pieces of military hardware. As I stand in front of the plane code-named Tacit Blue at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force, near Dayton, Ohio, I'm reminded that it still holds a bit of mystery. Engineers made fun of Tacit Blue's design by nicknaming it the Whale, but the program -- declassified in 1996 -- was deadly serious. It was all about stealth. Pentagon Cold War strategists desperately wanted to build planes that could evade Soviet radar. And so the Air Force launched a "black program" to develop Tacit Blue and tested it at a secret government airbase in Nevada called "Area 51," according to CIA documents released in 2013. The program, which lasted from 1978 to 1985, aimed to develop a single-seater jet for battlefield surveillance. Before last year's document release, the government never acknowledged the existence of Area 51. For decades, a fenced-off area surrounding Nevada's Groom Lake was rumored to be a testing ground for some of the nation's most secret technology. Two retired Air Force test pilots who flew Tacit Blue in the early 1980s, Ken Dyson and Russ Easter, spoke about why this plane was important and what set it apart. Although the plane flew 135 times and was never put into production, without Tacit Blue, there would have been no B-2 Spirit bomber. The plane proved that aircraft with curved surfaces could evade radar. "The airplane flew pretty solid, I'd say," Dyson remembered. Could sightings of Tacit Blue have contributed to UFO reports? "I'm not aware of any circumstance like that," Easter said. Dyson also says no. But Cynda Thomas, widow of the first Tacit Blue test pilot Richard G. "Dick" Thomas, said she was with her husband in Los Angeles when an airline pilot accosted her husband during a test pilots' banquet at the Beverly Hilton. As she remembers it, "The pilot came over, and he said, 'Mr. Thomas, I'm so-and-so, and I fly for Continental, and I'm sure I saw you flying the Tacit Blue -- and you know, I reported you as a UFO.' " "Airline pilots have, over the past, reported some stuff that could have been black aircraft in flight tests," Dyson said. "One and a half" Tacit Blue planes were built, Dyson said, so that "if we lost one, we could have a second one up and flying in short order." What happened to the other half of Tacit Blue? "I think it was done away with -- with total respect to secrecy." Mechanical remnants from a related black program called Have Blue "are buried at Groom Lake," according to a 2011 Air Force report. Groom Lake is inside Area 51, according to those released CIA documents. "I don't know anything at all about that Have Blue stuff and wouldn't answer it if I did," said Dyson, who also tested Have Blue airplanes. Dyson is aware of the CIA documents but said he didn't want to talk about Groom Lake or Area 51 or to even mention those places by name. "That's just because of the secrecy that was drilled into me," he said. Maintaining Tacit Blue's secrets and preventing leaks, Dyson said, was proof of the success of a tightly knit and dedicated team. Pursuing a career centered around a secret job takes discipline. "My wife had no clue what I was doing for a long time," Dyson said. "I just didn't talk about it to her or to anyone else who wasn't cleared on the program. It just wasn't done." Richard Thomas also kept details about his work from his family, Cynda Thomas said, although in 1978 he did reveal to her that he was "going into the black world." Secrecy made professional relationships complicated at times. Associates outside Dyson's and Easter's secret circle wanted to hear "war stories" about what it was like to work in the world of black programs, Easter said. "Sometimes I wish we could tell more stories more freely so that some of the lessons learned could be passed on freer." 50 states, 50 spots to visit in 2014 Three unique things about Tacit Blue  Pantyhose made it safer: According to Cynda Thomas' book "Hell of a Ride," an air compressor was blowing tiny flammable aluminum shavings through inlet pipes and into the cockpit, creating a fire hazard. The engineers' unorthodox solution: cover the inlet pipes with filters made of pantyhose, Thomas wrote. "That could be true," Easter acknowledges.  They created an artificial wind tunnel with a huge transport aircraft. Developers used a huge C-130 Hercules plane to create artificial winds that hit the side of the plane so they could test Tacit Blue's performance. Dyson described it as a sort of "wind tunnel" that was set up "in the black of the night so no one could see us flying overhead with a satellite."  It was very hard to pilot: Tacit Blue at the time was "arguably the most unstable aircraft man had ever flown," ex-Northrop engineer John Cashen told Air Force Magazine. Richard Thomas died in 2006, at age 76. Cynda Thomas said her husband had been battling Parkinson's disease. At Tacit Blue's 1996 unveiling ceremony at the museum, Thomas was able to sit inside the airplane's cockpit one more time. "That's when they let me point my camera up the steps of the airplane to take his picture," recalls Cynda Thomas. "I'm so thankful he got to do that before he passed. That plane was my husband's legacy." 8 very old sites in the New World The plane that wouldn't quit: 'Spare 617' Outside the museum's doors, at the Air Park, sit several giant planes -- each with their own stories. One of them, the Air Force Museum says, saw "one of the greatest feats of airmanship of the Southeast Asia War." In April 1972, a huge C130-E Hercules transport plane code-named Spare 617 was ordered to fly over a raging battle in South Vietnam and parachute-drop giant pallets of ammunition. If all went well, the ammo would resupply South Vietnamese soldiers fighting on the ground. But all did not go well. Preparing to make his drop, pilot William Caldwell flew the plane low over the town of An Loc. But the enemy had put a machine gun nest high above the town in a church steeple, Caldwell recalled. "So, we were just a sitting duck for him." Caldwell remembers machine gun fire ripping through the cockpit, smashing a circuit breaker panel and the plane's windows. Flight engineer Jon Sanders died instantly. The attack wounded copilot John Hering and navigator Richard Lenz and damaged two of the plane's four turboprop engines. Gunfire ruptured a duct designed to bleed hot air from the plane's powerful engines. The scalding air severely burned cargo loadmaster Charlie Shaub, as Caldwell put it, like a "600-degree hurricane." Then it got worse. The attack set fire to some of the plane's explosive cargo. But despite his burns, Shaub was somehow able to eject the burning pallets of ammunition. It was just in time. Seconds later, the ammo exploded as it fell to the ground. Then, Shaub astonishingly snuffed out the fire in the cargo hold. Caldwell closed the bleed air duct and shut down the damaged engines. Next problem: how to save the wounded crew. Caldwell pointed the plane toward an air base with the best medical facilities. He would have to land a giant C-130E with only two working engines -- both on the same side of the aircraft. Things looked grim, he said, but "I got more confident with every mile we got closer to the air base," said Caldwell. Again, things went further south. A hydraulics system that was needed to lower the landing gear became useless. Using nothing but sheer muscle, Lenz and cargo loadmaster Dave McAleece lowered the wheels by hand using crank handles, Caldwell said. Caldwell landed the plane fast: pushing about 170 mph. With hydraulics busted, he had trouble steering the plane. "I used the inboard right side engine to guide the plane down a high-speed runway turnoff," he said. After rolling to a stop, "I got out of the airplane," Caldwell recalled. An airman on the ground asked, "Are you OK?" Caldwell replied, "You bastards didn't prepare us for THIS." Blood Falls and other natural oddities Three notable details about the mission  What recognition did the crew receive? Caldwell and Shaub received the Air Force Cross, the Air Force's second-highest award for valor.  Did the plane have any weapons? Spare 617 flew with virtually no defensive weaponry. "We only had .38 revolvers," said Caldwell, 70, now a retired colonel who teaches aviation management at Southern Illinois University. It was the airplane itself, he said, that helped save them. "That airplane was just as responsible for getting us home as any of the crew."  How hard was it to lower the landing gear? The attack knocked out the plane's hydraulic system, forcing the crew to lower the plane's gigantic landing gear manually. "I think it takes roughly 650 turns of that crank to get a landing gear down on both sides of the airplane. It's an endurance thing more than strength thing." 'Angel' of freedom: The Hanoi Taxi A third piece of flying history at the museum has come to symbolize freedom for former U.S. POWs captured during the Vietnam War. They call it the Hanoi Taxi, the first U.S. plane to ferry newly freed troops out of North Vietnam. Photos of the ex-captives taken aboard the C-141 Starlifter clearly illustrate the joy and relief the men felt that day in February 1973. Until the POWs left enemy airspace, they had refused to give their captors the satisfaction of showing happiness for being released. When they crossed over international waters, stoic silence immediately turned to joyful pandemonium. A few hours later, with the Starlifter in the background, TV viewers watched stunning, emotional reunions in the Philippines between the ex-POWs and their loved ones. Maj. Gen. Edward Mechenbier, a retired Air Force fighter pilot who spent nearly six years as a North Vietnamese prisoner, rode aboard the plane as it carried him back to the United States from the Philippines. "This plane looked like an absolute angel coming to get us," he remembered. Now, the plane sits at the museum's Air Park, at the mercy of the wind and cold. Walking around the aircraft and running your hand across its metal exterior, you get a sense that you're touching a piece of history. "It's a hallowed place," said museum curator Jeff Duford. "And you can definitely get a sense of that when you step aboard it." But right now, that's not possible for visitors. The Taxi's interior is off-limits, and its flight deck windows are covered. The plane -- along with Spare 617 -- is slated to be housed in a new $35.4 million building in 2016. Duford says the museum hasn't decided whether visitors will be able to board either aircraft when they move inside. The Hanoi Taxi flew two freedom missions carrying ex-POWs out of Hanoi's Gia Lam Airport. Overall, the aircraft's total passengers to freedom numbered 78 POWs and two civilian returnees. The plane also flew four freedom missions from the Philippines to the United States, carrying a total of 76 ex-POWs. For four decades, the airplane served around the world, until it retired in 2006 to the Air Force museum. Three unique things about the Hanoi Taxi  The plane returned to Vietnam in 2004: Mechenbier, by then a major general, flew the Hanoi Taxi back to Vietnam on a mission to repatriate the newly recovered remains of two U.S. service members who were killed in action during the war.  It served in the Iraq War: The plane helped transfer wounded troops from Baghdad to Ramstein Air Base in Germany and to Washington for treatment at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.  It served as a disaster evacuation plane: The Hanoi Taxi airlifted survivors to safety after 2005's Hurricane Katrina. Like many of the museum's other hundreds of aircraft, these three planes -- Tacit Blue, Spare 617 and the Hanoi Taxi -- contributed to history. "These really aren't airplanes anymore," Duford said. "They're artifacts. And so we want to make sure, as a responsible institution, that we protect those artifacts. That's more important than anything else."  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/26/travel/boeing-aviation-geek-factory-tour/index.html	travel	Aviation geeks tour Boeing factory for 747s, 777s and 787s. - CNN.com	2014/02/26	Wednesday Feb 26 07:53:40 EST 2014	Everett, Washington (CNN) -- Sprawled out before us sits the exterior of the world's biggest building by volume. They make airliners here. Big ones. "Let's go see some airplanes!" says our Boeing VIP tour guide. I remind myself: This doesn't happen very often. Yeah yeah yeah, Boeing offers public tours of this 98.3-acre airliner factory north of Seattle every day. This ain't that. This is special. As part of a convention of aviation fans called Aviation Geek Fest, we're gaining ultra-exclusive access to the factory FLOOR. The public tour is limited to the balcony. We're about to walk knee-deep where Boeing gives birth to some of the world's biggest and most advanced airliners, including the 747-8 Intercontinental, the 777 Worldliner and the 787 Dreamliner. Hot damn. But not so fast -- before we go inside, Boeing has laid down some rules: no photos, no video, for our eyes only. Here's a painful development: Our smartphones have been confiscated. Gulp. I'm already suffering from phantom phone pangs. We enter through a small, inconspicuous door marked S-1. Suddenly, we're surrounded by partly assembled airliners in a room so big it takes on the feeling of an entire world. In some spots, we gaze across an unobstructed view measuring a quarter-mile. This building is so flippin' big that -- years ago -- it created its own inside weather patterns, including vapor clouds. They eliminated that by installing a special ventilation system. Today's factory forecast: avgeeking, with continued avgeeking and a favorable chance of avgeeking later in the day. Here are a few cool tidbits: Jaw-dropping perspective The thrill of being so close to the planes literally stops you in your tracks. Seemingly everywhere you look there's another five- or six-story-tall airplane towering over you. Some are covered with a green, protective temporary coating. One Dreamliner tail is painted with the familiar British Airways red, white and blue. Another sports New Zealand Air's cool black-and-white. Boeing paints the tails before they're attached to the planes. Then they carefully adjust the tails for balance. Paint adds hundreds of pounds of weight, which would ruin the plane's balance if the tails were painted after being attached. Soon these behemoths will jet across vast oceans as they carry travelers to far-flung destinations. 'You've gotta have secret clearance' The planes' huge fuselages are joined together with the help of a giant piece of equipment called a "saddle." This U-shaped metal cage straddles the top of the planes during the body-joining process. The "Wing Build" area -- where workers attach wings to the planes -- is the loudest part of the entire facility. The staccato of rivet guns pierces the heavy air. Whooshing vacuums suck up any dust that may be created when workers drill into the planes' lightweight carbon composite material. Security concerns in the plant are real. "Conversation-restricted area," says one sign. As we walk past a fenced-off zone, our guide quips, "You've gotta have secret clearance. I can't even go in there!" The rock star engine Then, like a holy relic brought back from the Crusades -- Boeing lets us touch "it." By "it" we mean the GE90-115B. Guinness calls it the most powerful commercially produced jet engine in the world. We gather around this rock star engine like thirsty travelers at a desert oasis, each taking turns running our hands across its silver exterior. The lip of the engine's mouth feels rough, like it has countless scratches etched into it. That design, engineers discovered, helps reduce noise. This 19,000-pound monster hangs from the wing of a giant 777, but the engine still looks humongous -- measuring more than 11 feet in diameter. In fact, Boeing says it's so big you could fit the body of a 737 airliner inside it. "There's no way to sense the sheer size of an airplane without being right there underneath it," says NYCAviation.com contributor Ben Granucci, enjoying his first Aviation Geek Fest. Engines like this make it possible for wide-body planes to fly long-distance routes nonstop with only two engines instead of three or four. In fact, the 777 flies many of the world's longest nonstop routes. In 2005 it set the world distance record for a nonstop commercial airline flight, jetting 13,423 miles from Hong Kong eastbound to London in 22 hours, 22 minutes. The world's top flying hauler Just a few hours earlier, a handful of aviation geeks were hanging out at a hotel next to Paine Field, the airport Boeing uses to test and deliver the factory's planes. Then, Granucci tweeted out that the plane that hauls the most cargo by volume in the world just happened to be passing through. Good morning #AGF14-ers! There is a Dreamlifter inbound, due to land at about 8:10 this morning. Count me in. Soon, a dozen camera-wielding geeks are lined up outside the hotel to welcome the Dreamlifter -- a modified 747 -- as it lumbers in for a landing. "We're gonna be late for breakfast," says avgeek Steve Dillo as he snaps photo after photo. "But this is worth it." The thing roars like a lion, but it looks like a whale as it slows for touchdown. In the entire world, there are only four of these giant planes. Boeing uses them to ferry big sections of the 787 for final assembly here in Everett. Last year, when a Dreamlifter landed at the wrong airport in Kansas, it wasn't exactly a stellar moment. The Avgeek News Network This is the fifth avgeek fest, co-sponsored by AirlineReporter.com and Everett's Future of Flight Museum. The February convention drew a record 300-plus participants from 18 different states and three countries. Former GM and Toyota engineer Philip McKenzie, flew 8,000 miles from Melbourne, Australia, to see how "things are laid out" in the factory. Vancouver Airport official Trevor Batstone traveled 100 miles from Canada. Who are these people -- these avgeeks? What defines them? "It's someone who always looks up in the sky when they hear a jet roar," says Ryan Ewing, 14, who runs airlinegeeks.com out of his Bethesda, Maryland, home. Ewing was right there in the thick of the geeks with his camera when the Dreamlifter came calling. The event was born from an aviation-obsessed online community that uses social media to organize and share information. Aviation news sites like Airchive, AirlineReporter, NYCAviation and AirlineGuys all share common friends, connections and interests. When news breaks, their informal social network sometimes challenges traditional news media. This month AirlineReporter and a few other aviation sites broke news about the hijacking of an Ethiopian Airlines 767 in Rome about 30 minutes before many "legacy" news organizations, says AirlineReporter founder and editor-in-chief David Parker Brown. #BREAKING: Ethiopian Airlines' Flight 702 Squawks "HiJacking" for Reasons Unknown #ET702 details: http://t.co/XrN4P1yzoN Boeing's desire to connect with fans and fliers combined with the emerging power of the avgeek nation opened the doors to the exclusive Boeing tours, Brown says. "Boeing has increasingly realized how smart and educated about aviation avgeeks are." Baby Boeings The following day southeast of Seattle, Boeing opens up yet another factory for us to tour. This one is the birthplace of what Guinness calls the "most produced large commercial jet in aviation history" -- the 737. No public tours here. This is a tour for avgeeks and VIPs. "Avgeeks love getting access to places that are off limits," says Brown. "It's all about exclusivity." Here's some 737 tour trivia: This place creates 38 of the planes every month on a moving assembly line. And they're pushing to increase that rate. "Even though we joke that the 737 is the 'Baby Boeing,' it's still a large and complex machine," says Granucci. "It requires precision to put it together. The fact that you can perform such precise work on a moving target -- I find that to be incredible."  The facility receives pre-assembled fuselages by train from a factory in Wichita, Kansas.  Workers attach wings to the fuselages. It takes about nine hours to put wings on a 737. The planes also get "winglets"  the tiny, upward pointing wings you see on the wingtips of 737s and other airliners. These doodads reduce drag on the plane and make it more fuel efficient  by about 4%. Workers install seats on the planes by using a loading machine they call a "hay baler."  In an operation called "high blow," Boeing tests each plane's passenger cabin for possible leaks during pressurization. The procedure includes putting people inside the planes to listen for leaks.  Each 737 is made up of 42 miles of wire and 394,000 separate parts  If there's a problem on the assembly line, workers activate a purple flashing light -- alerting others that they need help. "Blinking purple is bad for us here," says Christian Ofsthus, a Boeing senior manager. "If there's something wrong, something doesn't fit, we need to do something about that." As the tour ends, we wind through an employee diner named for the World War II symbol Rosie the Riveter, and file back onto our bus. Driving off the property, we spot a train loaded with brand new wingless 737 fuselages headed to the factory behind us. That triggers spontaneous applause and scattered whoops throughout the bus. Well, you just can't get any geekier than that. "That is so cool," I hear someone say. "Yeah," said someone else, "baby planes!"  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/20/travel/spruce-goose-museum/index.html	travel	Museum: Giant Spruce Goose aviation icon is safe - CNN.com	2014/01/20	Monday Jan 20 08:23:43 EST 2014	(CNN) -- Bob Lyon remembers the day he met Howard Hughes. He also recalls when Hughes nearly crashed a plane into his boyhood home. Nearly 40 years after Hughes died, Lyon's life still crosses paths with the eccentric billionaire.  Lyon has found himself in the center of a dispute over Hughes' gigantic, bizarre wooden seaplane nicknamed the Spruce Goose. This thing is arguably the world's most famous airplane and -- at five stories tall with a wingspan longer than a football field -- one of the biggest on the planet. Related: Stalking the world's biggest planes The Spruce Goose's home is a respected aviation museum, which is part of an investigation by the state of Oregon. Here's the story: In 1992, Evergreen Aviation and Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon, struck a half-million-dollar deal with Aero Club of Southern California to buy the legendary plane. Lyon -- who represents Aero Club -- is now negotiating the plane's final payment, which he estimates at about $50,000. For Lyon, this is way more than everyday business. "This plane was a part of my life," said Lyon, 77. "I saw it being built. I saw it being put together." Unfortunately, negotiations have hit a snag. More on that in a minute. First, you gotta know about the amazing story surrounding the plane and the man who flew it. Its official name was the H-4. Hughes called it the Hercules. Designed to carry more than 700 troops, the Spruce Goose flew only once. In 1947 in Long Beach harbor, it grabbed about 70 feet of air for about a mile. Hughes  who piloted the test flight  said it needed more development. He never let it fly again. Was the flight a failure, as some newspapers suggested? Depends on who you ask. Hughes did prove the thing could fly. But it was never officially certified. Lawmakers hauled Hughes before a congressional committee to justify the plane's taxpayer price tag of $22 million. Hughes pointed out that he had spent an additional $18 million of his own funds to develop the plane. Fearless rogue pilot When Lyon met Hughes, it wasn't the OCD-plagued, naked, bearded recluse portrayed near the end of Martin Scorsese's "The Aviator." This was before that. This was a younger Hughes -- the seemingly fearless, rogue pilot and entrepreneur who was hell-bent on success for his aircraft manufacturing company. Lyon was then 10 years old. Hughes seemed like a likable person when they met at the office of Lyon's father -- who was Hughes' patent lawyer. "I'd never seen a tall, lanky, guy with a Texas accent before," he remembers. "I grew up in Southern California." In July 1946, the young Lyon had a more memorable brush with the man when Hughes crashed a prototype reconnaissance plane a block away from his parents' Beverly Hills home. The boy arrived at the crash scene to see a fire, a huge column of black smoke and what was left of three damaged houses. No one was killed, but Lyon saw an ambulance driver help transport a seriously injured victim. "That turned out to be Howard Hughes," he said. Soon, other neighborhood kids descended on the scene and started grabbing small pieces of wreckage and running off with them as souvenirs. Lyon remembers police canvassing the neighborhood looking for the missing debris. "My brother and I were upstairs and my mother went to the front door and there were two officers from the Beverly Hills police department asking, 'Do you have any young children in this house?' She yelled upstairs to us, saying, 'Do you have some pieces of that airplane?' We said, 'No!' And she said, 'Yes, I think you do! Bring them down here! The police are here and they want them.' So we pulled this piece of metal out from underneath my brother's bed and took it downstairs," Lyon recalled with a chuckle. "We thought that was highly unfair." That same year Lyon watched trucks roll the Spruce Goose down local streets from the plane's construction site on Los Angeles' west side to Long Beach. They "cut telephone and power lines to get this huge thing down the road." Hughes died in 1976 at age 70, and by the early 1980s the Spruce Goose was forced to move out of its giant Long Beach hangar. The plane's owners -- including Hughes' Summa Corp. and the U.S. government -- gave the plane to the Aero Club. The transfer forestalled tax expenses and the prospect of cutting the plane into pieces for display at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington. "The Aero Club's mission in this whole thing was to save the Spruce Goose," said Lyon. The club leased the plane to a company as a tourist attraction. Spruce Goose was moved a short distance away to a spectacular seaside dome next to the moored luxury liner Queen Mary. Around that time, during a celebration dinner, Lyon arrived late to what was supposed to be an escorted tour of the plane. He took the liberty of exploring it alone. Lyon, who also has an engineering degree and a pilot's license, said it was like being a "kid in a candy store." He wandered inside one of the aircraft's gigantic wings, amazed at the plane's engineering. He climbed up a set of stairs into the cockpit, daring to sit in the pilot seat where Hughes flew the plane in 1947. "I noted that there were controls for the pilot, but none for the co-pilot," Lyon said with a chuckle. "Yeah, Howard was gonna fly it. He didn't need any help." Eventually the Spruce Goose had to leave the dome. That's when Aero Club struck a bargain with Evergreen and the behemoth was floated up the West Coast on barges in a spectacular 138-day moving operation to Oregon. Now, Lyon is piloting Aero Club's negotiations for the plane's final payment. The dispute, said Lyon, basically comes down to a payment formula and the interpretation of three words: justifiable operating expense. "It's a problem of contract interpretation," Lyon said. News media reports have overstated the negotiations' worst-case scenario, he explained. "We're not interested in repossessing it. It would be a nightmare." For its part, the museum agrees with Lyon. "... both sides expect a prompt resolution of that payment," the museum said in a statement. Although the museum declined CNN's requests for an interview, the museum's statement said the facility remains open, is financially viable and has no plans to close. Bottom line: museum-goers -- which number around 150,000 a year -- have nothing to fear, Lyon said. "The Spruce Goose is going to stay where it is." "The museum is no danger of losing the Spruce Goose," echoed Evergreen spokeswoman Melissa Grace in a statement. "It will stay at its home at the museum for visitors to enjoy for years to come." But the museum faces another financial issue. For months the Evergreen museum, and a related organization called the Captain Michael Smith Educational Institute, have been part of an investigation by Oregon's Justice Department. Agency spokesman Michael Kron said the investigation was sparked by "people who were concerned about financial transactions by Evergreen." The museum owner holds companies that are for-profit and some that are nonprofit. There have been allegations of improper transfer of funds between the two types of companies. The museum said it is independent, self-sufficient and nonprofit. Kron describes the probe as a "charitable activities investigation into the charity that runs the museum." Recently, a broker listed two of the museum's plane exhibits -- a 1945 Grumman Avenger for $250,000 and a 1928 Ford Tri-Motor  for $1.75 million. It's unknown if the museum's decision to sell the planes is linked to its financial issues. "The vast majority" of the museum's aircraft exhibits, it said, "are unaffected by issues" linked to the investigation. Evergreen said most of the planes on display at the museum are on loan from some of the best aviation museums in the world, including the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force, the Smithsonian Institution National Air and Space Museum and the National Naval Aviation Museum. The museum says it's "in no danger of losing its displays from these and other sources" and it has "cooperated with the Department of Justice in its review and that we are confident the Department of Justice would acknowledge our cooperation and the good work we have put into addressing concerns it has raised." Kron said a final investigation report is expected to be made public soon. Meanwhile, Lyon is nearing the finish line as a custodian of this aviation icon. During the two decades since the Spruce Goose deal was struck, he's never traveled to Oregon to see the plane. But, he said, who knows? When it's all said and done, he may fly up for a visit.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/09/travel/irpt-croman-wavephoto/index.html	travel	Risking his life for the perfect wave - CNN.com	2014/04/09	Wednesday Apr 9 08:20:47 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Kenji Croman has broken bones, dislocated his shoulder and elbow, endured concussions and nearly drowned several times. He's also had three close encounters with sharks over the years. A 10-foot wave landed directly on top of him five years ago, bending his body to the point that he actually kicked himself in the head. "I literally heard every bone in my body crack," he said. 29 beach photos that'll make you drool Croman has been photographing ocean waves since 2008, sometimes risking his life to get that perfect shot at the surf break. Despite the risks and inevitable injuries that come with wave photography, the Hawaii resident, body surfer and former competitive swimmer wouldn't do anything else. The 36-year-old photographer loves the thrill of meeting the barrel of a wave head on, shooting waves as his passion and shooting surfers to pay the bills. Some of his business involves creating Instagram promotions for Dos Equis, Maui Sunrise Shells and other companies. He has been able to shoot some of the most beautiful and untouched beaches in South America and Mexico through a Kickstarter fundraising campaign. But most of his wave photos are taken close to home. His favorite moment? When the sun rises at Sandy Beach in Oahu, Hawaii, but the waves there are good at any hour. What Croman loves about waves is how each one is unpredictable and as unique as a fingerprint. And he captures waves from an angle that allows spectators to see them breaking in slow motion as he does. The process of photographing waves requires more than just swimming out to where the surf breaks and waiting, he says. The night before a photo shoot Croman checks Surfline.com, a website and streaming coastal HD camera network that provides live and predicted ocean weather information, to see what the winds, waves and tide will be like at certain times. "If the winds are blowing offshore, this creates nice barrels and usually better conditions than if the winds are blowing onshore." Croman has both a primary camera and a backup for emergencies. He goes without a wetsuit but wears fins and uses heavy duty underwater housing to protect his camera. There is no great way for him to protect himself. He admits there is probably protective gear he should be wearing, but there is little he could have done to decrease the impact of the 10-foot wave that crashed on top of him. Croman was rushed to the hospital where his doctor initially thought he had broken his neck. His neck was fine, but he was hospitalized for a week and spinal fluid leaked out of his ear, he says. The hardest part of Croman's job is staying calm in the face of breaking waves when his initial instinct is to panic and swim away. He once risked his life to shoot a 25-foot wave but the resulting photo "looked like a three-foot wave," he says. The 25-foot rock in the background "didn't give it the right depth you need to show how big the wave was." Croman studies the swells, searching for patterns and trying to time when a wave will break. At most, Croman will take two to three shots of a single wave. "I've shot waves for so many years now that I see the wave in slow motion," he said.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/17/travel/ireport-letter-to-chicago/index.html	travel	Dear Chicago, we love you despite it all - CNN.com	2014/04/17	Thursday Apr 17 08:17:01 EDT 2014	Editor's note: CNN asked you to tell us what you love about Chicago, and some of your enthusiastic responses are included in this article.  (CNN) -- Dear Chicago, You sure aren't perfect. Numerous city aldermen and officials have been brought down by corruption charges. Your schools are failing. You have a high rate of gun violence, which has cast shadows upon your reputation. Despite the long list of wrongs, there are a lot of things you do right. Lifelong Chicagoans and loving visitors are consistently complimentary of you. We say this without shame: Chicago, we love you, imperfections and all. You are 77 official neighborhoods, according to the mayor's office. But more than 200 "pocket" neighborhoods make up your anatomy. WBEZ: Who creates Chicago's neighborhoods? Your people ride through your bloodstream on the L, where we can see your distinct personalities in each lively neighborhood. Concert venues and Al Capone's favorite hangout, the Green Mill, beam as we zoom through Uptown. The Garfield Park Conservatory emanates natural beauty on the West Side. And lessons from the past fill our minds as we near the DuSable Museum of African American History in Washington Park. "Chicago is the world in one place. It's being able to get tacos in Little Village one day for lunch and tzatziki in Greek Town the next," says 21-year-old student Reynaldo Leal. Persian, Polish or Puerto Rican, you've got the world covered. Your citizens make you who you are, with people from across the globe calling you home. Some stay put in their ethnic enclaves, speaking their native tongues, while others are curious neighborhood hoppers who seek authentic food and culture. Chicago. Just saying your name is enough to conjure fond memories for Amanda Fallico. She can imagine riding down Lake Shore Drive on a warm summer evening. Summer is when our love for you crescendos. You are at your peak of liveliness. Tight-knit families watching movies in the park, children playing games at North Avenue Beach and couples strolling along the magnificent lakefront are some of the things that bring you to life come summer. "Chicago's parks are the settings for (a) world-class collection of sculptures, and the people of Chicago are lucky enough to have them in their backyard," says Matt Kochar. But even in the winter, for any of us who brave the never-ending snowfall and brutal, subzero wind chills, you are truly a beauty. When the tourists are too scared to come outside, it's us locals who get the rare treat of staring into Cloud Gate (affectionately known as "the Bean") all alone. Zahava Hanuka witnessed your quiet side during a moment just like this. While the Bean, Chicago Picasso and Alexander Calder's Flamingo are all figures of beauty, your buildings and stunning skyscrapers are architectural marvels in themselves. Whether we're lost in the past of the historic Rookery building or meandering through the urban canyons beneath the futuresque Trump Tower, your architecture tells us the story of your life. Sometimes, you talk to us through your buildings. When the Blackhawks made the playoffs last year, skyscrapers lit up with words of encouragement. The same treatment goes for the Bears, Bulls, Sox and well, someday the Cubs. (Here's to hoping someone breaks the Curse of the Billy Goat soon!) Share your Wrigley Field photos Your cheering buildings prove you're a big city that doesn't take yourself too seriously. As Swathi Sridhara puts it, "Chicagoans have a unique blend of small-town Midwest charm and a gritty city work ethic." And if your gleaming towers and your potholed streets are your skeleton, then your heart lies in your people. Farhaj Hassan, who moved away as a child, said it well: "Chicago doesn't just reside in our heart -- it is our heart. Chicago is us, we of Chicago are Chicago." Chicago, no matter what anyone says, we will always be proud to call you home. Love, Chicagoans everywhere Author Christina Zdanowicz is a proud native of Chicagoland who refuses to call the Sears Tower by its new name and unabashedly cheers for the Cubs.

Share your photos with CNN iReport. (CNN) -- Our winter blues are about to turn pink! This year's National Cherry Blossom Festival starts in Washington on Thursday. The annual event attracts more than a million people from across the country and abroad. The festival is starting on the first day of spring, as always, but peak bloom is predicted to be later this season because of the brutal winter in the D.C. area. "We're really excited to welcome spring with all this winter weather," said Danielle Davis, a festival spokeswoman. The National Park Service says peak bloom, the day when 70% of the blossoms of the Yoshino cherry trees around the Tidal Basin are open, is forecast to fall between April 8 and 12. The average peak bloom date for the past 21 years has been March 31. As one of the largest springtime festivals in the United States, the start of cherry blossom season may finally mean old man winter is retiring for the year. If you can't make a trip to the nation's capital to see these delicate flowers, then you're in luck, because we've got a collection of beautiful blossom photos from previous years to share with you.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/13/travel/hawaii-ways-to-feel-local/index.html	travel	11 best ways to experience Hawaii - CNN.com	2014/03/13	Thursday Mar 13 11:24:44 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Michele Bigley has split her time between California and Hawaii since 2006. She is the author of "Backroads and Byways of Hawaii" and "Explorer's Guide to Kauai, A Great Destination." (CNN) -- When visiting Hawaii, who doesn't imagine packing up and relocating to America's tropical wonderland? The epic sunshine and the rainbows, the afternoons of shave ice on glorious beaches inspire millions to vacation in the Aloha State each year. Before you sell off your belongings and pack your bags, try to experience the islands like a true Hawaiian to see whether you have what it takes to handle all that paradise. Leave your cell phone at the hotel, and take off your watch. You're in Hawaii, and everything moves at a slower pace. Life is measured by the sun, surf and simple pleasures. Make time for a morning stroll through Oahu's greenbelt to swim in Jackass Ginger Pool (a natural swimming hole accessed from the Judd Memorial Trail), a Sunday afternoon serenade at Molokai Coffee Plantation, an impromptu swim in the ocean without so much as a nod in the direction of the sea turtles feeding by the nearby rocks. 29 beach photos that'll make you drool Forget the overpriced resort food. Locals know that the real ono grindz (Hawaiian for yummy food) comes from joints like Maui's Bully's Burgers (on Piilani Highway, the backroad to Hana, 808-878-3272) or Oahu's Nico's Pier 38. And don't bother forking over the big bucks for gourmet poke, a delicacy of raw marinated ahi and onions. Instead, pick up the freshest ahi at local favorites like the Big Isle's Da Poke Shack and Kauai's Koloa Fish Market (808-742-6199). Hula is not mere booty-shaking. Each movement of this ancient dance tells a multilayered story, rich with meaning. A hand toward the air might mean sky but can speak of a lost love. To really feel like a Hawaiian, sign up for a hula class. Companies like Hawaii Hula Company teach private hula lessons for both locals and tourists on Oahu and Maui. Accept it: Hawaii is expensive. Locals don't flinch at paying $10 for a quart of milk. But if you excavate their kitchens, you'll spot heaps of head-sized avocados, grapefruits and lemons taking up space on the counter. The key to shopping like a Hawaiian is making friends with both Costco and the farmers' markets. Oahu's KCC Farmers' Market, Kapaa's Wednesday afternoon market on Kauai and the Big Island's Saturday morning Keauhou Farmers Market are some of the best in the state. Record-setting natural wonders in the U.S. Have a relationship with the ocean, but respect its power. Surf's up, a swell hit the North Shore, and suddenly shopkeepers lock their doors and head to the beach. You want to join the crowds? Check in with yourself. Be honest about your abilities. Only the most advanced surfers should take on winter north shore swells on any of the islands. Newbies can learn on the more mellow summer waves or the easier waters at beaches like Maui's Kalama Park. Party like the ancients. A real luau is not some big-budget affair held in a resort. Usually, families hold luaus for a first birthday party or major special event. They often take place on the grassy knolls above a beach and feature lots of barbecued meats, a large cooked pig, poi (an acquired taste; even most locals can't stomach the bland pureed taro), Molokai sweet potatoes, lomilomi (a salmon concoction that requires you to massage the fish) and plenty of live music. Rather than forking over the big bucks (up to $100 a head at most resorts) for a choreographed luau, throw your own party. Beaches like Oahu's Ala Moana, Kauai's Anini Beach and Maui's Kamaole Beach Parks offer the perfect setting to celebrate life in the islands. (Spike a) Drink like the natives. Thirsty? Don't bother hoofing it to the store. Instead, scale a palm tree, grab a coconut, return to your condo, machete it open, mix with rum and enjoy a seriously fresh cocktail. If your tree climbing skills need some work, Hawaii has its share of spirit makers. Kauai's Koloa Rum, Maui's Ocean Vodka, the Big Island's Kona Brewing Company (they also have an outpost on Oahu) and Maui Brewing Company's outstanding coconut porter all help enliven an evening. Plus, tours and tastings are offered at their facilities. 22 can't-miss U.S. beaches Traffic is a part of life in paradise, too. It's unavoidable these days. Most islands (save Molokai and Lanai) are plagued with gridlock during the morning and afternoon commutes. And it's not just the tourists lining up to brave the Road to Hana. The worst backups are on Honolulu's highways and on Maui and Kauai's thoroughfares into town. At least if you have to be stuck in the car, you can appreciate the beauty as you listen to local tunes on the public radio broadcasts. Favorites include Kauai's KKCR and the Big Island's KAPA radio. Toss the socks. It's all about the slippahs, aloha shirts and board shorts on the islands. The casual dress sure is appealing. Getting dressed up in Hawaii means tossing on your aloha shirt (though please don't get matching ones in his and hers) and being adorned by a lei (if it's a special occasion) or a large flower in a woman's hair. Typical island wear consists of shorts and T-shirts for just about everyone. Learn at least a few words of the Hawaiian language. To show respect, learn a few words. If nothing else, know what a haole is (a not-always-nice way to refer to a mainlander) or aloha (which means hello, goodbye and love), makai (the ocean side of the street) and mauka (the mountain side of the street), which are common directional terms worth adding to your vocabulary. However, while on the islands, don't start speaking in pidgin (the Hawaiian dialect). That's the equivalent of going to England and trying to speak in a Cockney accent. Incorporate the Aloha Spirit into your day. Aloha's a state of mind, a series of actions, not merely a word. At its core, it means treating the world and others like they are a part of you. Living the Aloha Spirit involves sharing your kindness and wisdom, your heart and your true self with your community. Hawaiian people come together to help each other out, whether that means cleaning up your trash or helping rebuild a house upended by a storm. Getting into the community and giving rather than taking is the most rewarding way to be able to call yourself Hawaiian. This can manifest as a smile or supporting a local business. All that matters is that everyone works in tandem to spread the love. Not a bad way to live, huh? Do you live in Hawaii? What's the best way to get a true sense of the islands? 
http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/04/travel/scottish-castles-for-tartan-day/index.html	travel	10 of Scotland's spectacular castles - CNN.com	2014/04/04	Friday Apr 4 10:06:20 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- In the best fairy tales, there is always a castle: tall turrets, an intimidating moat and a breathtaking view. In Scotland, those ancient castles overlook deep lochs and tower over cities. The wandering traveler will find these envy-inducing castles in every corner of Scotland. In honor of Sunday's National Tartan Day, a holiday celebrating the influential role Scots have played in American history, CNN has chosen 10 magnificent castles to explore in the old country. From the capital city of Edinburgh to the dramatic landscapes of the Highlands, here are some of the most striking castles in Scotland. Cue the castle-owning daydreaming. 27 photos of glorious Ireland Eilean Donan, Inverness-shire This 13th-century castle in the middle of a loch is one of the most iconic in Scotland. Located in the Highlands looking out toward the Isle of Skye, this stunning castle is connected to the mainland via footbridge. It was restored in the early 20th century and is often featured in television and movies. Visitors can wander through the rooms to see period furniture, artifacts and weaponry. Edinburgh Castle, City of Edinburgh Perhaps the most famous (and most visited) castle in Scotland is right in the center of the capital city. Perched on top of the city on Castle Rock, this fortress has a strong presence in Edinburgh's skyline. The oldest section of the castle dates to the 12th century, and many visitors travel here specifically to see the Crown Jewels of Scotland. Guided tours are available. Culzean Castle, Ayrshire  Observant travelers might recognize Culzean Castle from the back of the 5-pound note issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland. This cliffside castle on the Ayrshire coast has been associated with the Kennedy family for centuries. It is a particularly memorable example of a fairy tale-like structure with its turrets and battlements, stationed above the stormy seas and surrounded by gardens and forests. Ballindalloch Castle, Banffshire  Often called "The Pearl of the North," this 16th-century castle is in the heart of one of Scotland's whisky regions, Speyside. Unlike other castles in Scotland, this is one of the few castles in the country that remains private: The Macpherson-Grant family has continually lived here over the centuries. The castle is open to visitors during the summer months and has a shop with a variety of Scottish goods including tartans and jewelry. 8 elegant U.S. mansion hotels Castle Fraser, Aberdeenshire Movie buffs might recognize Castle Fraser from "The Queen," starring Helen Mirren (it appeared as a backdrop). Castle Fraser is one of the grandest, most romantic-looking castles in the country. Built between 1575 and 1636, the castle sits on more than 300 acres of landscaped grounds and woodlands. Inside, it has the feeling of a family home with portraits of the Fraser family and original furniture. Stirling Castle, Stirlingshire  One of the largest (and most important from a historic/architectural perspective) castles is Stirling Castle. An easy trip from both Edinburgh and Glasgow, this castle was once the destination of knights and nobles who flocked to the luxurious property with its elaborate gardens. It's a good spot for families to visit; costumed characters in historic roles are on the grounds, and children can dress up in period costumes and play medieval instruments. Earth's greatest unexplored places Urquhart Castle, Inverness-shire  The mythical Loch Ness Monster, Nessie, might lure travelers to the Scottish Highlands, but it is Urquhart Castle that delivers the drama. One of the most-visited castles in the country, this castle's Grand Tower overlooks expansive Loch Ness. An early medieval fortification was built here, but the ruins seen today date to the 13th to 16th centuries. The castle also played a strategic role in the Wars of Scottish Independence. Glamis Castle, Angus One of the most towering -- and historically interesting -- castles in Scotland is Glamis Castle. This structure has the claim to fame as being the setting for Shakespeare's "Macbeth," along with being the childhood home of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother (her younger daughter, Princess Margaret, was born here). The surrounding estate is made up of 14,000 acres of gardens, farms and forests. Inveraray Castle, Argyllshire  Located in western Scotland on the shore of Loch Fyne, this castle has a fairytale facade with an enchanting interior. Many visitors indulge in the tea room here, offering a glimpse into royal life. "Downton Abbey" fans might recognize it from the season 3 Christmas episode. The castle has a lovely 16-acre garden surrounded by a massive 60,000-acre estate. Crathes Castle, Aberdeenshire Found in the Aberdeenshire woodlands, Crathes Castle dates to the 16th century and has ties to Scottish warrior-king Robert the Bruce. Towers, turrets, and ghost stories make this an especially intriguing castle to visit, along with the beautiful walled garden. Travelers interested in art will be drawn to the collection of portraits and painted ceilings.

He's digging for medieval tools in the fields around an abandoned friary. Or they're simply hearing their native language spoken a bit differently in a different country, where the food doesn't quite taste the same. Travel can introduce kids to the world's real-life wonders, changing their perspective on topics they may have only read about in books. It can literally change their lives. "There is a kid's way of seeing the world," says Keith Bellows, editor-in-chief of National Geographic Traveler magazine and author of National Geographic's "100 Places That Can Change Your Child's Life." "As an adult, get out of the way, and stop marching them through an experience. When you get them to slow down and experience a place from their perspective, it's magic. Not just the place itself, but the experience." Consider Bellows' suggestions a step up from simply taking a vacation. He says these places could open your child's eyes to the diversity of the world, help them learn what interests them and inform how they navigate it as adults. Marco Island, Florida Of course Walt Disney World is a Florida rite of passage for many children (and their parents) but there's so much to the state that isn't prefabricated. Marco Island is one of those places for Bellows, with beaches showing off the rusticity and charm of old Florida. Kids will love the beach and you can sneak in some science in the spectacular nature surrounding you. To Disney or not to Disney? Get on board the Dolphin Explorer with your children and turn them into citizen scientists. Capt. Chris Desmond, founder of the 10,000 Islands Dolphins Project, directs children to note the family compositions, behavior and even evidence of shark bites of the dolphins they spot. They give the data to adult biologists onboard who feed it into a computer. The bonus: If a child spots a new dolphin -- most are already known to the crew -- that child gets to name the dolphin. "Every kid wants to spot a newcomer and it happened on a trip I was on," says Bellows. Big Sur, California The drive from San Francisco into Big Sur may be Bellows' favorite drive in the world. "It is one of the most hair-raising drives in the world, and you get the sense of a wild, driving adventure," he says. "I've done it at least 40 or 50 times, and I never get tired of it." He recommends renting a convertible and coming down from San Francisco through the agriculture fields onto the California coast, much of which is protected and can be explored along the way. One highlight: Point Lobos State Natural Reserve, just north of Big Sur. "It really teaches children that if you really love an area, you can protect it. Most of that coastline is protected, and it shows you what happens when you don't screw it up. " Grand Canyon Nothing makes Bellows feel more humble than standing on the lip of the Grand Canyon, even if he's standing with thousands of other people. "It's a bite out of the Earth, a thrilling glimpse into the inside of the Earth," he says. Top U.S. spots for family fun When children see the canyon layers below, that's the first step in their understanding of the geology of the Earth, says Bellows. Take an age-appropriate hike so your children can see the layers and wildlife that make up the canyon. "They can see we didn't just spring from nothing. This is a wafer sandwich of the world, and we're going to be one of the layers one day." Chesapeake Bay, Maryland The nation's largest estuary, the Chesapeake Bay is filled with 64,000 square miles of rivers, marshes and bays. "My kids have grown up there kneeling in grass, looking for tadpoles and pulling up crab pots ... and I love it," says Bellows. "It's some of the wildest primitive country we have. You can watch the ebb and flow of oysters, crabs and fishes, and it tells you how you're treating this incredible place." It's the home of the wild ponies children have read about it in Marguerite Henry's "Misty of Chincoteague." Those ponies of Assateague Island National Seashore live in two herds. You can see the ponies at the park but don't feed them (to keep them wild). Library of Congress, Washington It's OK to tell your children that the movie "National Treasure: Book of Secrets" was filmed at the Library of Congress. (Heck, show them the movie in advance of your trip.) And yes, that it's the biggest library in the world with 3,800 staff, 500 miles of shelving and 128 million items (with about 10,000 items added each day). 7 tips for cherry blossom fun in D.C. "If you go into the Library of Congress, you're going to tell them it's a library but it's also a treasure trove," says Bellows. Whatever your child likes, whether it's music or maps or sports or humor, it's likely he or she can find something about it here. Your children also can get a "Passport to Knowledge" to guide them to the library's so-called greatest hits, and they can play at Knowledge Quest kiosks and bookmark places of interest to explore later on a personalized mini-site. New York City A visit to New York for every child who has not grown up there is also a rite of passage, says Bellows. "Every kid has to go to New York City, and every adult does, too," he says. "Every time you go back and haven't been there for awhile, it's a new place. It's so big and so fast." Take the Circle Line boat tour, he suggests, so you can see by sailing around it how small an island Manhattan actually is. You can notice how connected it is to the other islands of Staten Island and Long Island (where Brooklyn and Queens are) and the Bronx, which is actually on the U.S mainland. "Here's an island in the middle of nowhere but it's connected to the entire world." For children seeing the Statue of Liberty, a Broadway show or the city decorated at Christmas for the first time, "it gets imprinted on kids' minds." London London is a starter city for U.S. parents who want to take their kids out of the country, after you've explored the nearest metropolitan city and your national parks. "They speak English in London but a child will know just how foreign it is, with things like Marmite," says Bellows. "The wonderful thing about it is, this is a little like Harry Potter world. It's familiar enough to be safe and foreign enough to be thrilling." Older children will love the ghoulish (and true) tales of the Tower of London. Begun in the 1070s by William the Conqueror, the tower was Europe's first fortress. Queen Anne Boleyn was beheaded there in 1536 and is rumored to still haunt the place. Trim, Ireland How could medieval warriors run in chain mail armor? How heavy is a stone ax, really? Head to the ruins of the Dominican Black Friary, a short distance from Trim Castle in the town of Trim, Ireland. Once a home for religious men and women, the friary's ruins are being excavated in a special way. Visitors can get a crash course in excavation and start digging and recording their findings side-by-side with archaeologists and geologists. Younger children get to play at a camp, where they get to pick up heavy stone axes and run in chain mail. Older children will enjoy a tour of nearby Trim Castle, which starred in the movie "Braveheart." Hugh de Lacy and his son Walter began construction of the castle, the largest Anglo-Norman castle in Ireland, in the 1170s. The castle protected the medieval village, once a commercial and religious powerhouse. "What amazing architects these people were, and how remarkably old this is," says Bellows. "It's the quintessential castle. It's knights, bow and arrows and blood on the ground." Muskoka, Canada Bellows grew up in Muskoka, two hours north of Toronto in Ontario's cottage country. "This is where kids can really connect with wilderness, even more so than the Chesapeake," he says. "There are dark lakes and loons at night. You can come out to a fish, flip the canoes and find the air holes underneath." Almost anyone can rent a cabin in this area known for its more than 1,600 lakes and leave electronic entertainment behind, he says. "It is simple, simple living. You can take off your shoes for days" and simply run around barefoot. Galapagos Islands There's no doubt this trip is expensive. People who want to visit the Galapagos Islands have to take approved tours, designed to protect the islands' fragile ecology. This is where Charles Darwin developed his theory of evolution, where nearby islands have different ecologies and animals who have adapted differently to their environments. "There is no place like it in the world," says Bellows. "I've been twice, and the first time I went, I realized what Darwin was talking about. You see two birds who look the same but they have different vocalizations. It's like two people speaking English but one person is from Brooklyn and the other is from Boston." The animals have no fear of humans, so your children will swim with dolphins and turtles and play near seals. But it's not all peaceful. "I saw a seal attacked by a shark and dying, tortoises leaning into each other, both dead," he says. "You're on a beach and you see crabs hatch prematurely in the middle of the day, slowly breaking down. It's Darwin's theory of evolution and the survival of the fittest." A tough, but essential, life lesson. Where do you want to take your children before they grow up? What do you think is important or them to see? Please share in the comments below.   
http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/17/travel/amsterdam-travel-legal-parameters/index.html	travel	Amsterdam for tourists: What's legal? - CNN.com	2013/07/17	Wednesday Jul 17 08:19:21 EDT 2013	Amsterdam (CNN) -- You may have noticed an interesting reaction when you tell people you're traveling to Amsterdam. They sometimes get that curious look, that knowing half-smile on their faces. "Amsterdam," they say with a mischievous grin, "lucky you!" Are they thinking about Van Gogh and Rembrandt, about the fabulous museums, the flowing canals, the teeming bicycle paths, the gorgeous tulips -- or is it something else? To many, Amsterdam is synonymous with freedom. With the ability to do what is forbidden in other places. Throwback lodging: Stay in another era Undoubtedly, millions travel to the Netherlands to see the just re-opened Rijksmuseum and its famous "Night Watch" painting, along with many other attractions of this truly charming city. But, let's face it, Amsterdam conjures another fascination. Decades before anyone else considered legalizing marijuana, prostitution or gay marriage, the Dutch stood -- as they still do today -- at the forefront of change on many controversial social issues, legalizing or tolerating a range of activities that other countries placed squarely outside what they consider legally and socially acceptable. That is not to say other countries did not have recreational drugs, homosexuality and prostitution. But the Dutch, with their history of practicality and compromise, decided to deal with these matters in a pragmatic way. In the process, they created a whole new world for tourists craving tolerance and a brush with the forbidden. Amsterdam remains a magnet for travelers who find the idea of smoking marijuana in public -- perhaps in front of a passing cop to add to the experience -- simply irresistible. Still, there are great misconceptions about what is and is not legal here. The picture of a hedonistic free-for-all is not altogether accurate. The Dutch are a people of rules and laws. Although they also have an interesting approach to certain issues, where the law says one thing and the official policy is to look the other way. 8 hotels still fresh at 100 So what, precisely, is legal in the Netherlands? You may be surprised to learn that recreational drugs are illegal in the Netherlands. Yes, even pot. But an official policy of tolerance emerged and in 1976 the Dutch parliament decriminalized possession of less than 5 grams of cannabis. That gave rise to a type of establishment found only in this country. In hundreds of "coffee shops" across the country -- not to be confused with "cafes" where you, in fact, go for coffee -- you can select from a menu of cannabis products and light up in full view indoors or at a sidewalk table. It is the crowded, cloudy coffee shops that give Amsterdam its unmistakable summer aroma. The city is also home to countless seed shops, a hash and marijuana museum, and other businesses aimed at extracting cash from the peculiarly happy drug tourists. Things got a little complicated in 2008, when the Netherlands, as other countries, imposed restrictions on smoking in public places. A great battle ensued as coffee shop owners complained the ban would put them out of business. Dutch compromising ensued. So, today, you cannot smoke in most public establishments, but you can still smoke marijuana in a coffee shop. All non-medical drugs, to be clear, are illegal. But there are two categories. Cannabis and some types of "recreational mushrooms" are in a separate class; still illegal, but largely tolerated. The most powerful type of "magic mushrooms," containing psilocybin, were made illegal in 2008, but authorities say they will not prosecute anyone holding very small quantities. Hashish is also in a gray area, up to each municipality to decide. Not everyone likes this openness. Weed tourism is controversial in some circles and there are worries that lax laws attract more than just the tattoos and scraggly beard crowd, encouraging drug traffickers to enter the market. Weed aficionados across parts of the world panicked a couple of years ago when a conservative government announced plans to stem drug tourism, partly as a result of friction with neighboring countries. Under the new rules, coffee shops would issue membership cards, Weed Passes, only to local residents. Foreigners would not be able to come to the Netherlands to get high. But, as coffee shop owners admit, it's not the Dutch who are lighting up. Ninety percent of the customers getting buzzed in Amsterdam are foreigners. Amsterdam authorities complained the plan would take a huge financial toll, as millions of visitors every year inhale the offerings of coffee shop menus. After a very Dutch debate on the pros and cons of the plan, the government rewrote the law, leaving it up to each city to decide on the rules. Amsterdam scrapped it, while Maastricht, on the border with Germany and Belgium, left the ban in place and imposed fines on coffee shop owners defying the ban on pot sales to foreigners. So, to recap: No cigarette smoking in public; yes to pot in small quantities, but not in Maastricht, and mushrooms are OK in very small quantities. Today, pot smokers can be found meandering aimlessly along Amsterdam's famous Red Light district, the warren of alleyways and canals where prostitutes rent small rooms and stand in their windows, bathed in the light of red lamps before potential customers and sightseers. Policemen pedal easily alongside visitors, keeping an eye on the scene. Prostitution and brothels have been legal in the Netherlands since 2000. Prostitutes are supposed to have work permits and enjoy the protections of the country's labor laws. Another area of controversy in which the Dutch moved swiftly to the fore of social change is gay marriage. The Netherlands was the first country to fully legalize marriage equality. In 2001, the world's first same-sex ceremony was conducted by then-Amsterdam Mayor Job Cohen. You can't come to the Netherlands with your beloved to tie the knot, however: One of the partners has to be a Dutch resident. You can, however, share the city with the hundreds of thousands of Amsterdammers who ride their bicycles to and from work every day. The law does not require you to wear a helmet and practically no one does. You are, however, required to have a light and a bell on your bike. If you walk, make sure to stay out of the official bike lanes. If you choose to drive a car, it is illegal to use a mobile phone while you drive, and if you run into a bicycle, Dutch law places the responsibility on the driver of the car. So, if you go to a coffee shop, better not drive a car, or even a bicycle. Your friends are right. Lucky you if you've come to Amsterdam. It's a very special city. Whether or not you want to enjoy the freedom of Amsterdam, just remember there's much more to the Netherlands than coffee shops and red lights. And the Rijksmuseum is definitely worth a visit.  
http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/22/travel/art-fair-cities/index.html	travel	Five spectacular art fair cities - CNN.com	2013/05/22	Wednesday May 22 08:02:41 EDT 2013	Editor's note: "The City" is a CNN special series that profiles the sustainable urban future of five cities over five days. Watch the show every day during our special theme week starting Monday, Aug 19 on "World Business Today" at 1300 GMT and "Connect The World" at 2000 GMT. (CNN) -- If you're of the opinion that the only thing better than viewing great art is owning it, put these destinations on your travel itinerary. Not only are they cities renowned for their beauty, their museums and their architecture, they are the sites of the world's great art fairs. From ancient objects to art that was conceived yesterday, these carefully curated fairs offer the best of the best to their audiences. Attending one is like walking through a museum where everything is for sale -- to anyone with adequate funds. Yet even if you're not equipped to buy, you can still visit these fairs, take part in the spectacle and feed your aspirations. 5 train stations worth a stop Maastricht, The Netherlands Held annually in Maastricht, the European Fine Art Fair is the art fair by which all others are measured. "There is no other fair like it," says Lawrence Steigrad, a New York City fine art dealer who specializes in Old Master paintings. At the fair in March, he sold an 1810 painting by Dutch artist Nicolaas Baur to the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. That's the level of "shopper" who attends this fair: museum curators, serious collectors and those who aspire to be serious collectors. Calvin Klein and Kanye West are among those who have been spotted at the invitation-only preview day in recent years. They come because the quality and authenticity of every piece -- from antiquities to contemporary art -- undergoes what is acknowledged in the art world to be the strictest vetting process of any art fair. After the preview day, the fair is open to all. The ticket price is considerable, but the chance to see and possibly purchase such art, antiques and objects is extraordinary. The next fair takes place March 14-23, 2014, and there's talk of launching a TEFAF Beijing fair as well. Maastricht, in the southern Netherlands near Belgium, is known as a place where Amsterdam residents go for a weekend break. The cafes and restaurants around Vrijthof Square are lively and comfortable. Selexyz Dominicanen, housed in a former Dominican church, is one of the world's most beautiful bookstores, and the Bonnefantenmuseum is an excellent place to see art all year round. The places where masterpieces are born London Ever since its debut four years ago, Masterpiece London has been gaining a reputation as a mini-TEFAF. Installed in a specially built pavilion on the grounds of the Royal Hospital Chelsea in London, Masterpiece specializes in fine art, antiques and design, and adds luxury goods -- cars, yachts, watches and wines -- to the mix of offerings. Everything is vetted, everything is expensive, and Prince Harry was one of the VIP attendees in 2011. The list of exhibitors is hovering around 200 for this year's fair, which will take place June 26-July 3. Yet the even newer fair that everyone's talking about now is Frieze Masters, an adjunct to Frieze London, both of which will take place October 17-20. While Frieze London showcases contemporary art, Frieze Masters, which premiered in 2012, is for everything pre-21st-century. Last year's exhibitors included 90 international dealers; attendees included curators from around the world; and sales included ancient Mesopotamian artifacts, Renaissance marbles, a couple of Picassos and a Joan Mir painting with an eight-figure asking price. When you're in London, it's never hard to find great art to visit at the Victoria & Albert Museum, the Tate Modern the British Museum or the Royal Academy of Arts. Put the London Transport Museum on your list as well. Its "Poster Art 150 -- London Underground's Greatest Designs" exhibition (through October 27) features art that everyone can understand. Gatsby's Gold Coast: 8 grand estates Venice There are other biennial international art exhibitions, but when people talk about "the Biennale," they're talking about Venice. This being an odd-numbered year, the city is preparing the 55th Venice Biennale -- a nearly six-month-long festival (June 1 to November 24) with pavilions and art installations throughout the city. An architecture Biennale runs in even-numbered years. The Biennale seeps into every nook and cranny of the city, and the year won't be the only odd thing about it. For artists, the chance to represent their countries at the Venice Biennale can be a career-making moment. The path to greatness isn't easy, however, and neither is the art, which is typically conceptual, avant-garde and often (not to put too fine a point on it) just plain weird. Of the 88 nations represented by national pavilions, 10 are exhibiting for the first time. One is Bahamian artist Tavares Strachan whose installation includes a re-enactment of Robert Peary's 1909 expedition to the North Pole. The installation by Vincent J.F. Huang, representing Tuvalu (another first-time participant) involves suicidal penguins. Sarah Sze will represent the United States with an installation called "Triple Point." Chinese artist Ai Weiwei is one of four international artists who will create the installation in the German pavilion. At times, it can seem that the Biennale is inescapable. Whether that's good or bad depends on your taste. If, after seeing the newest of the new, you're longing for a cleansing immersion in classical or decorative art, the 11 museums of the Fondazione Musei Civici Venezia will satisfy you. Basel, Switzerland When it comes to art fairs that truly put their cities on the map, Art Basel tops the list. In 1970, three Basel gallery owners joined forces and invited their "gallerist" colleagues to Basel to exhibit the works of their current clients. Ninety galleries from 10 countries exhibited, more than 16,000 people attended, and with that one bold move, Basel became a modern and contemporary art pilgrimage destination. The 2012 Art Basel saw 300 galleries from 36 countries exhibiting and more than 65,000 curators and collectors attending. It's a happening -- and no one who's passionate about contemporary art would miss it. Art Basel is limited to 20th and 21st century art, and the emphasis is on the new. So, yes, you'll see Warhol and the occasional Leger, but you're more likely to encounter Cindy Sherman, Phyllida Barlow, Edward Ruscha, and Takashi Murakami among the offerings (and possibly among the attendees). In addition to the gallery exhibitors, there are installations of site-specific artworks open to the public free of charge in the Art Parcours section of the fair. The next Art Basel takes place June 13-16, 2013. With 40 museums to serve a population of around 165,000, Basel rightly claims the title of Switzerland's culture capital. Recently, Kunstmuseum Basel has been welcoming crowds for its excellent Picasso retrospective (through July 21). In nearby Weil am Rhein, Germany, the Vitra Design Museum is celebrating the work of American architect Louis Kahn (through August 11). Just as thrilling to locals and sports fans alike, the local soccer team, FC Basel, was the defending Swiss champion until they were defeated on Monday by Zurich-based club Grasshopper for the Swiss Cup title. Miami Beach, Florida It's not really cheating to include Art Basel Miami Beach on this list. Yes, the show is an offshoot of the original in Switzerland, but as it approaches its 12th year, Art Basel Miami Beach has earned its stripes in the art community -- and not merely because it gives everyone an excuse to visit Florida in the winter. (The even newer Art Basel Hong Kong kicks off its inaugural show this month, from May 23 to 26.) Held at the Miami Beach Convention Center, Art Basel Miami Beach features more than 200 exhibitors showcasing the work of some 4,000 artists and competition to be included is fierce -- close to 700 galleries applied to show at Art Basel Miami Beach last year. As at the original Art Basel, the focus here is on the new, but in Miami Beach, there's emphasis on artists and galleries from the United States and Latin America. The Art Nova and Art Positions sections of the fair showcase recent works, and young and emerging artists. The Art Public section, organized in cooperation with the Bass Museum of Art, places art installations in Collins Park. The next Art Basel Miami Beach takes place December 5-8. Miami and Miami Beach have a number of private art collections open to the public. The Rubell Family Collection is among the world's most respected private collections, featuring works by top 20th century artists and burgeoning contemporary artists. The Margulies Collection at the Warehouse includes works by Olafur Eliasson, Sol LeWitt, Willem de Kooning and Richard Serra. And in 2009, Carlos and Rosa de la Cruz opened the de la Cruz Collection Contemporary Art Space to showcase their collection of contemporary art.  
http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/30/travel/most-remote-islands/index.html	travel	World's 7 most dangerous and remote islands - CNN.com	2013/01/30	Wednesday Jan 30 12:55:19 EST 2013	(CNN) -- Idiotic TV shows and all the latest apps bumming you out on the 21st century? Ready for some "me time" on the world's remotest islands? Forget golden sands and swaying palms -- the reality of solitude is different as these terrifyingly distant landfalls demonstrate. Tristan da Cunha 
1,750 miles from South Africa The British island group of Tristan da Cunha stands profoundly alone in the South Atlantic. The nearest landfall is South Africa, 1,750 miles east, and to the west, South America is more than 2,000 miles. It's the world's most remote inhabited island chain -- so precariously occupied that when a volcanic vent erupted in 1961, the whole population was evacuated to England. Reaching Tristan da Cunha: This is no easygoing excursion. To quote the official website, "There are no package tours for independent travelers, no hotels, no airport, no holiday reps, no night clubs, no restaurants, no jet skis nor safe sea swimming." All visitors need to clear their arrivals in advance through the Island Council, and they also need to obtain a police certificate. (A 40-day wait is typical.) There are around 10 sailings a year from Cape Town, South Africa, and Namibia, each taking five to six days to reach the islands; it costs $800-$1,500 for a round trip. A list of available ships can be found on the official website: www.tristandc.com. Bear Island 
400 miles off Europe's north coast Bjornoya, better known as Bear Island, is the southernmost island in the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, 400 miles north of mainland Europe -- but only on paper, given that it's almost 150 miles south of the Norwegian island chain with which it's lumped. It's been a nature reserve since 2002 and has a lively history of failed occupation -- hard to believe for a place of barren cliffs, near-zero precipitation and risk of leaks of radioactive material from the nearby wreck of a nuclear submarine. Reaching Bear Island: Getting to the heart of Svalbard is a relatively simple matter -- there are daily flights from Oslo and Tromso to Svalbard's capital, Longyearbyen, on the west coast of Spitsbergen. Now it gets tricky. Research vessels infrequently call on Bear Island (the Norwegian Polar Institute makes an occasional appearance), while individually chartered boats and the occasional adventure cruise (such as this one from Polar Quest) haul in the remaining visitors. Bouvet 
1,000 miles from Antarctica Tristan da Cunha is the remotest inhabited island in the world -- now, welcome to its uninhabited, far bleaker counterpart. Its cliffs are sheer. It's almost entirely covered by a glacier. In winter, its seas are pack ice. And its nearest neighbor is Antarctica, 1,000 miles to the south. In short, idyllic. Reaching Bouvet: The entire island is a nature reserve -- so unless you can make a compelling case for visiting, you'll be blocked by Norwegian authorities. Get permission, and it's now a simple matter of finding a research vessel, quickly mastering a valuable skill such as arctic geological surveying or marine biology and then getting someone to land you via helicopter. (There are no ports or harbors.) If all else fails, try becoming an amateur radio enthusiast: In 1990, a multinational expedition of operators spent 16 days on the island. Bishop Rock 
30 miles from England Regarded by Guinness as the world's smallest island with a building on it, Bishop Rock stands at the end of Britain's Isles of Scilly, where coastal waters give way to the fury of the Atlantic. In 1847, engineers started building an iron lighthouse there -- and it washed away in a storm. Its extraordinary successor, first lit in 1858, stands to this day. Reaching Bishop Rock: Visiting the most southwesterly point in Britain is surprisingly easy -- the St. Mary's Boatsmen's Association runs day trips. But as Martin Hesp notes, even on a "calm" day you're in for serious chop. Boreray 
60 miles off mainland Scotland Love the Scottish islands, but want something with a little more bite? Head west of the Outer Hebrides, and you'll find the archipelago of St. Kilda, 40 miles into the Atlantic. It's one of Scotland's five World Heritage sites, with a main island that was abandoned in the 1930s when crops failed. Imagine the surprise of archaeologists when they found that one of the least hospitable islands, Boreray, was occupied in prehistoric times. Reaching Boreray: Since Boreray comes under the protection of the National Trust for Scotland, you need its permission to visit. Then? Lots of time and lots of luck -- with a rugged shoreline and savage sea swell, this isn't an island built for landings. According to one guide, more people have reached the summit of Everest than have landed at Boreray since the National Trust took ownership in 1957. North Sentinel Island 400 miles from Myanmar North Sentinel is one of the 572 islands making up the Andaman chain in the Indian Ocean's Bay of Bengal. It's surrounded by dangerous reefs, but North Sentinel is intimidating because of its inhabitants. The Sentinelese want nothing to do with the modern world and have repeatedly rebuffed attempts to make peaceful contact. Reaching North Sentinel Island: You're kidding, right? If the above description didn't put you off, this article about a pair of fishermen who strayed onto the island certainly should. Rockall 
270 miles from Ireland If you think Boreray sounds forbidding, try sailing 187 miles west of it. Rockall is the tip of an extinct volcano reaching 20 meters (about 65 feet) above sea level, in seas with waves recorded as high as 29 meters (95 feet). In 1955, the British Empire, in its final territorial acquisition, seized Rockall -- allegedly due to fears the Soviets would build a missile battery on it. Reaching Rockall: In the words of the recently minted Rockall Club, "visiting Rockall is difficult, completely weather dependent and not cheap." Your best bet is contacting Kilda Cruises and arranging a tailor-made excursion. Or you could sail there, lash yourself to the rock and claim it as your very own micronation -- but you wouldn't be the first.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/28/living/parents-adoption-older-kids-photo-shoot/index.html	living	Giving older kids in foster care a new look for adoption - CNN.com	2014/04/28	Monday Apr 28 11:24:56 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. She is a mom of two. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter.  (CNN) -- At 16, Deon just about stopped dreaming. The teen, born and raised mainly in Yakima, Washington, has been in and out of foster care since he was 5. Every time it looked like he might finally be adopted and find a permanent home, his hopes were dashed. "You start to feel numb and depressed," said Deon, admitting that last year he "kind of gave up" ever thinking a family would want him. "You lose hope ... and you think ... I have a few more years to go of this. What's going to happen to me?" he said during an interview. At 18, children in foster care essentially age out of the system. State agencies might offer them services such as job skills training or help building resumes, but they ultimately need to find a way to take care of themselves. "It's pretty frightening for them because they really are just pretty much on their own," said Amber Louis, Recruitment and Outreach Specialist for the Northwest Adoption Exchange in Seattle. An idea is born  While Deon was giving up, Jennifer Loomis, an acclaimed maternity and family photographer, was getting curious. A friend of hers had adopted a child. Since she and her boyfriend of four years didn't have any kids, she thought they should consider adopting as well. So, she went online, visiting sites that showcased children to adopt. "I was so blown away by how bad the photos were that I thought, 'Oh my God, these photos don't show these kids at all,' " said Loomis. "I can't get a sense of who these kids are." READ: Teen orphan's impassioned speech: 'Adopt me' As someone who tries to give back to her community as much as possible, Loomis thought surely she could carve out a couple of days to do a free photo shoot to create better pictures for the children. "And so I sent an e-mail that night ... I said, 'Hi, this is really random but I'm a photographer in Seattle and I was looking through your site and I really feel like you guys need better photos,' " she told me with a laugh, remembering the directness of her note. Amber Louis of the Northwest Adoption Exchange received Loomis' e-mail and jumped at the opportunity. "I see so many kids with photos that just don't do them justice," said Louis. "I think any photo that we can put together that shows their personality a little bit more is really helpful. ... I think it also increases the likelihood that an adoptive parent is going to stop and take a look when they are just scrolling through the pages of photos." Strike a pose  Loomis teamed up with another photographer, Rocky Salskov, and received donations from friends and clients, including food, balloons, even a small trampoline, to use for the photo shoot. The goal? To show the "sensitive, vulnerable side of these kids," said Loomis. "I wanted photos where you could look into their eyes and see into their soul a little bit better, where you could be like, 'Wow, Deon, what a guy,' " she said. READ: International adoptions decline as number of orphans grows Deon was one of seven children in foster care, from age 9 through 17, chosen for the two-day photo shoot. "I got really into it. I started posing, and there was one part where they had the trampoline there and that was so fun. You jump up in the air and strike a pose," he said. "It was really, really cool." Louis said she had targeted kids like Deon who she thought needed new photos. "You just cross your fingers and hope that ... a photo will catch (someone's) eye and they'll inquire." 'A burning thing in my heart' Joanna Church of Oak Harbor, Washington, which is on Whidbey Island, remembers being at a church service as a young girl, and hearing about how children are less likely to be adopted as they get older and how older children in foster care are at greater risk for homelessness and incarceration once they age out of the foster care system. They are also at greater risk of unemployment, pregnancy and suffering from poor health, according to research. "And so from a really young age ... it just was a burning thing in my heart that I just knew it was something I wanted to do someday," said Church, who works with the Canadian National Defense and helps military families living on Whidbey Island. After trying for some time to have biological children, Church approached her husband, Sean Vaillancourt, a sonar operator for the Canadian Navy, with the idea of adopting an older child in the foster care system. Vaillancourt remembers feeling unsure about whether they should take such a life-changing step. READ: Bringing Richard home, the story of a crowd-funded adoption  "I was nervous going into it because you just don't know what you're about to get ... like, 'Am I going to be borrowing trouble? Am I going to be a good father?' " said Vaillancourt. After thinking about how much they had in their lives and how much they could give back, he decided to go forward but remained anxious. Sparkly, happy eyes With her husband's support, Church headed online to look for children hoping for a home. She saw Deon's picture on a different website and went right past it, she said. 'It wasn't a good picture. It was grainy. ... It did not capture me at all." But when she saw Deon on the Northwest Adoption Exchange website, which showcased the pictures that Loomis and Salskov had taken, she stopped. "You saw ... personality in the face, like you saw it coming off the page, and it was enough to get us to stop and open that profile and look at it, and want to get to know Deon better," said Church. When I asked her what she saw in those pictures, she said Deon's "sparkly happy eyes." OPINION: Why adoption jokes hurt  Amber Louis remembers the phone call. "When I heard that there was this family interested, I kept my fingers and toes crossed," she said. Photographer Loomis, who is due to give birth in July, smiled when she heard the news. "This is exactly what I hoped for even though I wasn't sure it would happen. Photographs can be really powerful when they are authentic and genuine." When Deon learned a family was interested in him, he was excited but his guard remained up. "I thought it was too good to be true because I've had that happen to me where I'd go for a little bit and then I'd come back, and so the fact that somebody actually wants me is pretty cool." In October, Deon moved into Joanna and Sean's home and then they started the process of adopting him. They expect his adoption to become final next week and are planning a big family party to celebrate. Joanna and Sean are also helping Deon get Canadian citizenship, because they will be moving to Victoria, British Columbia in August. No matter where they live, they say they are committed to making sure Deon remains connected with his biological family, including a great grandmother who has been his primary care provider throughout this life. "They've really given me a new look on life," said Deon, referring to Joanna and Sean. "Instead of feeling just like that I'm all alone, I actually feel like I have somebody there for me." "I think that's the most rewarding thing is just trying to be there for somebody else," said Vaillancourt. Raising awareness  Church has become a passionate advocate for children in foster care, hoping her story will help raise awareness about how many kids are waiting for homes and how life-changing adoption can be for them. As of November of last year, there were nearly 400,000 children in the United States in foster care. "There's just such a need, there (are) just so many great kids out there," she said. READ: Overseas adoptions rise -- for black American children  To people who might be afraid to adopt an older child thinking they will come with grown-up issues to contend with, Church argues that biological children come with big question marks, too. "Well, you just don't know what kind of kid you're going to get," she said people tell her. "And my response is always, you (don't) know what kind of kid you're going to get when you birth them." Saving a life  For Church's husband, the experience is all about giving a kid a chance. "We've all had our chances, from our parents, from somebody looking out for us, and these (kids) have nobody looking out for them," said Vaillancourt. Before the couple decided to adopt Deon, he didn't do that well in school and thought the military might be his only option. Now his grades are up, and he's running track for his high school, learning to drive, getting excited to travel to Canada and thinking about other careers, including one in the military. "We get the privilege of helping a kid discover who he is, what he likes, what his strengths are and what he can be truly passionate about in life," said Church in a follow-up e-mail. When you give someone a chance, it can change their life forever, Deon said.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/06/living/other-mothers-relate-irpt/index.html	living	Mother's Day praise for our 'other mothers' - CNN.com	2014/05/06	Tuesday May 6 12:05:24 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- I had absolutely no right to cry over the death of Mrs. Howard. She wasn't family, and I hadn't seen her in more than 20 years. That didn't stop me from crumpling onto the couch and howling like a kitten hurled from a moving car when I heard the news last year. Between the damp, snotty sobs, I wracked my brain to figure out why word of Mrs. Howard's death had struck me so squarely. I hadn't kept in touch with my mother's friend once I'd graduated from high school and fled my unhappy hometown life. I poked at the space her loss had left, like examining the socket where a tooth was once firmly lodged. She'd had a dog, Piper, of which I was quite fond. She'd let me practice my piano lessons on her electric organ, and that was awfully nice. She'd taken me to the mother-daughter Girl Scout dinner...oh... That was the raw nerve causing the ache. She'd filled in during at least one of many school-sanctioned mother-daughter outings when my mom was unable. It's what lots of sisters, aunts, friends, neighbors, teachers do when they see a child in need of care and comfort. And Mrs. Howard did it for me. My mother was and is unwell in ways I do and do not understand. It has been this way as long as I can remember. It's not her fault; and it just simply is. And so I've been blessed with women -- like Mrs. Howard, my mother's twin sister and my own sister -- who gracefully slipped in to fill the cracks as much as I'd let them. I never asked these women to step in -- mothers hold a vaunted role in our social structure, and you go with the one you're given. No matter your circumstance, as a daughter it can sometimes feel like a betrayal to seek the care of another woman. One of the subtle gifts these other mothers give is making it so a child -- of any age -- never has to ask. When a child's struggles and scars are visible, sympathy is the immediate impulse. I recall walking past a classroom where our gentle-voiced hummingbird of a homeroom teacher was showing my friend Melissa how to sew buttons on shirts. She had lost her brother and her mother to cancer in the course of a few, cruel years. While we, Melissa's friends, fumbled for the words and actions that wouldn't rip the wound wider, an army of women knit themselves around the motherless girl to bear her into womanhood as best they could. While none of them could ever fully mend the ragged edge left by the loss of her mother, these women taught Melissa to cook and sew and shop for bras and inhabit the turbulent body of a girl entering adolescence. And over time, one of them finally fell so deeply into the rhythms of care, she became a permanent part of the family -- as Melissa's stepmother. A childhood friend I'll call Janet, so far as she would have any of us believe, sprung fully formed from the earth and as hard as bedrock around the heart. Her mother had bailed on the family when Janet was a very small child, leaving a weird and wounded pair behind in the rubble. But where Janet toughened, her father crumbled, and suddenly at some point in our teenage years, home wasn't a safe and stable place for her to be. Knowing she'd never ask, our friend Tina's mother simply made an executive decision: Janet, you live here with us now. There are rules to our home and you will follow them, but now it is your home, too. When iReporter Shawn Fontenot Yujuico was 17, she and her mother were hit head-on by a drunken driver. She survived, but her mother did not. To add insult to grievous injury, Yujuico and her brothers were sent to live with her father and stepmother, Shirley Fontenot, with whom she'd always clashed. "My mother's death made it hard to accept my stepmother. My younger brothers and I did the classic 'You are not my mom' routine, and we compared the two of them endlessly," she writes. Fontenot had three children of her own from a previous marriage and could have concentrated all her affection on them and her husband. Instead, she and Yujuico's father did something extraordinary for the sake of their blended family: they remained married, but moved into separate houses to raise their children until all of them had graduated and moved out. Yujuico explains, "They managed to get together on weekends here and there. And from time to time, they brought us all together and we began to soften. She just flat out loved us. She loved us over our brattiness, our 'You are not Mother,' over our heartbreak. She didn't love us conditionally, she loved us with her whole heart." And years later, when Yujuico asked Fontenot why and how she'd found the strength to embrace angry stepchildren who were shoving her away at every turn, her answer was simple: "Because you were children and I was a grownup. That's what grownups are supposed to do. I knew you were hurting." But the need isn't always so clear-cut. iReporter Heather Gornick Jorgensen and her brother were fed, warm and clothed -- but hunger isn't always a physical thing. Their teenage mother was still going about the business of growing up, herself, when they were born. While her children's biological needs were met, Jorgensen's mother simply didn't yet have the level of maturity necessary to sustain the souls of her children, too. Her maternal grandmother, Toni, took the nurturing role. "The most important lesson I learned from my grandmother is that every child deserves unconditional love," writes Jorgensen. "While I was filled with insecurities and doubts, she was the one person who made me feel like I was perfect exactly as I was." Now in her 80s, Jorgensen's grandmother has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and Jorgensen is terrified -- of losing one of the most important people in her life and also of her suffering. She is also ready to return the favor, love and lessons her other mother taught her throughout the years. "I am grateful for the remaining opportunity I have to tell her that I love her, too," Jorgensen said. "Unconditionally." And this Sunday, I will send my own mother flowers, with a note telling her that I love her, and thanking her for all that she has done for me. She is my mother, and that's what a daughter does on Mother's Day. But that won't be the only bouquet I send.

In 2013, for the first time since 1960, a new name unseated Michael or Jacob as the most popular for newborn boys. That's according to the Social Security Administration, which releases the list of most popular baby names each year. The new king's name? Noah. Sophia held the top spot for girls for the third year in a row, though Sofia with an "f" is crawling up the list: The latter reached its highest spot ever, at No. 13, the Social Security Administration said. Parents submit their babies' names when applying for Social Security numbers when the children are born. The names tend to reflect pop culture's influence on trends. The fastest riser for girls in 2012 was Arya, the name of a beloved character in the "Game of Thrones" series on HBO. In 2013, Jayceon and Daleyza made the biggest jumps in popularity in the top 1,000. Jayceon rose from 1,051 to 206 from 2012 to 2013, while Daleyza leaped from 3,715 to 585. The fastest riser for boys, Jayceon, is the birth name of the rapper known as The Game. He has a reality series on VH1, "Marrying The Game," which follows his life as a rapper and father of three. The show premiered in late 2012 and started having an effect on naming trends last year, the agency said. Daleyza's rise might have resulted from the influence of a popular Spanish-language reality TV series, "Larrymania," which airs on mun2, the agency said. Daleyza is the young daughter of Larry Hernandez, an American regional Mexican singer who's the star of the show. Rounding out the Top 10 names for boys were Liam, Jacob, Mason, William, Ethan, Michael, Alexander, Jayden and Daniel. The other top names for girls were Emma, Olivia, Isabella, Ava, Mia, Emily, Abigail, Madison and Elizabeth. Would you pick any of the names in the Top 10 lists?

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/01/living/promposal-pressure-proms/index.html	living	'Promposal' pressure intense for teens - CNN.com	2014/05/01	Thursday May 1 10:25:46 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Abby Rodgers walked out to her date's car and found roses, a teddy bear and a card sitting in the passenger's seat. Inside the card was the million-dollar question: Will you go to prom with me? The 17-year-old high school senior was touched. Everyone at her all-girls private school in suburban Philadelphia was hoping for some sort of "promposal," the act of inviting someone to prom in an elaborate fashion, often involving props, dancing flash mobs or maybe even police or actor Bryan Cranston. In the moment, Rodgers said yes, "because it was such a nice gesture and he was so sweet and brave to go through with it." Later that evening, when she had a chance to process what had happened, she realized she didn't actually want to go with him. "I realized that prom is more of a couples atmosphere," she said. "I didn't want to be there with someone I was not in a close relationship with." While prom is a great excuse to dress up, party with friends and mark the passage of another school year, the annual rite of passage also carries a lot of pressure -- to look perfect, arrive in style and have the ideal date on your arm. Promposals can add to the pressure, becoming almost as important as prom itself and raising expectations for young men and women, especially when they get posted on social media for all to see. Sure, some promposals can be thoughtful, charming or downright heartwarming. They can teach teens to take healthy risks and nurture their romantic side in the hookup-culture era. But, as with anything, it's all about intention. "As promposals have become more elaborate and public, so, too, does the potential for increased humiliation and social pressure," said Jarrod Chin, director of training and curriculum of Northeastern University Sport in Society, a nationwide youth mentoring program that focuses on violence prevention and healthy relationships. "As promposal clips go viral, more and more young people think that you need to create these elaborate schemes to ask someone to prom and the reality is that it should be just a fun event for young people to dance and celebrate." Going all out and all in What used to be a potentially awkward phone call or hallway conversation is becoming an extremely public ceremony with high stakes. For some girls (and, even some boys), not getting a promposal is their worst nightmare. And yet, being approached with flowers in the hallway can be a letdown, especially if a friend was serenaded in a flash mob. For others, these grandiose public gestures put invitees on the spot, forcing them to accept even if they don't want to for fear of being perceived as mean or stuck up. Opinion: The damaging message of proms Boys also face pressure to be creative and do whatever it takes to get a yes. That's the whole point, after all. Sometimes, the effort comes from a genuine desire to make the invitee happy and have fun doing it. Other times, the point really is to force a yes. Massachusetts high school senior Sam Casey has seen it go both ways. Friends in relationships have staged promposals for the fun of it. He's also seen classmates do them in front of invitees' families to get a yes where they probably would not have received one otherwise. "It takes a lot for a guy to put himself out there for a girl, and they want to do everything they can to make sure they're not humiliated," he said. "By doing it in a special way, or publicly showing that he really wants to go with that person, 99% of the time the girl will say yes." Either way, it can be a source of stress for both sides, Casey said. "I think it's gotten to the point that if you don't do it, you'll have a hard time finding a date," he said. If the answer is no, the emotional fallout can be damaging, Chin said. Programs such as Sport in Society's Mentors in Violence Prevention work with teens nationwide on how to have mature conversations with potential love interests and how to deal with a breakup or rejection. "If their identity could potentially be challenged by a 'no' to prom, we need to provide young men with the skills and ability to handle what could be a really embarrassing and traumatic public refusal," Chin said. That's where parents and adults come in, he said, to talk about realistic expectations around prom dating in general. "As adults, we shouldn't minimize promposals or teen relationships as puppy love or harmless crushes," he said. "Instead, we should view (them) as the first steps in developing intimate relationships, and how they handle them sets the stage for more complicated situations, like long-term dating, breakups, marriage and divorce." Testing the waters Not all promposals are bad or ill-intentioned. To avoid potential embarrassment or hurt feelings, teens often put out feelers among friends to see if their potential date is interested. In best-case scenarios, the person knows what's coming; it's just a matter of how and when, said University of Pennsylvania freshman Ria Desai. "I didn't feel any pressure to say yes because I already knew he was going to ask me," said Desai, who accepted a promposal in 2012 from a close friend during dance class. "In that way it was fun because I didn't know how he was going to ask me; it was a surprise." Promposals get iffy when the other person has no clue as to what's coming, she said. In those situations, some girls say yes in the moment but then later turn down the guy in private. The alternative of public rejection can be worse for the girl, Desai wrote in a 2012 blog post for SPARK Summit, a girl-fueled activist movement that challenges media portrayals of women. "Turning him down marks her as a 'huge bitch,' a label she doesn't deserve in any way. Yes, rejecting him will hurt his feelings, but doesn't every girl deserve the chance to make the decision that she wants to make?" she wrote. Further raising the stakes, though, is the "necessity" of capturing the event as a picture or video so it can be shared on social media, said Ohio State University freshman Melinda Vercollone, whose 2013 promposal came in the form of a "prom" sign underneath the hood of a friend's car. Her twin sister got asked when a boy showed up at their home shirtless on a moped with roses in his mouth while his friends filmed the whole thing. "The filming was important; it's sort of a necessity to put something on Facebook or Instagram so everyone will know who asked who and when and how. It's also critical that everyone watches the video so the next boy doesn't accidentally copy a proposal that has already been done," Vercollone said. "I remember being so happy that I was asked to prom, but also so disappointed that no one had been there to see it or to take a cute picture of us and post it on Facebook." The pressure to couple up Rodgers, the suburban Philadelphia teen, has nothing against promposals, especially among friends and couples. They have great potential to be sweet or thoughtful when done the right way. That's what caught her off guard about her date's promposal. They knew each other through mutual friends, but she knew in her heart that she did not want to bring someone she was not serious about to prom. She discovered this at her junior prom, when she brought a guy she didn't know well because she didn't want to be the only person without a date. They didn't really hit it off. "I realized I would rather go alone or with my friends," she said. This year, Rodgers faced pressure from various corners to bring someone. Even her grandparents offered to attempt to set her up with a busboy from their favorite restaurant. "It's almost taboo at my school to go alone." Inspired by a friend who decided not to bring a date, Rodgers texted her date two weeks after his promposal and told him she changed her mind. He took it well, she said, and he found another date for his prom. Rodgers ended up going to hers without a date last week. She had a great time dancing and posing for pictures with her friends, including others who went alone. "It was amazing. I have no regrets," she said. "To girls who get promposed to and don't know what to do, I would just say you only have one prom. Think about what's going to make you happy and remain true to who you are."  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/15/living/intersex-dating-relate/index.html	living	Intersex intimacy: Busting myths and finding love - CNN.com	2014/04/15	Tuesday Apr 15 01:02:45 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- There's a vocabulary of protection used around the intersex community -- of "escape" from sex assignment surgery to normalize their genitals, of PTSD and survivorship, of guilt from some whose bodies remain intact. There's also a shared experience of shame, secrecy and disconnection borne of being treated like a physical mistake. They arrived in the world with genetic mutations that affect them at intimate levels, and were taught to believe, often since birth, that their very existence is a condition that needs to be corrected. The path to romantic connection with another human can feel isolated and impassible. The risk, impossible. But it doesn't have to be. Activists like Bo Laurent, Jim Ambrose and Pidgeon Pagonis have made it their mission to guide people with intersex traits and differences of sex development, known as DSD, toward understanding their own worth in the world. They're demanding visibility and justice in a culture that has long mythologized, marginalized and misunderstood their bodies. And some of them are hoping to find love with someone who truly sees them. "It's hard for people to wrap their head around what exactly is going on. It gets everywhere -- it's nothing but sprawl. It's not limited to the bedroom," says Ambrose, a writer and the co-founder of The Interface Project, a site that collects and shares personal stories of people living with an intersex condition or DSD. So let's start in the classroom with a quick lesson on what intersex is not: transgender, though the two are often erroneously lumped together or the "hermaphrodite" of lore and porn, possessed of fully functioning (and physically impossible) male and female genitalia. It's also not especially uncommon. A visible difference of sexual anatomy occurs in 1 out of every 1,500 to 2,000 births, according to statistics from the World Health Organization. Medically speaking, intersex is defined as a congenital anomaly of the reproductive and sexual system. Katrina Karkazis, a senior research scholar at the Center for Biomedical Ethics at Stanford University, says that in most cases, people have a genetic mutation that affects development of sex organs. This might be evident at birth, later in life or not at all. For example, in the case of people with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, these women have XY chromosomes and testes. Their bodies produce testosterone, but because their bodies don't respond to it, the genitalia don't masculinize, and they don't develop masculine secondary sex characteristics such as increased muscle mass, a deeper voice and facial hair. "They have XY chromosomes and testes and you wouldn't know that at birth because they are born with female genitalia," Karkazis says. From the 1950s until recently, parents of babies born with atypical or ambiguous genitalia were generally presented one option: genital surgery. This is most often done to present the child as female because of doctors' beliefs that it's an easier outcome to achieve with available medical techniques. This often entails surgeries to remove testes, reduce organs that might present as a small phallus or an outsized clitoris, or add a vaginal cavity. To parents -- shocked and confused by anatomy they don't understand, and envisioning a life of otherness and romantic rejection for their newborn -- surgery to "normalize" can seem like the most loving course of action. In 1957, intersex rights pioneer Bo Laurent was born into a world of confusion. Medical professionals were "in a state of shock" for three days, unable to determine what sex she was, and her mother was kept sedated. Laurent was eventually labeled a boy, and her parents were dismissed from the hospital, unable to seek additional child care, lest their secret get out. When she was 1 years old, another doctor decided to change her sex assignment so she could be raised as a girl. "They performed a clitorectomy and they told my parents to move to another town and not tell anyone where they went and never tell me what happened," Laurent says. "All those things were so traumatizing, frightening and pain-producing for my parents that it made it hard for them to relate normally to me." Alienated from her parents, withdrawn from her peers and deeply disconnected from her medically numbed and scarred body, Laurent avoided romantic and intimate connection with partners well into her 20s. Then, she started to seek answers. The discovery of her intersex status finally offered a path into the world. Over the course of the past two decades, with her work as an activist, speaker and founder of the now-defunct Intersex Society of North America, Laurent has led others on a journey to connect body and soul -- their own and others'. "One of the things I'm proud of is that I think that I've helped to provide frameworks to talk about it, narratives that are now available to other people," Laurent says. 'Unequivocal visibility' Jim Ambrose is one of the people Laurent helped. Though he'd been surgically assigned as female as a baby, furthered by hormones and by additional surgeries his late teens, Ambrose, now 37, vividly recalls how different he felt from the other girls, even at an early age. "I remember the first girl in my class wearing a bra and I reacted exactly as every other boy in the class did," he says. "I was enamored and fascinated." Unconsciously, he knew that the interest didn't spring from girl-to-girl solidarity or a glimpse at his future. Watching a school-mandated sex-ed film about menstruation, he thought, "I don't think this is ever going to happen to me." It didn't, of course. Ambrose's mother disclosed the reason when he was 12 and estrogen treatments soon followed. Neither did he experience the sexual connections his peers were making. At 16, Ambrose -- still perceived as female by his peers -- had a girlfriend ("by default," he jokes, rather than a drive to romantically bond). He studiously kept her away from his intimate parts. In retrospect, it was out of self-protection. While the girlfriend never argued, she did confess to mutual friends that the distance "weirded her out." Word got back to Ambrose, and he was suddenly painfully aware that while he felt a deep detachment from his female-assigned body, it was no longer just of interest to his parents and doctors. It was now of interest to his peers -- and his future sexual partners. After all, that's what it had been surgically constructed for. "The guiding principle was pair-bonding with a man and to be even more specific, to make sure that I possessed a proper vessel for an erect penis," Ambrose says. "The end goal wasn't that I would be a sexually satisfied woman, or a person who was curious about other forms of sexuality. ... My personal sexual pleasure wasn't taken into account." Stanford's Karkazis sees this all too frequently in her work and friendships with members of the intersex community. "Imagine for a moment that you want to connect with someone sexually, and you feel nothing sexual in your genitalia. Or you feel pain. I know people who have tried everything under the sun and have even contemplated more surgery. Imagine this kind of searching," Karkazis says. "The door is closed before it's even opened. You can think you're so damaged that no one will be satisfied with you." But after Ambrose struck up a friendship with Laurent, he used her framework of disclosure to amplify attempts at connection. A sympathetic and proactive doctor agreed with him that the removal of breasts and vaginoplasty were medically necessary -- and the way to correct a wrong that had been done to him by the medical community. She started him on a regimen of compounded testosterone cream to correct bone density deficits that occurred when he stopped taking estrogen. While he hadn't consciously considered transitioning to a more male-presenting body before then, his physical response to the hormones was undeniable. "Almost immediately, I felt a difference," Ambrose recalls. "It's like when a hunter is walking slowly through the woods and he steps on a branch and it cracks and the deer pops its head up to see what's going on. What? What was that? My body was telling me, 'Hey, this shit is good. Let's do this. We're into this.' " A year later, when he was in his late 20s, he began taking testosterone injections and presenting as male in public. His psyche and body were more aligned than they had ever been before, and he had been dating women all along, but the transition ushered in a whole new set of insecurities. Ambrose says, "I was a man who didn't have the penis that everyone was going to expect. And by 'everybody' I mean that I was really focused on dating straight women. I wanted to date women who were going to desire me as a man. ... I wanted a woman to see me from across the room and say 'Yeah, I want to f*** that guy,' before they knew anything about me." He adopted Laurent's technique of presenting his story honestly and early, telling prospective partners, "I work at this bookstore, but mostly I do advocacy work and it sends me around the country and I organize and do workshops and I sit on committees and I do fundraising for this little organization and ... why do I do that? Well, because it happened to me." And it worked. A lot. Date after date after date was "a rousing success," according to Ambrose. "It puts me in a position of somebody who is being proactive about their life. One who is acting in defense of myself and others," he says. "To couch it that way informs the listener -- often a potential sexual partner -- that I care what you think, but I know enough about myself to know that if you want to perceive me as a victim, cry for me, be disgusted by me or get up and leave, you can do all of those things. "My happiness, self-awareness and ability to get up in the morning doesn't hinge on whether you want me to go home with you tonight." While Ambrose's most recent long-term relationship ended a few months ago, he grows increasingly comfortable in the body he now has, and steadfast in his attempts at romantic connection with the right woman. "I think there is a resilience gene. There are so many times when I could have packed it in, or subsisted on scraps. Or I could have chosen girlfriends who were bad for me or cruel or abusive, but I didn't," Ambrose says. "I need for them to see me as plainly and clearly as they possibly can. I need unequivocal visibility from my sexual partner." 'Tickling is my hurrah' Pidgeon Pagonis sought intimacy and found pain in its place. (Pagonis identifies as neither male nor female and uses the gender-neutral pronouns "they," "them" and "their" to describe themselves.) "I'm really persuaded by things, like the idea of what high school should be. I really wanted a high school experience and part of that was dating a boy and having sex with that boy," says Pagonis, now 28. At age 11, Pagonis was told that the genital surgery they had received as a child was to treat cancer, and the one they were about to receive was to fix a urine drip issue. In fact, the latter was to insert a vaginoplasty. At 16, Pagonis was dismayed by difficulty and pain during attempts at intercourse with a boyfriend. "I'd never had any dilation (which would have kept the passage open), so it was just a shock to my body. I left that moment being like 'That really hurt!' " Pagonis says. "But Cosmo (magazine) said it would get better. It didn't get better in terms of pleasure, but it got better in terms of not hurting as much every single time." Still, Pagonis soon came to associate almost any intimacy, including kissing, with the impending pain of penetration, and found any desire evaporate the moment they were touched. Alcohol and marijuana offered some distance from the ache, but ushered in a host of other issues, including a cycle of abusive partners and vulnerability to sexual assaults while blackout drunk. "I wanted to be so drunk that sex felt OK. I thought I'd feel less reserved and that sex would feel good. You strive to be normal when you know you're not normal. Instead of talking it through, I would just drink," Pagonis says. After a college professor lectured on the topic of intersex traits and DSD to a "psychology of women" class, something clicked. Pagonis walked across the street from their classroom at DePaul University, down into the hospital basement where, coincidentally, their own medical records were kept. There, Pagonis ripped open the shroud of shame and secrecy that had swaddled their body since the first surgery. The terms were unfamiliar -- "male pseudohermaphrodite" and "46 XY" -- but suddenly, so much made sense. Their mother confirmed and, after throwing their phone at the wall, Pagonis vowed to tell no one. But souls are loud and determined things. They seek and reach for connection despite all our best attempts at muffling them. Six months after the revelation, Pagonis started dating a woman to whom they disclosed the diagnosis. While the alignment of anatomy threw their physical differences into sharp relief -- "I still don't think my high school boyfriend knows I didn't have a clitoris," Pagonis likes to joke -- alternatives to penetrative sex opened up a whole new realm of connection. "These elements of intimacy are what I needed at the time," Pagonis says. "Tickling is my hurrah!" For now, the muting of sexual pleasure from the result of surgery and sexual trauma has proved a barrier to romantic pairing. Pagonis is flying solo, and attempting to find peace and pleasure in their own body with the help of a therapist. " 'Sex is 90% fiction and 10% friction!' " Pagonis quotes the therapist. "That stuck with me because when I was with people, I was always having fiction in my head and I thought this is because I'm messed up and I can't just get off from the person." Pagonis relies on wise words from Laurent, too. "She told me, 'Who cares? Think about whatever you need to. It's in your head and you're not hurting anybody. If you can get off, then good for you.' " "I let the shame of having a different body and not looking 'normal,' debilitate me," Pagonis says. "I needed that permission and Bo gave it to me." 'Love is like jumping off a cliff' Pagonis now works as Advocates for Informed Choice's youth leadership coordinator and a teen dating violence prevention coordinator, and firmly believes that doctors' and parents' lack of disclosure to intersexed children is as harmful as cosmetic surgery to conceal the physical differences. "If people would just be honest and talk to you about your body, you might still make the same decisions, but I might not have -- and I would have had someone to talk to and make healthier, safer choices," Pagonis says. Ambrose agrees: "I have yet to meet a parent who was intentionally trying to hurt their child. I have as much sympathy for my parents and my friends' parents as I do us. You perform these surgeries aimed to 'normalize' a child and then you expect the child to be quiet and not talk to anyone about it. You're going to color every aspect of the child's life, and your life." And at 57, Laurent herself is still learning the boundaries of her own worth and wonder. After the end of her marriage and a period of being single, she decided to try again, and was shocked to find herself loved and loving once more. Laurent found herself opening her heart to a younger woman who she met online and who had never heard of intersex conditions. "She wasn't familiar with those words or the story, but I did tell her about the clitorectomy. I was surprised and comforted at how well she took that," Laurent says. For all the people who Laurent has rowed to safety in her years of advocacy, it was a personal risk for her, and this woman could see that. She reached across the distance between them. As they were becoming more serious, she sent Laurent a quote she still remembers. "It read: 'Love is like jumping off a cliff,' " Laurent says.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/01/living/unmarried-companion-death-relate/index.html	living	When a boyfriend dies, does the grief mean less? - CNN.com	2014/04/01	Tuesday Apr 1 11:37:26 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- When Chris Doheny met Sarah Fox, he was uncharacteristically hopeful about the future -- a successful double lung transplant in June 2010 to help with his cystic fibrosis meant things were looking up, Fox says. She was also hopeful; Fox had recently been on the "the worst Internet date of all time" when she met the Georgetown University grad at a concert through mutual friends. But after two years of dating Fox, Doheny, 31, died in February 2013 due to complications from cystic fibrosis. "We had talked about a future, and I think that Chris knew more than I did that we didn't have one," Fox says. "I was maybe a little nave." Fox has one word to describe Doheny's death: devastating. Unmarried companions can face the same grief and desolation that a husband or wife does at the loss of a partner. But the suffering of a girlfriend or boyfriend may be minimized by others, who assume it shouldn't last so long or hurt so deeply -- as in, "Well, he was only your boyfriend." Fox says the "girlfriend" label has been a particular struggle after Doheny's death: "What do I call him now? He's not my ex-boyfriend because we never broke up, but he's also not my boyfriend." Fox recalls a co-worker telling her: "At least now you can move on and find someone else." Nancy Berns, a sociology professor at Drake University and author of "Closure: The Rush to End Grief and What It Costs Us," advises against starting any statement of sympathy with "at least." "They think they're trying to help by minimizing the pain, but it doesn't affirm that you're hurting -- and that I respect that you're hurting," Berns says. During Doheny's period of declining health, Fox sought out a grief counselor who specialized in dealing with a spousal death as the best viable option -- a step, she calls, "extremely helpful" as "it was very stressful to watch him deteriorate." Berns says grief is a normal, healthy response to a loss no matter the relationship, and things get murky if the depth of grieving becomes connected to how long a relationship endured or whether it was legally binding. She added that our culture also needs to eliminate the notion that grief ends. What's more helpful is learning to live with a loss: "Grieving helps us identify what we lost and express the love that we had." Losing a unmarried partner in the public eye can mean a greater level of scrutiny and a heightened set of expectations. The public wonders how a celebrity will respond to such a loss -- recent examples include Lea Michele after the death of her boyfriend and "Glee" co-star Cory Monteith and Mick Jagger and deceased fashion designer L'Wren Scott. In her first televised appearance after Monteith's death, Michele dedicated her Teen Choice Award to him. "For all of you out there who loved and admired Cory as much as I did, I promise that, with your love, we're going to get through this together," she said through tears. Berns says the heightened attention happens in part because other people's pain is uncomfortable, even taboo. We want a clean, clear statement about the loss and reaction from the surviving half of a well-known couple to sew up the narrative. Instead of trying to hurry the grieving process up or tiptoe around it, the public should allow people to grieve and speak in their own time. There are practical matters, too. Some unmarried partners leave clear instructions on how to include loved ones in family decisions after their passing, such as a last will, while some do not. The latter can leave a boyfriend or girlfriend adrift. Berns notes it is helpful for a grieving partner when the family allows him or her in on decisions such as funeral planning. She advises those who have lost a partner to make clear early on they want to be included in honoring their loved one. Fox says she had a good relationship with Doheny's parents and was able to help with his memorial. The couple had bonded over their love of reading, and Doheny left behind an unpublished novel. So Fox helped establish the Christopher Doheny Award at the New York Mercantile Library's Center for Fiction, which is granted to a writer who has dealt with a life-threatening illness firsthand or via a close relative or friend. Sometimes it helps to hold onto a tangible piece of a relationship. In September 2011,  Allen "Skip" Haughay Jr. and his horse Regal Bull were fatally struck by a pickup on the way to a party a half-mile away from his farm -- leaving behind his partner of almost three years, Abel Urbina. The two weren't married. They wanted to wait for Proposition 8, a voter-approved ballot measure that made same-sex marriage illegal in California, to be overturned. Haughay did not have a will, so his assets went to his mother, who did not want to keep the ranch that her son had filled with horses, pigs and donkeys. A few months before his death, Haughay was diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancer and said he wanted Urbina to take care of the animals should he die. Urbina ended up selling his place in downtown San Jose, California, and buying Haughay's three-acre property in nearby Morgan Hill -- along with all the animals -- to honor that wish. "And they're still there, they're still happy," Urbina says. Berns, the sociologist, says if you can embrace or reclaim a ritual or special place, such as the farm, it's a way of feeling connected that's more active than just sitting alone, being sad. For Fox, that meant carrying a tiny portion of Doheny's ashes along the Camino de Santiago, a 500-mile hike through Spain and France. As his health deteriorated, Doheny asked her to take his ashes along on the trek after he passed away because he regretted not being able to travel with her more. Berns says that moving forward -- whether entering a new relationship or just going out and having fun again -- is honoring the deceased loved one. Urbina says since he and Haughay weren't married, people had more gumption to ask when he would date again. "You have to move on when you're ready to move on," he says. "I need to move on because, knowing Skip, he would not have wanted me to curl up in a ball and cry for a whole year and be miserable." Fox says she and Doheny only broached the subject once. "It was really hard for Chris," she says. "He obviously wanted me to be happy, but he really wanted it to be with him." Have you dealt with the loss of a partner?

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/15/living/flats-love-flat-shoes-style/index.html	living	Flats, a love letter to shoes - CNN.com	2014/05/15	Thursday May 15 08:23:17 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Kelci Stringer realized her days in high heels were numbered when her children began to walk. She struggled to keep up with them in her strappy stilettos and platform pumps, and the situation only worsened as they got older and needed to be shuttled around from school to soccer and myriad extracurricular activities. The Atlanta mother still loves heels for special occasions, but her daily routine calls for flats. Slippers, loafers and sneakers are part of her uniform but she struggled to find unique varieties at a decent price. When she decided to start her own business, the name "flats" sprang to mind while she was getting a pedicure. "I saw a void in the market that needed to be filled," Stringer said. "My father said to me, 'You've bought enough shoes so you ought to know something about them.'" Sure, heels will always be a mainstay of women's fashion. But flats are getting their due on the streets and the runway with more embellishment and detail, belying the common perception of a basic ballet flat.  Stringer's Buckhead boutique, "FLATZ" is full of variations: embroidered ikat loafers, faux pink snakeskin slippers, bright yellow jelly sandals and leather studded flip-flops. Located in a small shopping plaza among a deli, hair salon and shoe repair shop, FLATZ opened in October to cater to shoppers who don't want to sacrifice style for comfort. Business is picking up with summer around the corner as shoppers look for comfortable beach sandals or stylish walking shoes for sightseeing vacations. Some might say flats lack the appeal of a sky-high stiletto, but strutting around in comfort can be sexy, too. "I feel like wearing a pair of flats connotes a sense of low maintenance that men are typically drawn toward," said Leandra Medine, founder of the popular "Man Repeller" fashion blog that celebrates trends women love and men hate. "Of course, the purported argument against them and pro-heels is related to the sex factor. They're obviously the more conventionally 'attractive' choice." The return of a classic Flats are having a moment as mainstream fashion embraces menswear-inspired looks for women, with wing-tipped oxfords, embroidered loafers and smoking slippers gracing fall 2014 runway shows. Glamour Magazine recently started featuring flats in a #FlatsFriday Instagram post which also invites Instagrammers to share their favorite flats. On the popular style blog "View From The Topp" Kate Brien chronicles her daily outfits, paying tribute to a wide range of flats, from her beloved Birkenstocks and Clio sandals to tasseled loafers and colorful oxfords. Heels occasionally make an appearance, but "I'm rarely in heels during my day-to-day," she said. "I'll wear heels on occasion but flats are much more me," said Brien, who describes her look as "Parisian Tomboy/Messy Vogue." "I like shoes that are comfortable and classic. Of course interesting details and fun colors are always great, but my favorite pairs are ones that I know I will have forever." The basic ballet flat has been around for centuries, modeled after the dancer's ballet slipper as an alternative to the unwieldy heels and chopines of the Renaissance era. Their popularity waxed and waned over the years before French shoemaker Rose Repetto revived production of ballet slippers in the 20th century. French actor Brigitte Bardot is credited with bringing the classic "cendrillon" shoe to the masses after Repetto created it at her request for her to wear it in "...And God Created Women." Actor Audrey Hepburn is also thought to have contributed to the popularity of ballet flats after wearing them in "Funny Face." Women have been complaining about heels for as long as they've been wearing them. "We'll know that feminism has worked when a woman goes up to get a best actress Oscar wearing flat, comfortable shoes," author Caitlin Moran snarkily noted in her 2012 book, "How to be a Woman." "How much more fun we would be having if we could only stop being slaves to the torture stilts we insisted on wearing. We could then stand around and chat and laugh all night like the men ... and maybe even do a little bit of business." Opting for flats over heels might require a mental shift in women who've come to identify themselves by their footwear. 'Reprogramming' perceptions The typical customer at Atlanta's FLATZ boutique is in her mid-30s, someone who "knows what works for her and knows what she wants," owner Kelcie Stringer said. "She's not competing with anyone, or what's on TV," Stringer said. "I appreciate a customer who knows what she wants instead of my having to convince her of what she needs." Other shoppers tend to come in because they can no longer wear heels due to foot problems, or because they're unhappy with their body and want their shoes to be their statement piece, store manager Christina Mitchell said. Often, her job requires "reprogramming" their minds to make them understand that flats can be chic, she said. "Sometimes, when people think of flats, they say flats are boring," she said. "But they can have a lot of personality." When shopper Tanya Lewis visited the store this week, she was already a convert. Flats are her go-to footwear for work and socializing. Her mother, on the other hand, had just recently come around to them after leaving her job in banking. "When I was working I wore heels every day. I think you need them in corporate America," Lewis' mother said, declining to give her name. The pair left with a pair of gladiator sandals for Lewis, and loafers and pointed-toe slippers for her mother. "I'm veering more toward flats with age," she said.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/29/living/women-hair-loss-alopecia-relate/index.html	living	Women with hair loss face emotional battles - CNN.com	2014/04/29	Tuesday Apr 29 07:39:12 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Prom night sends most teen girls on a dizzying quest for the perfect dress, accessories and hairstyle to make their ensemble complete. On her prom night, Jennifer DeFreece was harried by one simple detail: "I just wanted eyebrows for my prom pictures." When she was just a baby, DeFreece was diagnosed with alopecia totalis, an autoimmune disease that results in the total loss of scalp hair. By her 1st birthday, she'd lost all of her hair. "I was like Charlie Brown," says DeFreece, now 33 and living in Northridge, California. Alopecia is nondiscriminatory. It can occur in men and women at any age and is a strictly physical disease, but sufferers say it's also a disease of the spirit, exacting a devastating emotional toll in this world of silky shampoo commercials and Rapunzel fairy tales. For those who experience it, particularly women who often self-identify with the color and style of their locks, it's about learning to manage the disease and not be defined by it. They choose a way to self-present: wig, no wig, clean shaven or a little of each. DeFreece ventured into wearing wigs in kindergarten as the childish innocence of her peers grew more inquisitive and uncensored. She continued to do so throughout junior high. At the time, the wigs available were "very obvious," she says. Before then, being bald never seemed taboo; it was her normal. Then came sleepover age: A girl insisted DeFreece put a housecoat over the pillow where she would rest her head. To that girl, baldness was gross. In those years, DeFreece says she became more shy and hyperaware about what made her different. "I hated it. I would wish that my hair would grow back," DeFreece says. In high school, when she realized people might make fun of her anyway, she took one a giant leap toward self-awareness: She decided to ditch the hairpiece and embrace the beauty of bald. Brave middle schooler tells peers she's bald "I thought, 'Let them make fun of somebody with a medical condition, let's see what happens,' " she says. The response was mature: People backed off and even stood up for her. Learning to value yourself and not your hair According to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, a big part of the coping process is about "learning to value yourself for who you are, not for how much hair you have or don't have." Sue McHale is a psychology lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University in England, and has extensively researched the psychological toll of the disease, including co-authoring the book, "Coping with Alopecia." "Baldness, for whatever reason, is associated firstly with aging and secondly with illness," McHale said in an e-mail. "So society is automatically shocked or fearful of this." McHale's co-researcher and husband, Nigel Hunt, has alopecia universalis, the rarest form of the disease, one that results in total loss of body hair. (The most common form of alopecia is alopecia areata, which causes the hair to fall out in patches.) When McHale found there was hardly any psychological research done on the disease, they dug in. "It opened up a floodgate of responses and many said that they felt no one had been listening to them for years," she says. It was no longer just a physical diagnosis. She says their research found that there was a perception from both sexes that it was worse for women; that it seemed more acceptable for men to appear bald. However, both men and women with alopecia aren't opting to go bald -- "it is forced upon them, so in that way, they respond to it very much in the same way," she says. Those who are balding or are born with a hairless pate can experience embarrassment, hopelessness, hastiness for a "quick fix," and, if a wig wearer, the fear that others might find out that their hair actually isn't their own. She found a man who didn't care about hair For Lauren Crawford, 29, that feeling came to a head on a first date in high school. After a few previous dates didn't handle her diagnosis so well, she decided to lay it all out on the table that very first night, warning him that she had something to confess. "'If you want to walk out the door, that's OK,'" she remembers saying. "Oh thank God," her date responded. "That's it?!" Crawford, of Macomb, Michigan, has been married to the man to whom she made that first-date confession for five years. Crawford, like DeFreece, received a diagnosis early on in life -- at 3 -- but didn't see more serious aspects of the disease, especially psychologically, until her senior year in high school. "I didn't think anything of it," she says. Seeing a bald woman wasn't out of her realm of experience; her grandmother was going through chemotherapy at the same time. As her hairline changed rapidly in her teen years, she sought solace in scrunchies and scarves. When those no longer did the job, she and her mom went wig shopping. Her friends at the time started to call her "Baldy" and tugged at her hair. She admits feeling like she would never get married and never have kids. Now, she has both -- and an unforeseen career as a hairdresser. "I always had a creative eye for hair; I was always creative in hiding my bald spots," says Crawford, who wears a wig every day, calling it "an accessory." For other women, Crawford has become an unlikely ally. She recounts how a woman came in heartbroken as the effects of chemotherapy laid her scalp bare. Crawford took her wig off and showed her true self; they wept together and talked through the change. "It's just hair," she remembers saying. 'For me to walk out bald, it's so hard' Vanessa McWilliams, 30, of Calgary is in a more transitional period -- often forgoing the wigs that were her safety blankets for more than 20 years. "I love who I am, but at the same time, for me to walk out bald, it's so hard because there's so much trauma growing up," she says, recalling jabs such as "baldy" throughout her teenage years. With the new hairless territory, she says she had to adapt to the occasional awkward moment of a stranger approaching her because they think she's sick. "You're healthy! There's nothing wrong with you, but society still has to look at you. It's so hard to hear there's nothing wrong with you. The mentality of it is still a mental battle. It's really tricky," she says. Unlike DeFreece and Crawford, who were too young at the time of their diagnosis to comprehend the condition, McWilliams didn't receive her diagnosis until adolescence. "From the date that I found my first bald spot (at age 9) until I was 17, I had a really big hatred for the word 'alopecia' and everything that it put me through," she says. McWilliams now operates Confident Curls, a mobile wig boutique specifically geared toward women who are coping with hair loss. Her epiphany: She's lived with this every single day and knows first-hand what people in the same situation need. "I wish at 9 years old I had known that it was OK. It's so simple. ... Everyone is dealt something they have to struggle with," McWilliams says. "Now, I know it isn't the worst thing that could happen to me." But there's always work to do. DeFreece calls those less-than-pretty-feeling days, as all people have, "an alopecia day." There are also upsides: "People will always remember you, and you can use that as an advantage," she says. She has met a network of women through organizations such as the National Alopecia Areata Foundation (DeFreece attends its annual conference every year) and social media, which has helped her adjust. When they get together, their lack of hair isn't the glaring beacon it is to others. "I'm not just Jennifer the bald girl. I'm Jennifer the marketing major. I'm Jennifer from California," DeFreece says.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/23/living/born-free-end-mother-child-hiv/index.html	living	Designers unite to end HIV transmission - CNN.com	2014/04/23	Wednesday Apr 23 03:26:19 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Every day in sub-Saharan Africa 700 children are infected with HIV, mostly through their mothers, according to the United Nations. Fortunately, with the right treatment most cases of mother-child HIV transmission are entirely preventable, a goal the international AIDS community is working to make a reality by 2015. To that end, the New York-based charity Born Free is teaming up with top names in the fashion and beauty industries to raise money to stop mother-child transmission of HIV once and for all. Born Free has recruited Vogue editor Anna Wintour along with 22 designers and models to each create unique wearable pieces from an exclusive print by African artist Wangechi Mutu. Proceeds from sales of the clothing will go toward getting lifesaving drugs to those who need them. Stella McCartney, Donna Karan, Tory Burch and Gisele Bundchen are just a few of the celeb mothers and designers who are participating. Shopbop, owned by Amazon, is exclusively selling the line, which launches Wednesday. Pieces cost $250 or less. "Born Free is an idea that came from a place of deep respect for the delicate cycle of life. How incredible to be able to work with gifted designers, who as mothers recognize what the devastating loss of a child could mean and how easily that loss can be avoided," said Mutu. Designers were given free rein to create with Mutu's prints. Each designer presented something for mother and child. Isabel Marant, known for her bohemian vibe, went with a micro-print on a peasant blouse. Jenna Lyons from J.Crew went with louche pants and a pleated girl's skirt. The effort is the brainchild of John Megrue, chairman of private equity firm Apax Partners, who was concerned with the spread of HIV to the smallest and most vulnerable people in sub-Saharan Africa. There are a number of private, public and international organizations on the ground in sub-Saharan Africa, fighting the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Megrue's vision was to see private sector charities like MAC AIDS and mothers2mothers join forces with organizations like UNAIDS and PEPFAR. Born Free was announced in November 2013 as an umbrella organization to raise money and distribute medicine where it's needed. With just one pill a day -- a combination of several anti-retroviral medicines -- a mother with HIV or AIDS can almost completely eradicate the risk of passing the disease on to her baby, according to Born Free. "I am thrilled that the fashion community has so generously added their time, talent and voice to our collective efforts to meet the serious, but achievable challenge of eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV by December 31, 2015," said Megrue. Born Free will raise money via sales of the clothing from Shopbop, donations, and Conde Nast magazine subscription fees in May and June. One hundred percent of proceeds will be donated to Born Free, and the MAC AIDS Fund will match up to $500,000 of all donations. The organization's aim is to work with governments within countries where the rate of mother-child HIV transmission is high to move toward solving the issue. "We've seen incredible advances in HIV treatment, but to end the epidemic, we need to ensure all at-risk pregnant women are tested for HIV, and if they are positive, they receive HIV treatment so their babies can be born HIV free," said Nancy Mahon, global executive director, MAC AIDS Fund.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/20/living/stronger-marriage-with-affairs-redbook-relate/index.html	living	How affairs make my marriage stronger - CNN.com	2014/05/20	Tuesday May 20 09:57:40 EDT 2014	(RedbookMag.com) -- It's a Wednesday night, and my boyfriend and I are drinking wine and making out in the back booth of a dimly lit bar. It feels like nothing else in the world exists... until my phone vibrates. "It's my husband. The kids are in bed," I say, then put my phone in my purse and pull my boyfriend toward me. I spend half a second staring at the diamond on my engagement ring before hiding my hand from my sight line. It's not a secret that I'm married, but it's also not something I want to think about right now. Am I a horrible person? Without context, I know I sound horrible. But in my marriage, having affairs works. My husband and I don't talk about it. But I'm certain our don't-ask-don't-tell rule is what has allowed our marriage to last as long as it has. Redbook: The Biggest Complaints from Unhappy Husbands Notice that I didn't say we're in an open marriage -- we're not. An open marriage is transparent, with agreed-upon rules and an understanding of what both parties will and will not do with others. My marriage is opaque. I recognize what Frank and Claire Underwood have in "House of Cards," although I like to think my husband and I aren't as soulless as their characters. But there are similarities: We know the other has secrets, but we don't care to find out more. It's an attitude people think of as very French -- the idea that you can have an affair and a healthy marriage. Quite honestly, it works. But that doesn't mean it's easy. When Dave* and I met in our late 20s, I knew that he was a player. So was I. We also had chemistry beyond anything else I'd ever experienced. We just got each other. When I was with him, I could be myself. He was the only boyfriend I've ever told the truth to about how many men I'd slept with, because I believed that no matter what I said, he'd never judge me. He also never seemed to get jealous. Redbook: 10 Lies Men Want Their Wives to Tell Them After about six months of late-night booty calls, Dave and I settled into a proper relationship and started calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend. At first, it was incredibly volatile. After not hearing from him for an evening, I'd go ballistic. He'd refuse to engage, saying he had nothing to apologize for. We yelled about cheating -- he'd do it, I'd do it, we'd be furious with each other. But eventually, I realized this dynamic wouldn't change. One of us would always act out if cheating was against the rules. But what if it wasn't? What if we both admitted that, yes, we were sometimes tempted, and that sometimes we acted on that temptation? I think I was the one who brought it up over dinner one night, just after we'd moved in together. I told him that I'd no longer ask questions, that I didn't want to know. He said he'd do the same. We reaffirmed that we loved each other, and that wouldn't change. And then, without drawing up any official rules, we embarked on our anything-but-traditional relationship. Redbook: 10 Things He'll Never Forget You Said We got married seven years ago and now have two sons, ages 4 and nearly 2. The arguments started up again during my first pregnancy. I was pretty sure Dave was sleeping with someone else while I was stuck at home. Before, I felt we could both have our cake and eat it, too, but the last thing I wanted to do when I was pregnant was seek out an affair. It seemed tawdry and gross, and I resented the fact that all my husband had to do was slip off his ring and he'd look single. Meanwhile, I was huge, hormonal, and knew my husband was cheating on me. When I told him how I felt, he broke off his side situation. Toward the last trimester of my pregnancy, Dave was amazing. He was home every night, did everything around the house, and was 100% there for me -- but I still felt resentful and like I'd gotten the short end of the stick. A few months after our son was born, I quickly got into a relationship with a former co-worker. It wasn't great -- I really would have rather been at home with my son, and I felt I was punishing myself for my husband's behavior during my pregnancy. I liked my co-worker, but I know I pushed us into romantic territory fast because I wanted to feel desired. My husband and I had some huge fights during that time, and we both uttered the word "divorce." But deep down, neither of us wanted that. We love each other. We also seriously like other people. I ended my affair, and for the next six months or so, my husband and I recommitted to our marriage and our family. And once we settled into a comfortable rhythm of life with a baby, we both began relaxing into our old routines. He came home late. I flirted with men when I went out with my single girlfriends. And little by little, we reached the point we're at now, where both of us occasionally have affairs on the side but always come home to each other. Redbook: Things Men Love to Hear in Bed Normally, the guys I have affairs with are men I meet through my job -- I travel a lot -- as an event coordinator, at parties, through friends of friends, or even old flames I've reconnected with on Facebook. I've always been the type of person who gets physical fast, and being married hasn't changed that. I don't keep my marriage a secret from the guys I date -- I don't take off my rings and I mention my husband and kids in front of them -- but I also don't make it an issue. Often, they're cheating as well, and I feel there's an unspoken code about what we do and don't discuss. Right now, I'm 40 and my husband is 38, and I do wonder how long we can keep this up. I don't want to actively seek out affairs. I feel like my work, thanks to all those business trips, has made it easy to fall into them without doing much damage to my everyday life. I haven't said "I love you" to anyone else since I met my husband, and I do sometimes wonder how my husband feels toward the women he meets. I know -- and hope he knows -- that very few women would put up with a similar type of relationship, and I think that understanding is part of the bedrock of our bond. Elle.com: The Number One Reason Men Cheat When I say I'm going out, he tells me to have a good time. He'll send texts, but I'm not obligated to respond. I text him if I won't be coming home (which, truthfully, happens very rarely since we've had kids), and I always have safe sex. Sometimes, I truly am just going out for a glass of wine with a girlfriend, but I like the intrigue that I could be meeting a man. I'm pretty sure when he goes out, it's to meet a woman -- or women. I think I can tell when he is in a serious "relationship" -- he'll wear the same cologne and leave with a book tucked under his arm to give her -- versus when he may be casually meeting someone for sex. He also travels a lot for work, and I don't know what he does while he's gone. It's harder when I think something is going on while we're both in town. The more I think about it, the less okay I am with our lifestyle, so I've become pretty good at shutting down that part of my brain. Because truth be told, I do worry that Dave might fall in love with someone else. That's why when I see his secret smiles or notice him spending tons of time texting, I step it up on my end, asking him to be home on a certain night and initiating sex. I remind him how much I love him and how much our marriage means to me. I won't talk to him about it directly, though, because while it's terrifying to imagine my husband leaving me, I know it's possible. But that's true in any relationship, and I don't think the fact that my husband can sleep with other women makes him any more likely to fall in love with one of them. I believe that if you love something, you let it go, and if it's yours, it'll come back to you. Of course, that's easier said than done, but it's something I try to remind myself. And so far, he's come back every time. Elle.com: Why I Married a Sex Addict And for that matter, so have I. I've had three relationships since Dave and I got married. Even though I was very fond of each of those men, I didn't want to be married to them. The affairs aren't my real life. They're fancy cocktails and tiny plates and falling asleep without the whooshing sound of a baby monitor. And they make me that much happier for the family I do have. I've often thought about what would happen if Dave and I were to be more transparent, but I don't think it would work. We live in a society where monogamy is everything, and it's hard to explain that you can love having sex with multiple people but still only love one person. We both know this, but if we tried to put our behavior into words, I'm afraid we'd say things we'd regret. The closest we came was when I got an abnormal Pap smear result. The retest came back normal, but it did give me pause and make me wonder how safe what we were doing was, physically and emotionally. Dave and I had a serious talk about safety, but spoke mostly in the abstract -- about things that might have happened in the past -- and came down to the rule that we will always have safe sex with other people. I'm not sure what will happen as our sons get older -- or, for that matter, what will happen as we get older. For now, our personal decisions don't affect our sons' lives, but if that changes -- if the kids start asking questions, or if one of us starts missing major milestones because we're spending too much time out of the house -- then Dave and I may need to lay everything on the table and reconfigure the dynamics of our relationship. We also may find that playing with fire isn't as much fun. Already, I find my priorities have shifted so much in the past decade -- most of the time, there's nowhere else I'd rather be than home on the floor, playing with my son and husband. But that's most of the time. Once every few weeks, there's something magical about being out with a man who's not my husband. Just call it the secret spark that keeps my marriage alive. *Name has been changed.  Reprinted with permission of Hearst Communications, Inc. 
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/20/living/stormy-horse-birth-irpt/index.html	living	Thousands lose sleep over horse's birth - CNN.com	2014/05/20	Tuesday May 20 10:25:46 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- When it comes to animals, it seems people like to watch just about anything give birth. That includes an Airville, Pennsylvania, horse named Stormy. It's been over two weeks since Stormy's owner, Jodie Otte, flipped on a streaming webcam inside the horse's stable so she and her 14-year-old daughter wouldn't miss the birth. But soon there were thousands of eyes watching Stormy's every move over the Internet, waiting for her foal to arrive. The cream and white mare, who gave birth to a filly early Tuesday -- days past her due date -- has drawn the attention of horse enthusiasts, parents and children around the world. Stormy's live webcam feed is hosted on Mare Stare, a site devoted to hosting webcam videos that feature horses giving birth and show foals standing, eating and playing for the very first time. Otte says the first day the 18-year-old horse's webcam went live, it got more than 10,000 hits on Mare Stare. A friend of Otte's posted a screenshot from the webcam on CNN iReport, where it in turn got 18,000 views. Man leaves $1,000 tip for dog's surgery Otte, an accountant and photographer who lives in nearby Norrisville, Maryland, said she and her close friends all understand the humor and slight absurdity in Stormy's unexpected popularity. "It's nuts. If my feed goes down people call me at work," she said. "I have no idea why people are so into Stormy, but I think it's the miracle of birth," Otte said. Sandra Armenteros, a close friend and photography colleague of Otte's who shared the story on iReport, has been closely tracking the horse's rise to stardom. "The first international fans came from Canada and Australia, where we have colleagues. After that, it really took off. The world is literally watching this horse." One family that eagerly awaited Stormy's delivery was the Bielawski family in Goshen, New York. Jamie Bielawski, another friend of Otte's, home-schools her four daughters, ages 7 to 11. She started showing her girls Stormy's webcam feed after Otte opened the webcam up to the public. Photos: Animals in the snow "I wanted the girls to experience a horse be born," she said Tuesday. "A lot of kids today go to Walmart and see a chicken come from a package and that it comes from Perdue, but I want my kids to understand the environment and animals and what animals go through." She has made the webcam a learning experience for her girls, teaching them about horse anatomy and the science behind pregnancy. "When they wake up they don't say, 'Has the foal been born yet?' They ask, 'Is the sac showing yet? Are the hooves showing?' They know the process of a horse's birth," she said. Her 9-year-old daughter, Andie, loves watching Stormy with her sisters on their smartphone, and they'll pass it around to see how the mare is doing. "It is cool watching an animal give birth," Andie said. "I am excited to see what the baby will look like. I hope it happens soon." Stormy's foal took its time to leave the womb, which made some viewers impatient. "I stayed up till 4 a.m. watching last night! So tired right now! The royal baby wasn't this anticipated," Gemma Reeve of London wrote on Otte's Facebook page, which has pictures of Stormy with her foal, a filly. Cooling off in the dog days of summer Another commenter said the webcam feed was becoming an endless loop. "This is like the movie 'Groundhog Day.' We might all start to lose it like Bill Murray soon," Kelly Barclay wrote. Some people blamed the worldwide exposure for Stormy's delay in delivery. On Mare Stare's Facebook page, one commenter wrote, "Poor mare is holding back on foaling because there are way too many people hanging out around her." This isn't the first time an animal's health has gripped the attention of thousands of Internet fans. Scores of people were outraged when the National Zoo's panda cam was turned off during the 2013 U.S. government shutdown. And Reddit's community clung anxiously to updates from a Navy hospital corpsman who saved four orphaned rabbits and nursed them back to health. The nests of various birds of prey have drawn avid audiences to watch eggs hatch and chicks grow up. Stormy's baby, Pixie, was born early Tuesday to much fanfare. "So glad I have this iPad mini, I keep checking during the night," Wendy Puthuff anxiously wrote on Facebook on Monday evening. Sadly, after all the watching and waiting, Puthuff missed the big moment. "Fell asleep with my iPad after midnight, woke up just now and I missed it," Puthuff posted around 6:30 a.m. Tuesday. "Anyone record it?" CNN's Henry Hanks and Daphne Sashin contributed to this story.

This piece is part of an Asian American Heritage Month series that explores evolving Asian-American identity.  (CNN) -- I'm Kristina Wong, and I'm what many Americans would refer to as "one of those idiots on reality TV." Recently, I was featured on a new documentary series that focuses on the lives of Asian Americans: "I'm Asian American and... ." I thought the show would be a rare platform to show an Asian American story that had not been told: my life as a performance artist and hip-hop mogul. As an artist, the issues I explore have been deemed too "scary," "niche" and "unprofitable" for mainstream media. Among these issues: The high rates of depression and suicide in the Asian American community, white privilege, racial stereotypes, poverty tourism, gender and sexism. What drew me to becoming a performance artist was the chance to create my message on my terms.  I don't wait for someone to write me a role. I certainly don't wait for someone to cast me in a role. And I'm not holding my breath waiting for a bad-ass wisecracking Chinese American lady character like me to show up on "Game of Thrones." Leading Asian American women exist on television, but I can count them on one hand. When you see other Asian women my age on scripted television, they are usually side characters handing over scalpels, playing someone's badly accented mother or are scantily clad. If I'm taking on issues barely addressed among Asian Americans, why would I expect mainstream media to pick up on them, too? Some back story: I grew up in San Francisco. I'm Chinese American, got great grades all through high school and went to UCLA. But I bucked stable career paths in medicine, law and engineering to pursue the most unstable of careers: performance art. My performances don't fit the standard fare of what most people might expect of an Asian American woman. I don't tell reductive jokes about my American-born mother's nonexistent Chinese accent. I don't do martial arts (though I so own several zumba DVDs). I don't tell stories peppered with exotic details of Chinese culture that deliver Confuciusesque wisdom. My work has already killed any possibility of a future in politics: Stand-up comedy dressed as a giant vagina, crashing the Miss Chinatown Pageant dressed as a fake Miss Chinatown and marrying myself (twice!) in public ceremonies. Last year, I recorded a hit rap album in northern Uganda with local rappers. I've also toured five original one-woman theater shows around the world. I'd like to think my approach is bawdy, funny and fearless. I've been told I'm the living antithesis of a stereotypical submissive and quiet Asian woman. So I decided to tackle that taboo on my episode of "I'm Asian American and ..." by collecting reparations from "yellow fever guys" -- slang for white men who only date Asian women. My dates, all real, described how they prefer dating Asian women because we are "hairless," "gentle" and "love to cook and clean": basically every objectifying stereotype of a submissive Asian woman. During our dates, I coerce these men to clean my house, pay my exorbitant dinner tabs, and watch me perform a very painfully long performance art piece complete with multiple screaming birthing scenes. It's not about gold digging, it's about finding small moments of justice for a lifetime of being objectified and fetishized as an Asian woman. No, I don't expect to win an award for showing these white men that an Asian woman can be as crude and wisecracking as people of any other race. And I don't expect people to jump up and declare that I've ended racial oppression with a reality television appearance. But my 15 minutes of fame (23 to be exact) felt like a rare moment to provide some cathartic humor for those wanting to see an Asian American woman who would go to the outrageous depths that characters on scripted television show would not. I look forward to a day when I see a sitcom telling the stories of every different Asian ethnicity, LGBT, women, mixed race Asian Americans and the Asian Americans like me whose families have been here for generations. From the trailer, it seems like ABC's new sitcom "Fresh Off the Boat" will be a funny subversive take on the Chinese American family experience. It's the first scripted sitcom in 20 years to feature an Asian American family on network television. The last, Margaret Cho's "All-American Girl," was panned by critics. The show's failure didn't stop Margaret from making comedy. If anything, it strengthened her, and she told the story of that show's failure in subsequent media and appearances. But I hope that viewers don't expect one sitcom to tell every Asian American's story, any more than a sitcom with a white family does not tell the story of every white person in this country. "Asian American" includes a diverse range people of Asian descent, each with a unique history and culture. Opinion: The surprising racial bias against Asians The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kristina Wong.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/19/living/kid-entrepreneurs-irpt-schools/index.html	living	You're never too young to be CEO - CNN.com	2014/05/19	Monday May 19 08:29:42 EDT 2014	 (CNN) -- Lily Warren was just 8 years old when she decided to start her own business with her younger sisters. The girls had already visited a marketplace for young business owners and opened their own bank accounts at the Young Americans Bank in Denver, which touts itself as the world's only bank designed for kids. "There were tons of young entrepreneurs selling what they made. It was a really cool place," said Lily, now 13. When their parents started beekeeping at their home in Littleton, Colorado, the girls found the inspiration they really needed. While they weren't able to harvest enough honey to sell, the sisters noticed that their parents always collected a significant amount of beeswax. Instead of throwing it away, they thought they could find a way to use it. The girls researched what could be made at home with beeswax. By 2009, Lily, Chloe and Sophie were in business as the Sweet Bee Sisters, making lip balm in flavors like strawberry and root beer, and lotion bars in lavender and bamboo. They sell their products at local stores and, for the last three years, at their own stall at the entrepreneurs' marketplace that inspired them. In 2013, the Warren sisters were named finalists in a young entrepreneurs competition and were awarded $250 and mentoring from a business leader. "Their ability to speak confidently with customers, to make decisions collectively, to work hard for something they want and to designate and fulfill responsibilities has [all] been enhanced through their business experience," said Lisa Warren, the Sweet Bee Sisters' mom. Around the country, children -- some of them barely old enough to read -- are turning their big, creative ideas into money-making businesses. And their parents, schools and business leaders are cheering them on. 'It's never too early' Business consultants and serial entrepreneurs say that it's never too early to teach kids the benefits of sound money management and smart business practices. Some business leaders around the country started businesses as kids, including Honest Tea's CEO Seth Goldman, who sold golf balls he dug up from the course near his home, while Vosges Haut-Chocolat's CEO Katrina Markoff, who has said she offered Easy-Bake Oven treats to customers. "Entrepreneurship comes with the emotional ups and downs," said Adam Toren, who co-authored the "Kidpreneurs" books with his brother, Matthew. "Learning how to overcome obstacles at a young age definitely played a huge role in becoming who we are today." Today, the Toren brothers are serial entrepreneurs who founded Youngentrepreneur.com. Toren said they like to pay it forward by providing businesses with tips and ideas they've picked up over the years. "Sharpening a child's entrepreneurial skills will equip them with the skills necessary to tackle a limitless future," Toren said. That doesn't mean all young entrepreneurs focus their time on business instead of school. Learning entrepreneurial skills can also put young people on the path to more learning. A study of students involved in the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship, a program that teaches business skills to low-income youth, showed just that. Students involved in the program had a 32% increase in interest in attending college, while students who did not participate saw a 17% decrease, according to a Harvard Graduate School of Education study from 2002 to 2004. The study also found an increase in leadership behaviors among students who participated. Christine Poorman, executive director of the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship in Chicago, believes the numbers would be higher today -- a recent alumni survey of 300 students found that 90% were in college. She often sees students who completed the program using money made from their businesses to pay for college. While young entrepreneurship can lead to college and careers, some young people see it as a way to find their owns voices. Nine-year-old Leila Kaufman of New York City didn't like that adults were reviewing technology toys for kids. With the help of her dad, Michael, she created a website called RethinkToys. Together, they produce videos of Leila reviewing the latest tech toys for kids. The project launched a business and helped her create a place to voice her opinion. "If it's a kid's toy, shouldn't kids be rating it?" Leila asked. Michael helps Leila make contacts with companies and attend product launches she wouldn't normally be able to access. She's been to media events for video games and sat in on closed-door meetings with a company that created a popular game she reviewed, Kaufman said. Plans to expand and monetize RethinkToys are in the future, but for now, Leila's parents are happy that she's learning to give her opinion honestly, confidently and articulately. "At all these events, she was the only kid there and just blew everyone in the media away," he said. Kid entrepreneurs also have powerful lessons to learn about balance. Leila's mom, Tammy Kaufman, said they have to remind their daughter that she's a kid, and she has other priorities beyond her website. "I think it's difficult for her to be an entrepreneur at this age," Tammy Kaufman said. "There are a lot of things her parents and her teachers make her do." 'I teach my kids to fail spectacularly' Canada-based business mentor Cameron Herold, who started his first company at 21, says parents and teachers could do a better job of nurturing "entrepreneurial traits" in children. His father raised him to be an entrepreneur when he saw that Herold wasn't likely to be a model student or employee. Herold had little interest in school, where he struggled to pay attention and believed the school system was trying to mold him into something he wasn't. Herold says more schools are trying to build students' confidence in areas that match their interests and abilities, rather than focusing entirely on improving areas where they struggle. "Let your weaknesses be your weaknesses," he said. "Let's teach kids according to their abilities." After all, not every child-led business is a precocious success. Michigan high school English teacher Nicholas Provenzano launched "20 Time" in his classroom this fall -- a program that gives students an opportunity to explore topics that interest them -- and asked his students to keep blogs that document their progress. The students received only one hour of class time per week for the projects, but most invested time outside the classroom, Provenzano said. Provenzano said the project helps students to lead their own learning and understand how to recover from failure -- one of the core lessons of entrepreneurship. His students' projects ranged from training to run a marathon to knitting hats for newborns to developing a mobile game app to designing and selling clothes. The main thing Provenzano wanted his students to get from this project "is that failure is a part of life." In the real world, he wants his students to be able to take risks, he said. "I teach my kids to fail spectacularly and grow from that experience," he said. "To be effective problem solvers and critical thinkers, failure has to be an accepted part of the process and not something that should stop people from trying." Emily Fleming, one of Provenzano's students, set out to design a clothing line and set up an Etsy shop to sell it. When she struggled to complete her project, she wrote about the realization that fear of failure and the potential embarrassment often keeps her from pursuing new ideas. "I had this amazing opportunity to create and explore and I didn't take full advantage because of an irrational fear of failure and embarrassment," she wrote on her project blog. "I want to be able to go out for my presentation and say that I conquered this irrational fear, and created something without a worry that someone wouldn't like it as much as I do. 'Twenty time' is changing for me and I am ready and excited to take this as far as I can." 'She can be the creator of her destiny' In success or in failure, entrepreneurship can be a powerful early lesson in money management. Rich Martinez, CEO of the Young Americans Center in Denver, says that kids not only need to be motivated to be entrepreneurs, but they also need an environment that will foster the kind of risk-taking that's required. "Kids are motivated by money, but adults don't give them a chance to make it. We just give it to them," he said. That's not the best way for kids to learn how the rest of the world works, he said. "Somehow we've created a society that isn't OK with failure, that isn't OK with taking risks," he said. Seven-year-old Scout Kingsley and her mom, Ashley, started their Happy Wear girls' accessories line one night when they were making necklaces out of colorful paperclips. "Scout is definitely the artistic director, telling me what looks good and what will sell," Ashley Kingsley said. "I've never crafted before in my life. I had no way to really help her." Since Happy Wear launched in November, the company has profited more than $1,500 in Etsy sales and marketplace events, Kingsley says. Scout has also participated in the Denver young entrepreneurs marketplace. "I know Scout loves to make money and we opened a bank account for her. She loves watching her bank account grow," she said. They have plans for more markets and would love to see some of the pieces get picked up on a national scale. Scout said her love of dressing up and accessories makes running Happy Wear feel fun. Apart from production, Scout has learned a lot about marketing and packaging, she said. "I get better every time people order something," Scout said. Ashley Kingsley considers Happy Wear to be a learning experience for Scout; it teachers her that there's more than one way to acquire knowledge. "She's a kid, but she is, I believe, heads and shoulders above the kids her age," Ashley Kingsley said. "I hope this opens up her mind so she knows she can be the creator of her destiny."

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/15/living/dealing-with-inlaws-matrimony/index.html	living	In-laws at the wedding and beyond - CNN.com	2014/05/15	Thursday May 15 04:29:43 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Love them or hate them: In-laws are yours forever. And there's nothing like a wedding to make you get to know the newest addition to your family. Your wedding is likely the first time you've had to navigate tricky issues with your fianc's parents. The big event forces tough conversations about money, family, religion and taste -- and bring to light just how different or similar you and your in-laws may be. That said, a wedding is way more stressful than most any other interactions you'll ever have with your extended family. You're probably just getting your footing with one another, sorting out sore spots and tension points. So your future family forecast is looking bright if you can survive the wedding process together. In the meantime, consider this your designer guide to navigating the in-law relationship. Brides: The Most Flattering Wedding Dress for Your Body Type The Overbearing In-Laws Your future mother-in-law might have some very set ideas about your guest list, center pieces, religion in your ceremony, or maybe, all of these things. Plus, your own parents are probably weighing in on these very topics. Put simply: There are way too many cooks in the kitchen. While you're comfortable telling your fianc and your own parents what you really think, it's a lot harder to level with a mother who isn't your own. The good news: Her involvement means she cares, and wants the day to be just as meaningful as you do. So don't lose sight of her good intentions, but we get it, it's annoying! Brides: Kim Kardashian's Wedding Dress! 11 Fantasy Sketches If things reach a fever pitch -- say, she won't stop bugging you about not inviting her co-workers -- you need to call for reinforcements. Ask your fianc to talk to his parents. You and he can set boundaries for both sets of parents, and let your respective mothers and fathers know the "do not cross" lines. By explaining that this is a cross-parental policy, your mother-in-law will feel less slighted. And maybe, just maybe, her co-workers will be nixed from the list. Brides: The Most Creative Wedding Cakes of the Year The Laissez-Faire In-Laws Some of us have in-laws who just don't seem to care. They never ask about the wedding and seem borderline bored when you bring it up. There could be a variety of explanations: Maybe they view the event as something the bride's family should be involved in, and don't want to meddle. Or, they might have OD'd on past kids' weddings, so they're happy to sit this one out. The odds are that your in-laws are just trying to respect that this as your and your fianc's event. In the grand scheme of things, it's a lot better to have no meddling than the overbearing parents-in-law. Brides: Gorgeous Plus Size Wedding Dresses But to ensure that your in-laws feel included, you and your fianc are going to take the initiative. (After all, they probably want to help, but they also don't want to bother you.) Assign them an activity -- ask them to host a wedding weekend event or create a seating chart for their friends and family. Even just asking your mother-in-law for advice on your dress, or seeing if your father-in-law wants to join your dad and brother the morning of the wedding for golf can go a long way. This is your chance to bring your future in-laws closer to you and your family. Don't squander it. Brides: Expecting (and Engaged!) Celebrities Unsupportive In-Laws Sometimes, you strike out in the in-law game, also known as the difficult and unsupportive in-laws. Not only do your fianc's parents object to everything you're doing around the wedding, they're also degrading about your choices. No conversation feels productive -- it seems to be an excuse for your in-laws to criticize you and your fianc about how you spend your money or how offensive it is that you've excluded a third cousin twice removed from the guest list. Brides: The Most Beautiful Honeymoon Destinations  It's important to remember that these strains over your wedding have nothing to do with the wedding. There are clearly much deeper family-related issues at hand. Instead of fighting over wedding-related issues with them, it's time for a broader existential conversation with your fianc. Does he want his parents in your life? If so, he needs to invest ample time into understanding what drives his parents' difficult approach with the two of you. Is it something about the marriage itself? Something between son and parents? Ultimately your fianc has to be your advocate with his parents. He has to sort out what's really going on and what needs to be addressed so that all of you can get along  long after the wedding is over. Was it smooth sailing with your new in-laws or did you have to weather some storms? Tell us in the comments, on Twitter @CNNLiving or on CNN Living's Facebook page!

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/19/living/boston-gender-pay-gap-meeting/index.html	living	Gender pay gap: How Boston hopes to be the first to eliminate it - CNN.com	2014/05/19	Monday May 19 12:06:39 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. She is a mom of two. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter. (CNN) -- There's been plenty of talk about the gender pay gap in recent days after speculation that recently fired New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson was let go after speaking up about possible pay disparity between her and the previous executive editor, Bill Keller. In response to that talk, the New York Times publisher, in a lengthy statement over the weekend, said Abramson's total "pay package," which included stock and other compensation in addition to salary, was "comparable" to Keller's and was, in fact, more than 10% higher during Abramson's last year, and that her removal was due to her management of the newsroom, nothing else. Until we hear Abramson's side of the story, it remains unclear what role, if any, an alleged pay gap played in her fate. What is clear is how outraged women were hearing that the Times' first woman executive editor could be making less than the last male executive editor. It was another reminder, to many women, that the income gap is alive and well. But if one city gets its way, that disparity between what men and women earn will become a thing of the past. Boston has pledged to become the first city in the country to eliminate the gender pay gap. It's certainly a lofty goal: How on Earth will Beantown make it happen? OPINION: Don't believe the hype: In real world, women still make less than men  On Monday, at a White House regional conference on working families in Boston, administration officials along with members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation, including Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, joined business leaders and academics, to tout the city's ambitious plan and what it will take to succeed. The event is one of several this spring leading up to a summit with President Obama at the end of June at the White House. "What's really significant is that Boston recognizes that this isn't just an issue of fairness and isn't just an issue of equity as a moral value," said Betsey Stevenson, a member of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, in an interview. "This is about competitiveness and having a competitive advantage." Women make up about half the labor force but will soon represent more than half of the highly educated labor force, said Stevenson, who will be speaking at the Boston conference. "That's why it becomes an issue of competitiveness. The amount of talent that is in that other half that you're ignoring is relevant and when you have a lot of the talent in that other half, ignoring it is going to become even more costly over time," said Stevenson, who is currently on leave from her position as associate professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan. READ: No movement for women at the top in corporate America Making Boston the 'premier city for working women' Last year, then Boston Mayor Thomas Menino pledged to make Boston the "premier city for working women." He created a Women's Workforce Council, made up of leaders in academia and the public and private sectors. Victoria A. Budson, executive director of the Women and Public Policy Program at Harvard Kennedy School, is a member of the council. "When you make a city good for women, you raise the economic profile of that city. You are going to retain talent," said Budson. Women outnumber men in Boston at 52% of the population, according to a report by the Women's Workforce Council. The city also has the largest proportion of young women between the ages of 20 and 34 of any major city, and has a higher percentage of college educated women than any other metro area. And yet, the city has a significant pay gap, although it's lower than the national average. In 2011, working female residents of Boston earned 83% of what male residents in Boston earned, according to the report. Nationwide, women earn 77 cents for every dollar men make. Boston is asking companies to voluntarily sign a compact committing to take steps to reduce the wage gap. About 50 companies, including some of the city's biggest employers such as Raytheon and State Street, have signed it. READ: What changes with women in the boardroom? The council's report includes 33 different "interventions" companies can take to close the wage gap, from evaluating why mothers and non-mothers leave their businesses to standardizing compensation including bonuses to actively recruiting women to executive level and board positions. "We've made it easy," said Budson, who was recognized in our recent CNN 10: Visionary Women special coverage for her work trying to eliminate the income disparity between men and women. "We're not saying: 'Go make it equal -- figure it out.' We're saying: 'Here's a plan and a set of strategic goals. Pick some. Help your businesses grow.' " The approach, she hopes, can serve as a model for cities around the country and the world. Just last month, Budson traveled to Paris to present what Boston is doing to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. "Rather than a regulation," said Budson, it's a "nudge." What happens when women negotiate  For many women, taking steps themselves to close their own personal income gap makes them incredibly uncomfortable. According to an iVillage.com survey last year of 1,500 women, only 35% said they ever asked for a raise. That's even more significant based on the finding that of those who were unhappy at work, 63% said the number one reason was because they felt they were underpaid. READ: More people prefer a male boss, but gender gap is narrowing There is a reason our discomfort is not unwarranted. According to Budson, the research shows that when women are given an offer and negotiate that offer, or when they are paid a certain amount and they want to negotiate their salary, people tend to want to work with them less. "Women are expected to be relational and when they say, 'I think my value is X,' people might say, 'Hmmm, why are they asking? I don't feel so comfortable with that,' and it usually causes social backlash," said Budson. Whether or not Abramson faced some backlash for confronting her superiors over her compensation and whether that contributed in even the slightest way to her firing, we'll probably never know but, said Budson, it "fits the pattern." Read about Abramson's commencement address Monday  Jena Abernathy, a senior partner at the executive search firm, Witt/Kieffer, said there is a double standard when it comes to how men and women sit down and discussion compensation. She said the best advice for women is to keep track of their successes and then find the right way to make their case. "Being able to sit down at the right time, at the right moment, to say ... 'How can we close this gap? What do we need to do?' "You need to do it in a way that's not threatening," said Abernathy. "There is an art to this." OPINION: Was Jill Abramson fired because she is a woman? What do you think it will take to eliminate the gender pay gap?

She's a mom of two girls and lives in Manhattan. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter. (CNN) -- Sarah Cymbaluk of Fosston, Minnesota, is a frustrated mom who took matters into her own hands. After claiming that her daughter was repeatedly bullied on the school bus and the school did nothing about it, she posted a video on Facebook. In the video, Cymbaluk asked her crying daughter, "Tell me how it makes you feel." Her daughter, who turned 9 on Tuesday, responded, "It makes me feel sad and scared, and I don't like it." "She's been called into the principal's (office) and made to feel like it's her fault," Cymbaluk told CNN affiliate KXJB, claiming the bullying has gone on since December. "She's been told to ignore it. She's been told to disregard it. Basically she's been told to stuff her emotions and get on with life." Fosston Schools Superintendent Mark Nohner, who said he thinks the situation could have been resolved without going to Facebook, said he learned about this issue only recently but conceded "somewhere along the line" the case "fell through the cracks."  Are we too quick to cry 'bully' these days? "And so we need to review our procedures and policies and maybe do a better job of articulating to the parents what we're doing," said Nohner. While Cymbaluk has come under some fire for posting the video of her tearful daughter, this case demonstrates how angry and helpless parents can feel when they believe their child is being bullied and that nothing is being done to stop it. 'You want to do something to help your child' Becki Cohn-Vargas, a parent of three grown children, is a former principal, superintendent and teacher with more than two decades of experience in education. She is now director of Not in Our School, a program that works to create networks of schools that are free of bullying and offers a guide to parents on how to deal with bullying behavior. "Without knowing all the details of the case, what I can say is that I can understand a parent's frustration because I, as a parent, have moved my child from a school ... so I know that you feel desperate," said Cohn-Vargas, who transferred her own daughter to another high school years ago because of a bullying incident. "You want to do something to help your child." Police file raises questions about Rebecca Sedwick's suicide  The key is focusing on the most effective methods to make sure your child feels safe. That begins with talking with your child and determining whether they have, in fact, been bullied, she says. "It isn't supportive to your child to just jump in and defend when you don't know exactly what happened," said Cohn-Vargas, co-author of the book "Identity Safe Classrooms: Places to Belong and Learn," who says she's had her share of experiences as a principal with parents coming in with "guns blazing." "I had so many cases where parents ... felt like they had to defend their child because they thought that was support." Parents might first encourage children to try and handle the situation by standing up for themselves and telling the bully to stop. If that doesn't work, the next stage would be working up through the chain of command, said Cohn-Vargas, beginning with the person closest to where the alleged bullying took place, such as a teacher if it took place in the classroom or a bus driver if the incident happened on a bus and then moving on to the principal and the school district. "I am not trying to underestimate that it's hard because school districts sometimes put their head in the sand, they don't want to see what's happening, but I think more and more school districts are very pro-active," said Cohn-Vargas. When friends become bullies 'Document, document, document' Nancy Willard, director of the group Embrace Civility in the Digital Age, which works on combating cyberbullying and author of "Positive Relations @ School (& Elsewhere)," doesn't totally agree. She says she hears from far too many parents who say schools are rationalizing bullying behavior, saying things like "It wasn't that big of a deal" or "You're overreacting" or "Your kid needs to learn how to deal with it." Willard, who has created her own empowerment guide for parents, says her first advice is to "document, document, document." Parents should chronicle what happens, what staff were around and what they did, what the impact has been in terms of emotional distress, how the alleged bullying behavior may be interfering with the child's education and after-school activities and what the school response has been, said Willard. If the school is not responding, a parent can go the person charged with responsibility for ensuring safe schools at the district level, she said. "If you don't get help at the district level, then you go to the State Department of Education." Parents, beware of bullying on sites you've never seen  If a child is being bullied and there is a civil rights violation, a parent can file a civil rights complaint either at the state or federal level, she added. "Parents need to know that they have more power," said Willard. A focus on reconciliation, not punishment She said parents should not be focused on punishment, which could lead to retaliation and more pain for the bullied child. Instead, they should ask the school to see that the person responsible for the hurtful behavior gets help since other problems may be pushing them to bully and work with the school to create an opportunity, at some point, for the child who caused the pain to make amends. Cohn-Vargas adds that parents should refrain from immediately trying to schedule a meeting with the parents of the child doing the bullying. "It's because it can turn into conflict between adults," she said. "It just can get ugly really fast." Willard said part of the reason why she created her parent guide in the first place is because she believes parents can help schools make positive change. "If we've got 1.2 million kids who are experiencing hurtful acts at school each week, that's a fair number of parents who if they got motivated could encourage and empower change," she said, citing numbers from a 2011 Department of Justice report. Cohn-Vargas believes schools and school districts are "in the beginning stages of addressing bullying effectively." She believes only a multifaceted approach will succeed -- one that includes empowering students to identify issues and solutions, teaching bystanders to stand up against bullying and looking at bullying as a learning experience where kids can move on and change. She cited a recent case involving a middle school, which worked with her program, Not in Our School. Three boys photoshopped a picture of an eighth- grade girl, adding a swastika, a naked image and an anti-gay slur, and circulated the photo. When telling bullying victims to 'just fight back' doesn't work  School officials identified three students were responsible, including one Jewish student, and wanted the children to really learn from the incident. They came up with the idea of having the students do research on the topics involved including the history of the swastika, said Cohn-Vargas. "So what does the school do to handle it right? They take it seriously, they investigate. They look at it as a learning experience," she said. "All children at some point end up being either a victim, a bystander or someone who does the bullying and so it's a matter of creating a learning opportunity for the kids."

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/16/living/brown-v-board-60th-anniversary-spelman-identity/index.html	living	60 years after Brown v. Board, still separate - is equal possible? - CNN.com	2014/05/16	Friday May 16 06:59:32 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Beverly Daniel Tatum is the president of Spelman College in Atlanta and the author of "Can We Talk About Race?" and Other Conversations in an Era of School Resegregation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- I was born in Tallahassee, Florida, in 1954, the year of the landmark school desegregation case, Brown v. Board of Education. The struggle for integration has shaped my life from the very beginning. When my father, an art professor at Florida A&M University, sought to pursue his doctorate in art education at Florida State University, the state of Florida chose to pay his transportation to Penn State rather than open its doors to an African-American graduate student. In 1957, he completed his degree at Penn State, and in 1958 became the first African-American professor at Bridgewater State College, now Bridgewater State University, in Massachusetts, where I grew up. My parents were part of the great migration, moving to the North to escape segregation. They achieved their goal. My three siblings and I attended predominantly white public schools in our small Massachusetts town without protest or high court drama, and graduated well-prepared for the colleges we all attended. Forty-four years later, in 2002, my husband and I left Massachusetts and returned to the South -- initiating our family's reverse migration. Eventually our sons, and even my parents, moved to Atlanta, too. They returned to a region very different than the one they remembered. Fifty years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, their choice of housing and their freedom of movement are unencumbered by race. But 60 years after racial segregation was outlawed in schools, public education is again segregating along racial lines. And not just in the South, but across the United States. Schools are more segregated today than in the 1980s, according to a new report released by researchers at UCLA's Civil Rights Project, "Brown at 60: Great Progress, a Long Retreat and Uncertain Future." This is the result of continued patterns of residential segregation, and a series of Supreme Court decisions that have quietly undermined the implementation of Brown through a shift away from court-ordered busing and other mandated desegregation strategies. As school districts move back to "neighborhood school" policies, white students will likely have less school contact with people of color than their parents had. Particularly for young white children, interaction with people of color is likely to be a virtual reality rather than an actual one, with media images (often negative ones) most clearly shaping their attitudes and perceived knowledge of communities of color. For students of color, the return to segregation means the increased likelihood of attending a school with limited resources. Most highly segregated black and Latino schools have high percentages of poor children. At most highly segregated white schools, middle-class students are in the majority. The negative educational impact of attending high-poverty schools is well-documented. Whether a student comes from a poor or middle-income family, academic achievement is likely to decline if the student attends a high-poverty school. Conversely, academic performance is likely to improve if the student attends a middle-class school, even if his or her own family is poor. The learning conditions which are taken for granted in middle-class suburban schools are too often absent in impoverished classrooms. It is not surprising that the outcomes associated with high-poverty schools across the country are bleak: lower test scores, higher dropout rates, fewer course offerings and low levels of college attendance. If we remember that the original impetus for the Brown lawsuit was not simply a symbolic fight for the acknowledgment of the equality of all children, but a struggle for equal access to publicly funded educational resources, we can see that the struggle continues. So, what must we do? In particular, white children will need to be in schools that are intentional about helping them understand social justice issues like prejudice, discrimination and racism, empowering them to think critically about the stereotypes to which they are exposed in the culture. Such tools are needed to help them acquire the social skills necessary to function effectively in a diverse world, and are essential for continued progress in a society still struggling to disentangle the racism woven into the fabric of its founding. The hopeful news is that there are educators around the country working hard to create anti-racist classrooms and learning environments even when their classrooms are predominantly white. Children of color in under-resourced, racially isolated schools also need these same tools. But they will also require powerful advocates to insure that they have committed and well-trained teachers, a challenging curriculum and the educational resources needed to inspire their own striving for excellence. Providing these resources equitably is a daunting task, one that has never been accomplished in the history of education in the United States. Yet we fail to do it at our own peril. In 2014, the question we all must ask is: How do we build strong school communities where every student, regardless of race, is supported to achieve his or her personal best, and teach the skills needed to live in healthy, democratic society? When we can answer that question, the promise of Brown v. Board of Education will be fulfilled.

She is a mom of two. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter. This column has been updated since its original publication. (CNN) -- Just when you thought you'd heard everything. A 17-year-old high school senior who was attending a prom for homeschoolers this weekend near Richmond, Virginia, got kicked out, she says, because she was told her dress was too short. In a blog post detailing what happened and showing a photo of her wearing the dress she claims conformed to the dress code, the student named Clare says she was also told there were other concerns. Some of the dads who were chaperoning the prom had complained that her dancing "was too provocative" and that she was going to "cause the young men at the prom to think impure thoughts." Really? That isn't much of a stretch from "she asked for it" when we blame victims of sexual assault for what they were wearing. Are the thoughts and actions of young men and their fathers really her responsibility? CNN affiliate WTVR reached out to the organizers of the prom, who provided the following response: "The Richmond Homeschool Prom has been a part of a long and wonderful tradition in the Richmond area for over 8 years. The prom is an opportunity to provide over 500 young adults from all over the Richmond area and surrounding counties with a prom. We regret that any individuals were dissatisfied with their experience this year." The case, while outrageous on many levels, does illustrate the potent mix of prom angst this time of year with teenage girls shopping for the perfect dress, selections bordering on the wildly inappropriate to many parents, and a culture sexualizing girls at younger and younger ages. Plenty of reasons to be anxious Can I just say right here I'm already freaking out and my girls, 6 and 8, are years away from prom time? "16, 17, 18-year-olds should not be in dresses with thigh-high slits, necklines that plunge precariously close to the belly button, backs that are cut so low as to expose butt dimples," said a mother named Judith on CNN's Facebook page. "Parents need to step in and stop this 'beyond the age' dressing." What happens if you say no to a promposal? In some cases, like the prom mentioned above in Virginia, schools are not leaving it up to the parents and are imposing their own dress codes for prom. Some are going to extra lengths to clarify what's acceptable. One Northern California Catholic high school sent an e-mail to parents announcing that attire for junior and senior prom should "be moderate and reflect pride in both the person and the school." The e-mail, obtained by CNN, included pictures of dresses deemed acceptable and those considered inappropriate. On the banned list were low-cut and backless dresses and dresses with very high hemlines. Holly Manson, a mom of three teens in Oakland, Maine, doesn't think dress codes are the answer. "I know the town over from us requires that their dresses have a strap," she said with a laugh. "It has to have a strap, but it's OK if it comes up to their butt cheek." Too hot for tweens: Some parents dread back-to-school shopping According to the teen who says she was booted from prom in Virginia, her gown met the prom's dress code, which called for dresses "fingertip length or longer." That means the dress must be longer than your fingertips once you have your hands at your side. At 5' 9," she said, dresses might look shorter on her than on other girls. As for the "provocative" dance moves, she added that she hadn't been dancing at all. "Enough with the slut shaming," Clare wrote in her post. "I'm not responsible for some perverted 45 year old dad lusting after me because I have a sparkly dress on." "And if you think I am, then maybe you're part of the problem." Boys don't have many variations on the traditional tux to choose from when planning prom attire, so they typically don't have to deal with the harsh judgment and disrespect that girls such as Clare face because of their clothing choices. But when kids dress in ways that are gender nonconforming, or even when a boy wants to wear a kilt, it doesn't always go over well with school administrators either. Parents and teens: Not enough choices  Another frustration I heard from parents and even some teens is that there just aren't enough moderate options -- both in terms of sexiness and price -- available in stores and online. "I would say the problem is ... that a girl who has sort of a more modern taste ... if (the dresses) are for someone her age, they're too short. They're shorter than they should be," said a mom of two teens, who said it can be extra difficult for tall girls or girls of different body types to find dresses schools deem appropriate. Dresses can also cost hundreds of dollars, which most parents either can't pay or won't pay, she added.   Georgia school hosts first racially integrated prom A 17-year-old named Angela says it's not that most teenagers want to wear revealing prom dresses. It's because they often have no other choice. "I feel as if it is not that teenage tastes have grown 'too sexy' but that the fashion market as a whole encourages young people to dress in a provocative way," she said via e-mail. "When I go to department stores, the majority of prom dresses there seem to have some sort of cut-out on the back or the sides. Otherwise, they are completely unflattering," Angela added. But an editor at Seventeen magazine, which just released its 291-page annual prom issue, says there are plenty of options. Helping teens build a positive body image "There literally is something for everyone, for every body type, for any kind of school regulation, if you have rules or dress codes, anything like that," said Jasmine Snow, accessories editor for Seventeen. "I think it's just about finding the right resources," she said, suggesting Seventeen's dress guide, which includes many style options. The key, says Snow, is for a girl to find a dress she'll feel good and confident wearing. "It also has to be something that your parents feel good about having you wear as well, and I think it's about having that compromise between the parent and the teenager." So many parents, this reporter among them, are concerned about how our girls are growing up so much faster than when we were kids. Clearly, we can't blame prom dresses as the single cause, but they're a factor. "Clothing definitely plays a role in the sexualization of our girls, so from prom dresses to starter bras to shorts, I believe we need to show our girls a broader range of options so they can choose the style that works for them," said Sharon Choksi, a mom of two in Austin, Texas, who got so fed up with the "short shorts" and "teeny bikinis" she started her own clothing company, Girls Will Be. "Girls today receive so many messages that they should focus on their appearance and act more grown-up. I don't want my daughter thinking that is what is most important and is how people will value her," said Choksi. What happens when you put your fears aside Not every parent considers shopping for a teenage daughter's prom dress about as welcome as, let's say, a root canal, doing taxes or cleaning the bathroom. "As a single dad, the entire prom experience was just one more experience I actually looked forward to with my daughter," said Jim Higley, an award-winning author and national fatherhood advocate. "Clothes shopping, shoe shopping -- all the things that are important to my daughter -- they're important to me," the father of three and author of the book "Bobblehead Dad" said. For Tracey Clark of Huntington Beach, California, a mom of two girls and a Babble.com contributor, shopping for prom and other school dance dresses has been so positive she even posted a video online of one of her shopping excursions with her 16-year-old daughter. She credits her happy experiences with planning (they shop for dresses very far in advance) and plain luck. Her daughter has kind of a retro style and doesn't gravitate to the provocative stuff, said Clark, who hosts a blog in her own name and contributes photographs to the collaborative blog Shutter Sisters. Pink, princess-y and sexy too soon "But there are dresses where I'm like, 'Babe, I know you don't like short short things on you and this one from the back looks short short,'" said Clark. Growing up with a "strict and traditional" mother, Clark said she often felt like she didn't fit in because of what she was and was not allowed to wear. She's mindful of that when it comes to her daughters' fashion choices. "I always want to be really careful that I'm not taking something from them that makes them feel normal," she said.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/13/living/levar-burton-reading-rainbow-app/index.html	living	LeVar Burton breathes new life into 'Reading Rainbow' through app - CNN.com	2014/05/13	Tuesday May 13 12:54:34 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- "Reading Rainbow" made its TV debut in 1983 with a simple idea: Use television to keep kids reading during summer by urging them to "take a look" in a book. The popular public television show ended its run in 2009, but host and actor LeVar Burton hasn't stepped away from children's literacy, or the ideas behind the beloved show. "If you are a reader, then you have the ability to educate yourself," Burton said. "When you have the ability to be a lifelong learner, there are no limits on what you can acquire in terms of knowledge and information. It represents the ultimate freedom of mankind." This week, Burton will be recognized with the Impact Award for his efforts to instill "a lifelong love of reading in children" at the seventh Children's Book Week Gala hosted by the Children's Book Council and Every Child a Reader. While Burton has drawn critical and popular acclaim for his acting in "Roots" and "Star Trek: The Next Generation," he said he wants "Reading Rainbow" to be his legacy. After all, what makes a good story hasn't changed much since "Reading Rainbow's" debut, Burton said. Technology has. Burton said he realized the power of TV as a medium for educating and informing viewers when he played Kunta Kinte on the "Roots" miniseries, based on Alex Haley's novel about slavery and African-American history. The story captured the nation as millions tuned in to watch the miniseries during the late 1970s. Decades later, after reading a book on an iPad for the first time, he saw the potential to create an interactive reading experience. Burton acquired the rights to the "Reading Rainbow" brand and created his company, RRKidz. He envisioned an app that could interact with the audience in ways the show never could. He launched the "Reading Rainbow" app in 2012, and in its first 18 months, users read 10 million books, making it the No. 1 free educational app in the iTunes store for two years. "I wanted to put in the hands of kids a library of books and videos, like the TV show did, all in the service of inspiring a love of literature and exploring the world -- connecting the real world to the literature that kids are reading," Burton said. Burton's efforts come at a time when researchers and educators are trying to figure out how to use technology to encourage reading. Since 1984, the proportion of adolescents who read for pleasure once a week or more has dropped from 81% to 76% among 9-year-olds, according to research released this week by advocacy group Common Sense Media. Among 13-year-olds, rates of reading for pleasure have dropped from 70% to 53%. Among 17-year-olds, the rate dropped from 64% to 40%. The proportion who say they "never" or "hardly ever" read has gone from 8% of 13-year-olds and 9% of 17-year-olds in 1984 to 22% and 27%, respectively. "E-reading has the potential to significantly change the nature of reading for children and families, but its impact is still unknown," said the Common Sense Media report "Children, Teens and Reading." On the TV show, Burton became a trusted friend to children, parents and educators, recommending a variety of books and taking viewers on book-related field trips. He invited kids to recommend books in a segment, using the famous line, "but you don't have to take my word for it." "The books were enhanced by the show and the show brought people to read the books," said Starr LaTronica, president of the Association for Library Service to Children. "It sort of lays the groundwork for research later in life because LeVar always took those books, found out something about them and went further." In the new incarnation of "Reading Rainbow," children navigate the app in a virtual hot air balloon, traveling to themed islands and discovering books they might like to read. The app hosts more than 500 books and video field trips with Burton. Users can interact with the stories like it's a game and receive rewards for each book they read. Parents are encouraged to use the app along with their children, filling in youngsters' interests for reading recommendations or exploring lessons and themes within the books together. Kids can read by themselves, with their parents or have Burton narrate. The app is free to download, with a $9.99 monthly or $29.99 six-month fee for accessing and downloading unlimited books to read. "Elementary school-age children are at a juncture where you have such a great opportunity to capture them as readers at that point," said Nicole Deming of the Children's Book Council. "The app has struck that ideal balance between enhancing the storytelling without being distracting." Burton said he hopes to expand beyond the "Reading Rainbow" app available now. The next move? Creating a version for teachers to use in the classroom, including lesson plans and tools to track student progress. Burton said he also would like to see more diversity in children's literature. "Reading Rainbow" will continue to share a variety of books, just as he did on the show, he said. "I firmly believe that seeing oneself reflected in the popular culture is critically important for developing a solid and healthy sense of self," he said. "Unless the publishing industry is proactive, this will be one of the causes of its demise. I don't understand the reluctance. Here is a sector that is woefully underserved, with an opportunity to target a market that is thirsty for literature." Still, not everything has changed. Just as Burton's mother nurtured his interest in reading, parents and children can bond through books, whether on paper or tablets. "There is nothing more powerful to me than that elemental experience of storytelling: being read to aloud, following along, seeing the story in the pictures and feeling it in your heart," Burton said. "It is really beautifully, brilliantly embodied in the sharing of a children's book." What were your favorite books as a young reader?

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/14/living/how-kids-see-michael-sam-gq-parents/index.html	living	Explaining Michael Sam to a 7-year-old - CNN.com	2014/05/14	Wednesday May 14 04:25:03 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- My son has 15 different NFL jerseys, most of which his mother purchased for $3 each at a thrift store. Popular jerseys never make it to the thrift store, which means Max is usually sporting a frayed and ill-fitting schmata advertising a retired player like Donovan McNabb or Priest Holmes, or one you assume had retired like Willis McGahee. He's got players no one likes, players no one remembers, and a player shot to death in a burglary gone wrong. The kid doesn't discriminate based on team, status or even vital signs. He loves football more than anything and it's impossible not to admire his blanket enthusiasm. READ: The undefeated Little League champs from America's most dangerous city Then again, this is a first-grader we're talking about. Max still believes in the tooth fairy and can't wipe his own ass with any kind of proficiency. So, you can imagine we hadn't really had much of a talk about the birds, to say nothing of the bees, when Michael Sam came along earlier this year, big and gay and proud and impossible for a football fan to ignore, even when the fan in question is a half-baked, illiterate thumb-sucker. READ: The 10 habits of highly unflabby people I suppose it helps that Max is a liberal. That may sound perverse, considering he's 7 and not old enough to understand the average Adam Sandler movie, let alone gay rights. But the kid's growing up in a liberal family in a liberal city where he goes to a bleeding-heart private school with other kids whose political leanings have been predetermined since they were hoisting sippy cups. When our upstairs neighbors, Brad and Peter, got married recently, Max's only confusion over the arrangement stemmed from an assumption that they always had been married. READ: Eat healthy all week for just $60 So the Michael Sam conversation in our home wasn't some awkward dance about the existence of real, actual homosexuals in the world, a fact my son already understands and accepts. What he didn't get was why this qualified as a big deal. While the rest of us wrung our hands and debated how this would affect the delicate balance of the manliest locker rooms of America's manliest sport -- or how Michael Sam could possibly thrive in a spotlight so bright for an audience so potentially hostile -- this is how my conversation with Max went. Do you know what gay is? Max: It means you're a man and you like men. Right. Well, Michael Sam, this player from the University of Missouri who wants to play in the NFL, is gay.  Max: OK. And he just told everyone. Max: OK. Is he the only one in the NFL who likes men? No. Max: Does Jay Cutler? I don't think so. Max: Why does it matter? It doesn't. Max: So ... why -- what's the big deal? Because he's the first one who has told everybody. Max: The others are keeping secrets? Yes. Because some people out there don't like gay people.  (long pause) Max: Is he any good? This, I suspect, will be the next generation of American sports fan. The one who shrugs at gay, because gay is just another kind of person, like tall or bald or funny or mean. Max's upbringing may not be typical, but his response -- is he any good? -- seemed right to me. It's basically the same response that his potential teammates and opponents in the NFL have exhibited, professionals who don't have time or interest in anything other than: Can he play? The answer, of course, was yes. He was All-American, the SEC Defensive Player of the Year when he came out. Which was what made him so terrifying to the bigots -- it wasn't just the chance that he'd end up in the NFL, it was the idea that he could be a team's first pick, that a franchise they root for could actively decide to become The Team With the Gay Player. Which might explain why the anti-Sam campaign began almost immediately, the chorus of he's not necessarily a useful choice for a lot of teams, or if you look at his stats, he's not really that great. In the end, 248 players were picked before him. I'm not suggesting we treat Michael Sam as though he's not newsworthy, an approach that contains its own stealth homophobia. When bigots are no longer free to publicly complain about the queers ruining their game, they say things like, "Who cares?" and "Why is this even news?" then they spit their venom onto a safer source: the media, which they accuse of pushing an agenda and pillory for turning the story into a publicity circus. But we should pay attention to the conversation -- to the subtle ways that it diverges from the one I had with my 7-year-old son. When they said Sam wouldn't be drafted because no team would want to deal with the distraction, what they meant was they hoped their team didn't pick him. Are they breathing a sigh of relief now that the Rams are "the gay team"? And what of the players like University of Texas' Case McCoy, who's so open in his prejudice that he took to Twitter to express disgust at one of the most heartwarming moments in the history of sports? Surely McCoy is wishing this whole gay thing would just go away, before he has to play against a guy like Sam, or join him in an NFL locker room. But it won't. Even if Sam warms the bench and gets traded next year, where a whole new fan base has to reevaluate their priorities, it won't go away. If Michael Sam flops, another player will come out, then another and even the most intolerant among us will have to have to deal with the notion that Gay People Are Everywhere. It's obvious that those who still cling to pro football as the last place in America where Boys Can Be Boys, a cozy man cave where they don't have to confront thorny issues like homosexuality, now find themselves confused and angry. They hear about Michael Sam and they feel uncomfortable about the way the world is changing, and they wonder about their place in it. When these fans say they don't care who a player sleeps with so long as he comes to play on Sunday, the subtext is: Don't push this gay stuff in my face and ruin the game I love. When Max says he doesn't care, he means: Do I still get to watch football on Sundays? How did the young football fans in your house react to Michael Sam being drafted?

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/09/living/motherhood-now-vs-then-parents/index.html	living	Longing for the carefree parenting of yesterday? - CNN.com	2014/05/09	Friday May 9 09:16:47 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. She's a mom of two girls and lives in Manhattan. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter. (CNN) -- When Betty Draper of "Mad Men" lit a cigarette on her son's school bus during a class trip in a recent episode, I cracked up. After all, the prospect of a 2014 mom smoking around her child's classmates is about as likely as teens giving up their smartphones. Motherhood has changed a lot since I grew up in the 1960s. Back then, women smoke and drank during pregnancy. (My mom says she even smoked in the hospital after delivering my sisters and me.) Today, expecting women add sushi and lunch meat to their alcohol and smoking bans. Back then, Dr. Spock was the only guide for child-rearing. Today, there are too many manuals to count and Google is just a click away from parental questions answered. Back then, we didn't have playdates. "You went out in the yard or you went out in the street and played," my mom told me with a chuckle. Today, my kids have piano, soccer, basketball, gymnastics and hip-hop dance. How do you spell overscheduled? READ: 7 things mom didn't tell us about growing gray In conversations with moms raising children today and moms who had kids in the 1960s, '70s and '80s, they all agreed that motherhood is a whole lot different nowadays. The question is, has it changed for the better or worse? 'Less of that judgment' Lyz Lenz, a mom of two in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, says part of her wishes she was raising children in the early '80s, like her mom. "I feel like in that pre-Internet era we weren't quite as exposed to other people's pet peeves," said Lenz, who writes a blog in her own name. "There was less of that judgment and less of other people making you insecure. You didn't have to hop on Facebook and see a ton of different people telling you why giving your kid a processed cookie is child abuse." What's different today, says Joanna Mazewski, a mom of two in Coconut Creek, Florida, is the level of paranoia. "It seems like mothers these days are definitely more paranoid and uptight about every little detail of their children's lives, much more than they were 30, 40 years ago," said Mazewski, a Babble.com contributor.  "It just seems that parenthood altogether was much simpler without the education that we have now and the devices ... to be honest with you, I think I prefer the carefree method more than scared-of-everything-we-eat-and-even-our-shadows." READ: She wasn't mom but she loved us  From Dr. Spock to Tiger Mom Jeannette Kaplun, another Babble.com contributor, said the problem is that parents today suffer from "information overload." Dr. Spock was "the bible for parents," when she was born in the 1970s, said the Miami mom of two and host of a bilingual blog called Hispana Global. "Now you have attachment parenting, then you have 'tiger moms,' and people tell you to co-sleep. Others tell you that you are a terrible parent if you co-sleep ... and pediatricians will tell you one thing and then people will search online and they'll find a blog that says completely the opposite and so it's very confusing." Google can be a friend for today's parents, but it also can be a foe, said Lenz, the mom from Cedar Rapids, who shared a story about how she went online late one night when she wasn't able to calm her crying daughter. "I'm like, 'Oh no, maybe she has brain trauma or stomach problems,' and then it's like, 'Oh. No. She's just teething.' " READ: I'm OK with only having one child Ironically, Lenz's mom, Ellen Baranowski, who raised Lyz and her seven siblings starting in the early '80s, thinks the 24/7 access to information is one of the biggest and best parenting differences from when she was a mother. "I think it's great being able to access the Internet at 2 o'clock in the morning when you are just scared to death," Ellen Baranowski said. Janis Brett Elspas, a mom of four in Los Angeles and host of the blog Mommy Blog Expert, said technology can be very powerful for parents today -- when it's used properly. "It's almost like the Life Magazine of this century in that we're totally learning from each other's experiences through the Internet," she said. Less freedom, more schedules Another difference between parenting then and now, moms say, is a loss of freedom and independence during childhood. When Baranowksi and her family moved to a small town in South Dakota from Dallas, she felt comfortable letting her children roam the neighborhood without her. "My kids then could walk to the swimming pool by themselves, and do things that I had no idea what they were doing," the mom of eight said. Today, there's none of that. "My grandkids are getting so scheduled and I understand why," she said. "This is not a complaint on their parenting ... they can't have just unattended moments and it's sad." READ: The photo that changed a teen's life Shannon Bradley-Colleary, a mom of two in Los Angeles who grew up in the '60s and '70s, remembers playing outside by herself as a kid. "A lot of my favorite memories were playing 'war' ... until well after dark with no one even calling to see where I was. So do you think it was neglectful parenting?" the host of the blog The Woman Formerly Known as Beautiful said with a laugh. She concedes there is a definite tradeoff between safety and independence in today's parenting. In her opinion, the tighter control is better, ultimately. "I just think there's a pendulum swing or backlash from those of us raised in the late '60s, early '70s, which was that we were really left to our own devices, and what was great about that, was there was a feeling of autonomy and self-direction," she said. "But there was a much greater risk." 'You're all so concerned with keeping the kids busy' During my first-ever interview of my mom, Judy Wallace of Long Island, New York, I asked her to compare parenting back in the '60s and '70s, when she raised my sisters and me, with parenting today. "The biggest difference is that I feel like you're all so concerned with keeping the kids busy, taking them everyplace and having to take up all their time with activities, where in the '60s, that wasn't the case," she said. "When you were little, you would go out and play with your friends, you kind of entertained yourself more than the parents nowadays, who are constantly trying to entertain the kids." READ: Being a good mom can get you fired But why did we move from the carefree, laissez-faire parenting of the '60s and '70s to the more frenetic helicopter approach of today? "The reality is now we know more about what happens in the world ... so that obviously increases your perception of the world being much less safe," said Kaplun, the Miami mom of two. It's harder to parent today, says Brett Elspas, especially with the influence of media on our children. "It's very, very hard unless you lead a life in a capsule ... Even if you home school your children, they are going to be exposed to stuff. You can't blind them and cover their ears and lead them through and hope they are going to turn out normally as an adult." It could be hard, but we might reduce our stress and even have more fun if we take some notes from our own moms. We need to let our kids chart their own course and make their own mistakes, said Mazewski, the Coconut Creek mom of two. "I've seen toddlers that are already on vegan diets. It's like, 'You've got to allow them to make their own decisions.'" A little wisdom from my own mom: "Kids have to learn disappointment, that they can't have everything and they can't do everything and they can't be good at everything." What do you think are the biggest differences between parenting today and back in the '60s, '70s or '80s? Chime in in the comments below or tell Kelly Wallace on Twitter and CNN Living on Facebook.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/07/living/race-sterling-identity/index.html	living	Donald Sterling racism is only part of the racial equity conversation - CNN.com	2014/05/07	Wednesday May 7 09:10:06 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Rinku Sen is the president and executive director of Race Forward: The Center for Racial Justice Innovation, and the publisher of Colorlines.com.  (CNN) -- Racism is headline news again. This time, America's conversation on race is focused on whether Donald Sterling is a racist -- and on his apology. But I'm not clear where we go with that conversation: It feels like a never-ending cycle of accusation and defense and less about long-lasting solutions. After all, Sterling is invested in not being seen as a racist and saving his business. When a debate becomes about whether one person is racist, what are the rest of us supposed to do with that? If we want to have a more useful discussion on how to move beyond racism in America, there are more productive ways to do it. First, we have to resist concluding that condemning racist slurs is all that is required to end discrimination. Second, to achieve racial equity, we need to be able to do three things: talk explicitly about race; focus on the impact of policies and practices and the intentions behind them; and support power-building in marginalized communities. Racism has evolved over the past 50 years, and our collective understanding of what constitutes justice, how discrimination functions and how to best address it needs updating. Racial bias is often hidden, unintentional and systemic. That means that it is actually possible to create racist impact, even if there's no easily identifiable racist behind the curtain. The notion that racism is always intentional, individual and overt feeds the false assumption that colorblindness is then the appropriate solution. But the absence of apparent, or even coded, hostility does not necessarily indicate the presence of fairness. That's why we have to be able to ask explicit racial questions. Rather than avoiding racial difference, we should engage it, with the goal of creating actual equity in our workplaces, schools and all the other spaces in which we spend our lives. In the food industry, for example, there is widely accepted racial hierarchy in high-end restaurants. Anyone walking into a three-star restaurant can see that often, the people who have speaking parts at the front of the house are white, while those working for lower wages in the back of the house are employees of color. The Restaurant Opportunities Centers United (ROCUnited) has documented such segregation in New York City, New Orleans and Miami. The organization has challenged prominent restaurant owners and chains to address racial exclusion through new employment practices, which often involve actually formalizing hiring practices such as posting jobs internally first before going external or holding performance reviews. Informality works against equity by making room for all kinds of problematic individual judgments, such as discrimination against applicants with non-European foreign accents. The lack of rules is in itself a kind of policy. A good example is Tom Colicchio, the owner of Craft and a host of "Top Chef." He has a combination of formal employment practices and full intention to build an integrated workforce. Saru Jayaraman of ROCUnited notes that Colicchio "has a good reputation among workers in the industry for being a conscientious employer in this regard, and diners in his restaurants get a visibly different experience of the workforce." An employer's clear intention to make room for people of color and willingness to apply that intention to recruitment, hiring, training and promotion of employee is the combination that enables real change. The second thing we need to create genuine racial equity is to look at the impact of our institutional practices. When the rules of an institution are written down, we call them policies, but unwritten rules also shape institutions, in the form of repeated individual behavior, traditions, rituals or common approaches to problems. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called for the NFL to take a stand against owner Dan Snyder -- who insists on preserving a team name that many consider racially insensitive -- the way the NBA did against Donald Sterling. Snyder has continued to defend his recalcitrance in the name of "tradition" and to prove his lack of animus toward Native people by establishing a foundation. If I stretch, I can accept that Snyder has no real animus toward Native Americans. Yet, the fact is that stereotypical sports mascots dehumanize the people they represent. Holding onto such a symbol bolsters an image of Native people on which other people negatively act. Lastly, we have to recognize that people who have been marginalized need power to generate racial equality. The tools that create the presence of equity, not just the absence of hostility, have little chance of being implemented in situations where people of color are not organized for collective power. One such tool is the Racial Equity Impact Analysis, which allows us to predict bad outcomes and change course. It works like an environmental impact analysis, which requires any building project to account for potential pollution, noise, traffic and other environmental factors. This worked in Minneapolis, when the Education Equity Organizing Collaborative, a coalition of communities of color, pressed the school board to conduct a racial impact review of proposed school closings. In a rare reversal, the analysis led them to cancel the closing of a community school serving Somali students and to expand the school options available to Native Americans. Now, the Minneapolis Board of Education has adopted a policy of conducting impact analysis on all decisions that affect student learning and resource allocation. None of that would have happened if communities of color weren't organizing themselves. If we want racial equity, we have to want that kind of power-building, too. As we debate issues such as voting rights and affirmative action, the effect on a community's ability to assert its interests has to be part of our calculation of what makes good policy. As a nation, we've come a long way on race, as evidenced by the fact that Sterling was not only condemned by individuals but also sanctioned by an institution. There's nothing stopping us from using these news stories to launch a forward-looking, highly effective, unifying approach to our persistent racial problems. We can generate fairness -- not just punish hostility -- if we have the courage to be explicit, focus on the rules and their impact and encourage power building among people of color. That's what it means to be brave. It's an American virtue. We can feel encouraged to see it in action every day, and we should never stop pushing for more. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rinku Sen. 
http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/27/living/anna-quindlen-raising-readers/index.html	living	Raising readers: How to share a love of literature with your kids - CNN.com	2014/04/27	Sunday Apr 27 09:47:53 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Parents, how do you keep your kids learning through the summer? We're looking for advice on summer learning from home schooling families! Share your experiences on CNN iReport! (CNN) -- There's learning to read, and then there's loving to read. As the end of the school year approaches, parents are stockpiling ideas to keep their children on top of those long summer reading lists. But how? Bestselling novelist and renowned nonfiction writer Anna Quindlen raised three avid readers who are also a big part of her work. Her eldest son, Quin Krovatin, now 29, helped research and write her 2004 travelogue, "Imagined London," and her fun and foibles as a parent found their way into her other writing, without exposing too many details about them. ("Books and columns come and go, but your kids are there forever," she said.) Quindlen recently took some time on her tour to promote her new novel, "Still Life with Bread Crumbs," to offer some guidance on raising kids who are passionate about reading. It's never too early to read to children -- and don't stop Quindlen and her husband, Gerald Krovatin, started reading to their three kids from the start. "We read to them from the time they were very little," she said. When Quin was 5, he showed his mother just how much the reading message hit home. "I took him for a school interview, which is a horrid rite of passage in Manhattan. And the interviewer came out and said, 'And how long has he been reading?' And I said, 'Oh he can't read. He's only in kindergarten.' And she said, 'No, he reads.' I thought, 'Oh I'm the world's worst mother.' " She laughed, and continued: "I said, 'Quin? You can read?' He sort of shook his head. And I said, 'Why didn't you tell me?' And he said, 'Because I was afraid you wouldn't read to me anymore.' "So I told him then that I would read to him forever." Just because your children can read, doesn't mean they don't want to share books with their parents. Sharing "Harry Potter" with your children can be even more fun than reading it alone the first time. Make reading the reward Once kids can read by themselves, present books as a treat, rather than a task. Even if their teachers ask them to read at home for 20 minutes a day after school, urge your children to read for an hour or more -- by choice. " 'All right, if you're good tonight, you can read for a half an hour after you get into bed.' If you make reading seem like castor oil, it's no surprise that your kids won't want to do it. If you make it seem like chocolate pudding and a milkshake combined, they will be thrilled to do it," Quindlen said. Be a model reader The more you read yourself, the more children will yearn to read often, too. Fill your home with books, whether on tablets or tables, and make sure your kids see you reading, and enjoying it. Quindlen said her three children grew up seeing their mother behind a book so often that they might ask: " 'What does mom's face look like when there's not a book in front of it? Does anyone remember?' " Be the reader you want your children to become. Match books to children's interests ... Take advantage of the wide range of books for children. Quindlen advises, "If you have a boy who is an indefatigable jock, don't give him 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.' That's not his book. Give him Jane Leavy's biography of Sandy Koufax. Or give him some great young adult novel about a baseball team. Once you know who your kids are, you've got to pick out the books that are right for them." Other reading experts agree that getting children excited about reading involves knowing them well, and choosing books that cater to their interests. "One of the best ways to inspire children to read is to help them find books that speak to them as individuals, so that reading isn't this isolated, fraught activity that they do at school," says Victoria Ford Smith, an assistant professor at the University of Connecticut who specializes in children's literature. "It's an infinitely fertile field to be in." Ford teaches Roald Dahl's books to undergraduates at the University of Connecticut, and cites the author who wrote "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", "Matilda," and many others as one of her favorites. For children who are accustomed to having adults make all of the decisions about their lives, Dahl's stories are a refreshing escape. "He really turns the tables on who has the power in his books," she said. "Usually it's children who are powerful, and adults who are ridiculous." Try something different for parents and kids From Dahl, to Sendak, to Dr. Seuss and others, young readers are spoiled for choice. There's a reason why Dr. Seuss in particular gets a nationwide celebration -- or Seussibration, for those in the know -- on his birthday, March 2: He created a niche with his wacky characters, and accessible writing style. "It's a really simple vocabulary; it's easy to begin to read, if you're a beginning reader, but (the books) still have a really great sense of humor," said Madigan McGillicuddy, a children's librarian in Atlanta. "There is so much packed in there that builds a lifetime love of reading." Children's books have come a long way since the days of "Dick and Jane," which seem a bit stilted next to what's on today's bookshelves. Now, most children's books have intricate illustrations, and wildly imaginative plots. "What mostly attracts me to children's literature is how complex it is," Ford said. "We often have a misconception that children's literature is literature for adults with simpler language, and happy endings." Really, children's literature brings their fears and frustrations to life. Ford cited Maurice Sendak's "Where the Wild Things Are," about a boy who gets sent to bed without his supper, but can imagine a world where he rules a land of wild giants. For parents, revisiting favorite stories from their own childhoods can engage them in reading along with their kids, and inspire them to beg for the next book. As Quindlen said, "I made it seem like reading was the greatest thing since sliced bread because that's how I feel." By the end of the summer, parents and kids who follow her advice might feel the same way. Which books made you want to read more as a child?

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/09/living/wedding-night-matrimony/index.html	living	What really happens on your wedding night - CNN.com	2014/05/09	Friday May 9 09:25:46 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Is the wedding night really all it's cracked up to be? With statistics showing that anywhere from 25% to 52% of couples don't even get around to having sex, we figured we ought to find out what they're doing instead. From passing out due to exhaustion to just passing out drunk, here are seven true tales from brides and grooms of how their big night actually went down. Spent the night in the hospital instead "At our reception, my husband decided to do the worm on the dance floor. About 20 minutes later, my best friend found me and frantically said, 'Do you know your husband is bleeding to death in the kitchen?' I ran into the kitchen area outside the main ballroom and found my husband and my dad's cousin trying to stop the blood spurting from my husband's chin with paper towels. While doing the worm, my husband accidentally slammed his chin into the dance floor before his chest and split his chin open. My husband, who looked very green from all the blood running down his tuxedo, said he needed a drink of water. Because it was close to the end of the reception and the bar was closed, I searched everywhere for a bottle of water. When I finally found one and ran back to the kitchen, my husband was gone. I thought I'd find him in the back of an ambulance, but instead I found him back on the dance floor with a butterfly bandage over his chin being body passed by his friends. After the reception, we headed to the hospital for stitches, which is where we spent the night!" -- Rebecca, 39 Brides: The Most Flattering Wedding Dress for Your Body Type Passed out drunk "I got super drunk at my wedding and passed out on my wedding night. We had planned an after party in our suite so there were 10 to 15 people over partying while I slept. They ordered pizza and I was told people were jumping up and down on my bed trying to wake me. I didn't know any of that happened, and I had the worst hangover the next day. We had to be up at 6 a.m. to take a plane to Maui, Hawaii, for our honeymoon. It was horrendous." -- Damon, 35 Brides: Kim Kardashian's Wedding Dress! 11 Fantasy Sketches Too tired to even talk "I had expected my wedding night to be this crazy time, up all night, the works. We got into a hot bath and I don't think I could carry a conversation. All I could think about was how tired and hungry I felt, so we ordered pizza. While we waited, we watched 'The Wedding Singer' -- and I passed out. Not a light sleep, out cold. My husband had to shake me awake to eat before I passed out again. I did not know I would be so tired. I had to sleep for the better part of three days to recover." -- Leah, 27 Brides: The Most Creative Wedding Cakes of the Year A storybook wedding night "I asked my best man and his parents to help me set up the hotel room. When we entered there were rose petals on the floor leading to the refrigerator and the bed. At the fridge were chocolate covered strawberries. The petals leading to the bed showed that the bed was also decorated with a rose petal heart as well as LED flickering candles, which added to the romantic feel. My wife loved it! She was surprised, because she didn't think I could have had time to do it. She also said it was the most romantic thing anyone had ever done for her." -- Andrew, 27 Brides: Gorgeous Plus Size Wedding Dresses Determined to do the deed "I made it a point to make sure we had sex on our wedding night. Even though we partied until 2 a.m. on our wedding night and we were completely exhausted (and a bit drunk), we still did the deed as newlyweds. The funny thing is, I had this sexy, intricately strappy lingerie outfit I planned on wearing, but I ditched that plan and my husband didn't blame me one bit." -- Jenna, 26 Brides: Expecting (and Engaged!) Celebrities Encountered an unexpected visitor "Let's just say my aunt walked in on us! She thought we were at our own after party and made the hotel staff open the door. We obviously didn't answer and froze to make her go away. Then in she comes with two other people with all of our gifts! We were mortified and started yelling at them to go away. Mood killed. No after-party after that. And nothing else either .... except sleep." -- Lauren, 26 Brides: The Most Beautiful Honeymoon Destinations Tears of alcohol "Leading up to our wedding, my recently married friends kept reminding us to enjoy ourselves, because not only is the night short, but it's also really expensive. So we did; we got wasted. My wife completely forgot about her father-daughter dance. Plus she slept on the bus ride from the venue to the hotel. When we retired for the night she cried because she didn't remember much from the night. It was kinda funny." -- Mark, 31 Did you do the deed on your wedding night?

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/08/living/going-gray-natural-hair/index.html	living	7 mother-inspired reasons to consider having gray hair - CNN.com	2014/05/08	Thursday May 8 09:37:43 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Our mothers and the women we look up to offer our first lessons in beauty and personal maintenance. They tell us whether it's acceptable to leave the house without a painted face, well-coiffed hair or shaved legs. They send those messages both indirectly, through their own beauty rituals, and directly, with a well-placed, "No, you are not going out looking like that!" Ultimately, what we decide to do as adults comes down to individual choice and evolving beauty ideals, but mom's old routines can stick with us as we age, especially when it comes to gray hair. Even as fashion, makeup and hairstyles change, the pressure for women to cover up gray hair endures, no matter how many lists or articles tell us to embrace natural beauty. And yet, there's hope! Take it from these women who chose to stop covering their grays in their 20s and 30s. They have nothing against women who choose to color their hair, but this is what works for them. They shared their most compelling reasons for embracing the look. Let us know in the comments what you would add or dispute! It's a great way to rebel against mom -- and challenge beauty standards Watching her mother fret over finding the right color and hairstylist made Kelly Barrows want to do the exact opposite. She never understood why her mom did not appreciate her thick, beautiful curls, which Barrows herself coveted. "She's so beautiful and all she sees is what she could change," she said. While Barrows, 27, can't influence her mother's attitude toward aging or appearance, she can change her own. Her grays are just starting to come in, but she's looking forward to more, and she has no plans to hide them. "I like showing my mom that I can take pride in it and it's not something to be ashamed of." Christine Candelaria also has vivid memories of how the women in her life were tied to the messy rituals of dying their "canas" every few months at home: stains, chemicals running down their foreheads, accidentally choosing an unflattering shade. "I clearly remember sitting on my mom's bed in eighth grade, watching her hair ritual, and declaring out loud that I would NEVER dye my hair. I remember thinking to myself that I wanted to grow old naturally." Or, you can honor the silver foxes in your life Ty Alexander's mother and father never colored their hair, so she was used to seeing adults own the look with confidence. "For me it was just what our family did. It wasn't a second thought," said 37-year-old Alexander, who stopped coloring her grays when she was 25. "I knew I would stop dying it because that's what we all did." Larissa Pissarra, 42, also took style cues from her mother's natural approach to personal maintenance. Her mother wore minimal makeup and never colored her hair, not even when it started graying. "She looked great no matter what," she said. "When she started graying, she didn't do any color, and she didn't seem to care." It's cheaper than being a "slave" to the stylist Pissarra didn't pay much attention to her grays as they started coming in in her 20s. But when the odd strand turned into streaks, her stylist gave her an ultimatum. "She said, 'You have to decide right now. You either start coloring now, or you never start, because after you start you become a slave to it,'" Pissarra recalls. It was an easy decision for Pissarra, who didn't wear much makeup or do much with her hair to begin with. Her hair was healthy, so why mess with it? "At first it was more of a financial and practical thing. I thought it would be reasonable for me," she said. "Then I started reading about chemicals and stuff and realized I didn't want all that in my head." You can still play around with products and styling Alexander's hair has been through just about every style and color since she began experimenting with her look at age 14. By the time she reached her mid-20s, her hair was getting brittle from all the experimentation. By then, the gray streaks that her parents passed on had become visible. She decided to stop coloring before her hair fell out, but that didn't mean she had to stop experimenting. Alexander tries different shampoos, conditioners and DIY remedies to keep her color from getting dull or brassy. Her go-to method is a mixture of peroxide, water and conditioner to strip product from her hair and keep the color bright. You've earned them!  It's all about perspective, and those who embrace their grays often see them as badges of honor that reflect experience and wisdom accumulated over the years. "Obviously part of it is genetics, but I also feel like it's part of who I am," said 49-year-old Marya McCabe, who stopped coloring her hair in her early 30s. Three years ago, the married mother of two left Microsoft after more than a decade to start her own consulting firm. She thinks her gray hair lends "credibility" to her background, both personally and professionally. "I really see my gray hair as a representation of my experience," she said. "I did something to earn these grays." For Kelly Barrows, her first few grays validated the stress she felt from motherhood. Barrows suffered from postpartum depression after the birth of her first child, though she didn't realize it at first. She was overwhelmed by the new responsibilities and anxious over losing her identity, but struggled to see it as something more than "run-of-the-mill" experiences of any new mother. "To come out of it gray-haired is affirming that the stress is real and that the struggle is real," Barrows said. "I have real visual evidence to show that it's been hard. It wasn't in my head or invented." It makes you stand out Apart from her silver sheen, McCabe considers herself pretty average for a Seattle woman; she skips makeup and wears jeans on most days. "I'm very vanilla in every other way, but my hair makes me unique," McCabe said. "My hair makes me stand out physically and because I've chosen to do something different it has become sort of an identifier for me." When Alexander was preparing to launch a lifestyle blog in 2010, she knew after more than a decade of experience that her hair would be the first thing people noticed. Her blog, "Gorgeous in Gray," celebrates her look while dishing on the latest in style and beauty news and trends. "It's the first thing people see, which is also one of the marketing reasons I chose it," she said. "I use my hair to keep my name in people's mouths." Strangers will compliment you Alexander swears that not a day goes by without someone stopping her in the street to talk about her hair. Usually, it's a compliment followed by questions about her age, her history with hair care and how she maintains it. Larissa Pissarra says she gets more compliments from strangers on her hair with each passing year; some even ask if her silver highlights are the product of a salon. "Women come up to me and say 'You inspire me.' That makes me feel good," she said. "Guys make compliments, too. They don't seem to care as much about our hair as we do. It's more in our heads than it is in theirs." Another reason going gray is one more option to add to your beauty toolbox: You can always change your mind! How do you feel about going gray?

More important than my age and attire, though,are the experiences I've had and what they've taught me about love, friendship, myself, and (not least) being a wedding guest.Here's what I've learned. 1. Weddings are not just about the couple getting married. Make no mistake, the lovely twosome about to wed are who you're there for; this event is the reason you took three days off work and put$800 on your credit card. But no modern wedding would be complete without a group of friends and family there to support, cheer on, andsometimes roast the happy couple. In the wedding ecosystem, what keeps everyone grooving out on thedance floor, clinking glasses with forks and weeping happy tears are the strong interrelationships between the people there. A wedding wouldn't be a wedding without the guests. 2. You can say no to a wedding without saying no to a friendship. I wish someone would have told me this early on in my wedding-going life, I might have saved a bit of cash. There are times when itsimply doesn't make sense to go to a wedding, for your own personal reasons: finances, lack of vacation days, familial obligations,state of mind. But this doesn't necessarily mean the end. A few years ago, some very good friends decided to marry in India. I'd juststarted a new job and couldn't afford the time off or the cost of the trip. So I said no, and, months later, got to attend their legally binding U.S. ceremony at CityHall in Manhattan. As my dad told me when I interviewed him for "Save the Date": "It's the journey, not the destination." That'swhat matters in a friendship, too. It's not the one day, it's all the days. 3. Give the gift you want to give.  This is a controversial statement, but I'm standing by it  with some caveats. If you know themarrying couple well and the gifts on the registry seem impersonal and you have an idea for a present you know they'll love, by all means, do it. "It's the thought that counts" should apply to everyone in receipt of a gift, including people getting married. You canalso include a gift receipt, just in case. 4. No date is better than any date. It can seem tempting (particularly in later years when people are beginning topair up) to grab the nearest available sir or madam and ask them to attend the wedding with you. Consider that movecarefully. Just because someone is able to put on a suit and tie and sit at a table does not mean you want him there for what's bound tobe an emotional moment in a dear friend's life (and possibly yours, too). It's really freeing to go to a wedding by yourself, to knowyou can do it, and not have to take care of a date who may not know anyone else there. It's even better not to go to a wedding with aperson you hardly know, who ends up behaving poorly. 5. Open bars are not your enemy, but open tequila-shot bars might be.  Enjoy the signature cocktails andthe refills of good white wine, but be careful. Know your limitations, even as they seem to grow farther away the more you drink. Drink water between every glass of something stronger, or just make sure to drink water. And if there's a tequilabar set on the cliffs at a destination wedding in Jamaica, limit yourself to one shot, lest things get too murky. 6. Eat.  One of the most obvious things a person should do is eat the food provided. After all, the couple has gone to thetrouble of choosing it. But weddings can be full of so many things to see and people to talk to and all of a suddenthey're playing "All the Single Ladies" and you just want to get up and dance and where's that cute guy again, the one who was makinggoo-goo eyes at you from table 13? Only later, you may realize that you don't feel so well, what with the signature cocktails and the factthat all you ingested was a couple bites of the salad they served before the main course. And you end up back in thehotel room, eating Cheetos or a granola bar or an old, bruised apple from the bottom of your duffel bag, making goo-goo eyes at no onebut yourself. So eat. 7. Don't flirt with the staff.  This can seem tempting. They are so nice! They are serving you, giving you whatever you need, beforeyou even know you need it! Note: They are paid to do this. This does not mean they want to be your friend, nor your new boy-orgirlfriend. They are doing a job. So treat them professionally and kindly, and go flirt with someone else. 8. Do flirt with other (single!) people.  This is part of the fun of a wedding! But make sure they are single, because sometimes,even at weddings, people don't tell you this right off the bat (trust me, I know). Also make sure that they are not a relative of the bride orgroom or a person with whom it would be very awkward or potentially disastrous for you to flirt ... the bride's dad, for instance. If the brideor groom has highly recommended a particular person to you as a hook-up, you are free to go for that person or ignore him or hercompletely in favor of another. You don't have to do everything they say, just because it's their wedding day. 9. Your feelings are legitimate, whatever they may be.  Depending on where you are in your life, you may not be attending the event with the most positive, rose-colored-glasses vibe. You might feel downright crappy aboutlove, relationships or what you see as a lack of success. If you feel that way, acknowledge it and hang out withit for however long you need. Go to yoga, get a massage, buy a great new dress, go on a 5-mile run, watch a "Law & Order" marathon,or whatever it is that you do to treat yourself before you go to this event. But once you're there, try your best to be in the moment. You may find that when it's all over, you'll go home feeling a lot better. And if you don't, you can wake up the next dayand try again. 10. Honesty really is the best policy  including to yourself.  Above all, be real. Let yourself feel what youfeel. If you have something to tell the bride or groom before they get married, do it, with kindness and honesty. But do it weeks or months before theceremony or reception  not minutes! Also be honest about what this day means, how you would like to celebratethe people you are there for and how you would like to celebrate it for yourself. If you mess up, to yourself, to anyone, apologize. 11. There is no such thing as a perfect day.  Something will go wrong; these meticulously arranged parties with numerous guestsare chock-full of opportunities for just about anything to go a little bit awry. But the only thing that can really go wrong is letting whatevergoes wrong ruin the day  and this goes for the marrying couple as well as the guests. Take what happens in stride. This is only oneday; the couple have the rest of their life together, and you have the rest of your friendship life with them, too. Plus, often the things thathappen that no one planned for are the things that make a wedding most memorable, and the things you'll all still be laughing about 20years from now.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/living/white-people-diversity-identity/index.html	living	The uncomfortable role white parents play in diversity - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 08:13:16 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Susan Bodnar is a clinical psychologist who teaches at Columbia University's Teachers College and at the Stephen Mitchell Center for Relational Studies. She lives in Manhattan with her husband, two children and all of their pets. (CNN) -- In my family, I'm always bringing up stories from the past, our family's story, our diversity. My daughter often rolls her eyes. "We don't need to keep talking about this stuff. We get it." My son admonishes. "We know!" In truth, their schools have done of a good job trying to make their population more closely resemble our country and our world. My kids have friends of all races, cultures and social classes. However, as a female white mom married to a male white dad with two biologically conceived white children, I'm trying to make a different point. I want them to understand that light skin color is not the norm from which everyone differs. White is not the signifier of normal. Many white kids take diversity for granted. They have worked hard to overcome stereotypes and bias and to accept other people as different. The fact that they may be someone else's diversity rarely occurs to them, let alone most white adults. Three influences have altered my white-centric perspective: my psychology students, the people with whom I work in my clinical practice and the diversity work of both my kids' New York City private schools. Some of my psychology students wanted to write a children's book where every character had a different identity. Children's books generally feature characters of one race or ethnicity, not multiple identities in interaction with one another. When we finished our first draft, we realized our characters had become very close friends. They each came from a different place but everyone had came from somewhere. Skin color doesn't define personhood, but since race is a marker of identity in our society, the experience of personhood includes having to deal with the meanings others attribute to racial identity. Protected by the privacy of a clinical relationship, beautiful black and brown women have shared how ugly they feel. Gentle dark-skinned men convey the humiliation that overcomes them when white people mistake them for dangerous criminals. Since whiteness has become synonymous with a better life, it is easy for any lighter-skinned person to use skin color as a shield against hurtful stereotypes about social class, gender, sexuality, family history or even mental illness. When white people deny their own embarrassing identity markers, we perpetuate the hypocrisy that only people of color have these problems. As a psychologist -- no, as a person -- recognizing status and identity anxiety as a mutual experience lifts the veil that ordinarily separates us from each other. This year, the parents association at one of my kids' schools named me co-chair of the diversity committee. I felt so self-conscious. Group leadership called forth a greater reckoning with my identity than simply participating in a committee. It also provided me the chance to experience being a minority member of a group. Sometimes I sat as the only white person at the table feeling really insecure, worried that I would be seen as a white stereotype instead of as myself. How did growing up white with financial struggles intersect with racial diversity? When white people want to "help" people of color, it always reeks of privilege and entitlement as in, "let me help you with your problems." It's a different sentiment than "let's help each other with our problems." Did people of color trust me? Did they wonder what I was doing on the diversity committee? Was it my job to speak for the concerns of underrepresented minorities? Or did I contribute more by trying to put forth a more multifaceted approach to the question of identity? How can we sit with each other's differences without feeling compelled to rank one way of being or looking as being better or worse than the other? Our diversity committee ultimately worked through these questions in our conversations. Although we did not fully answer them, we found that by talking about them, we discovered the theme of our work and developed a friendship. I now look at diversity as something that is in my interest: I want to live in a society where dignified difference constitutes our common core. Nuances in how we think, feel, work and love define what it means to be human. Everyone is unusual and unique. Racism is just another word for hating our realness. Our commonality as a country derives from the fact that we all have an identity just beneath the surface of our skins. The variety of stories that inhabit the people who call this country home -- from the brutality of slavery to the flight from genocides to the call to some better god -- enable democracy's creative synergy. The hands that have built the instruments of modern America have been every color, every nationality and every religion. I want to be part of a world that loves and embraces humanity as a diverse and interconnected organism. I want to be part of a world that accepts that every difference has a color, and every color has a unique meaning. How do I do this? I realized that it starts at home. Rather than teaching my kids that they are white, I want to impart to them that they are part of a kaleidoscope -- lots of continually shifting colors and shapes. They don't always want to hear their parents tell another story about grandpa's poverty or the coal-mining relatives. But this history holds our family's painful and joyous truths. Every family need only peel back the layers of a few generations to find their own story. Authentic family history exposes everyone's diversity. A society that embraces uniqueness loves the messiness of the human condition. Being loved despite or because of our messy truths creates empathy rather than sympathy. When we raise children to accept and acknowledge their own story, they learn to listen to someone else's, with respect. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Susan Bodnar. 
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/23/living/marry-terminally-ill-person-matrimony/index.html	living	Terminally ill partners can still marry - CNN.com	2014/05/23	Friday May 23 08:47:51 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- As wedding season gears up this month, the words "in sickness and in health" and "till death do us part" will lie at the heart of many vows. For couples who are facing a terminal illness, these promises are a bittersweet reminder of the limits of time; gratitude for the days and months they have, ache for those they might not. On June 1, residents of Illinois will witness their state's first day of marriage equality, but for Pat Ewert, 66, the day's expressions of love will be tempered by a slight pang as she watches many of her friends lawfully unite. "I don't have that person to celebrate with. It's painful, but I'm so happy for all my friends," Ewert says. On November 27, 2013, Ewert and Vernita Gray, her partner of five years and one of Chicago's most steadfast gay rights activists, were granted an expedited marriage license by a federal judge. It was the state's first legally recognized same-sex marriage, and there was a purpose to the haste: Gray's breast cancer had metastasized in her sternum and eventually, her brain. "These two women, who have loved and cared for each other in good times and bad, through sickness and through health, will get to know what it means to be married," Camilla Taylor, Marriage Project director for Lambda Legal, an LGBT rights organization, said in a statement shortly after the decision. For Ewert and Gray, marriage is and was the ultimate display of commitment. "It was weird for me to start using 'wife,'" Ewert says. "There is a real difference." Gray passed away on March 19, 2014, at the age of 65 -- just shy of the couple's four-month wedding anniversary. Ewert says the marriage ceremony was a moment of pure, unbridled joy that had been a long time coming (the couple had been engaged since Christmas 2009), but that they had always been "just a couple of little old ladies who live in a condo in Chicago" with the wish that "at some point, people will get that we're just another couple." "[She's] the first thing that I think about when I wake up, and the last thing at night," Ewert says of her late wife. When a boyfriend dies, does the grief mean less? Caring for both parties Diana Denholm, a psychotherapist, wrote the book "The Caregiving Wife's Handbook," after her personal life and professional expertise overlapped. Her own husband, John Sammond, was diagnosed with colon cancer, then congestive heart failure. Her husband received his diagnosis in 1994, one month into their engagement, along with the information that he was facing a 20% survival rate. "It's a big decision, and it's not an easy decision. I know after my husband got his diagnosis, he let me out of saying 'yes,'" Denholm says. But she walked down the aisle, and took care of Sammond until the time of his death 11 years later on January 31, 2006. Since then, she's devoted her professional career to helping people understand the realities of the day-to-day while partners navigate terminal illness. It might include issues of intimacy, household management or most importantly, the well partner's own self-care. Denholm says it's primarily important to manage expectations of how hands-on the healthy spouse will be in the caretaking, for instance, if they will quit their job and focus on caretaking full-time. "I can't stress that enough, and if you don't, then you're in it," Denholm says. There's also guilt and denial: Guilt of being vilified if the relationship doesn't work out while one partner remains sick, and the guilt of "why them, not me," if it does. Ewert readily admits she was in denial until Gray's final moments. Gray had survived breast cancer before, and Ewert was sure she could again. "I told her she owed me another 19 years. You owe me more," Ewert recalls telling Gray, despite Gray admitting this time was different. "Some of that [denial] is good. If we went into everything with a horrible outlook, that wouldn't be helpful," psychotherapist Denholm says. Beyond that, Denholm explains, it's important to understand the concept of enabling; the healthy spouse often feels the need to do every single task, turning the sick person into an invalid. If it's something the afflicted person can manage, let them do it. It's about collaboration, not animosity. When the relationship becomes more like that of a parent and child, intimacy is lost, she says. Denholm stresses that physical affection and connection may no longer be expressed as "intercourse" in the sense most people understand it; it could just mean lying next to the person, gently holding their hand or massaging them. "Intimacy can remain until the very end, and in some ways the intimacy can strengthen," she says. Even though that's helpful for the couple on their journey, someone is eventually left behind to go it alone. "No matter how prepared you are for when they die, it's always painful when they die," Denholm says. 'Hanging on a moment' Jeff Lang just celebrated what would have been his wife's 36th birthday at her favorite gelato shop. For him, the wound is still raw. "A lot of people say, 'You'll get over it.' I don't want to. I want to get on with it, but with this being a huge part of what has shaped my life and love now, I will always honor that," Lang said in an e-mail this week. Lang married Jen Bulik-Lang in July 2013. She was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in December 2012, but had recently been told that even after five months of treatments, continuing treatment would not help her prognosis. The couple decided it was now or never. Their wedding captivated the national media after an event planner, Erica Becks, got local vendors to step up and create their dream ceremony -- all the way down to a New Orleans' style Second Line. The couple's first dance was to an acoustic version of Lady Gaga's "Edge of Glory." "That line -- 'hanging on a moment with you' -- that's what we're doing right now. We really don't know what's next. Even though we got this bad news, we're not letting that defeat us, we're still on that edge of glory," Lang told CNN in August right after their wedding. "I'm choosing to live and be part of his life for how long forever is," Bulik-Lang said at the time. Bulik-Lang passed away in their Mountain View, California, home three months later on October 12, 2013. "Jen said to me once, 'I'm not afraid, I'm just sad' and we lived it that way," Lang says now, seven months after her passing. "We knew we would miss it if it was gone, so we made the most of every minute." Lang says that not having a future dictated their outlook on life, and it is how he continues to live. "I don't see accomplishments and money as the prime drivers of my day-to-day life. I love, and I have relationships that are deep and meaningful, I go out of my way to make that happen," he says. Funny obits bring new life to a dying art A wedding wish Wedding planner Liz Guthrie always cherished the "special day," but she didn't quite know how special it could be to couples facing serious health problems until she began organizing a dream wedding giveaway in 2009 to couples who had endured some sort of hardship. More than 400 applicants applied, and Guthrie noticed many had a common theme: Limited time together. From there, she founded Wish Upon A Wedding, a nonprofit devoted to providing weddings and vow renewals to couples who are facing terminal illness. The organization is now working on its 65th wedding wish. "The ceremony itself is so important to so many people," Guthrie says. Tina and Lance Martin of St. Louis were granted their ceremony by the organization on June 27, 2011. When the couple first met, Tina was undergoing chemotherapy for stage 4 non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Tina's chemotherapy treatments ended in February 2009, and she is now five years in remission. Shortly before their engagement in March 2011, Lance was himself diagnosed with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, a kidney disease that results in renal failure if not treated regularly with dialysis or, more permanently, a transplant. Medical details and prognosis limits did not define their wedding day. Their moments -- however many they had left -- were at the core of the celebration. Now, three years later, their story is still being written. "Getting married to the love of my life is the greatest blessing," Tina says. "It was nice not to have to think about medical and health problems during this time, and we were able to focus on something bigger and better-- our marriage." "Every day is a struggle, but we have one goal in mind," she says. "Happily ever after." Have you faced a terminal illness in your relationship?

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/22/living/dont-wash-jeans-levis-ceo/index.html	living	Don't machine wash your jeans, says Levi's CEO - CNN.com	2014/05/22	Thursday May 22 10:07:38 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Levi Strauss CEO Chip Bergh has some unusual style advice for 501 fans: Step away from the washing machine. The denim honcho shared the words of wisdom this week at Fortune's Brainstorm Green conference in Laguna Niguel, California. "These jeans are maybe a year old and these have yet to see a washing machine," he said of the pair he wore during a chat onstage. "I know that sounds totally disgusting." He recommended spot cleaning jeans with a sponge or toothbrush and a bit of detergent, then air drying. He says you should very seldom machine wash. "If you treat them right, they'll last a long, long time -- probably longer than most people's waistline." He added that less washing equals greater environmental sustainability. READ: Do you care where your clothes come from? It's not new advice. Designer Tommy Hilfiger has made similar comments. And CNN's Anderson Cooper told style expert Stacy London two years ago that he washes his jeans very rarely. Jeans aficionados may be accustomed to hearing some unusual tips on keeping their denim products fresh. Advice ranges from spot cleaning jeans and never washing them to freezing them to kill any germs. Jolie Kerr, who writes a column called "Ask a Clean Person," says it depends on your lifestyle and hygiene preferences. "Consider how you're wearing your jeans and make laundering decisions accordingly," said Kerr, who recently released the book "My Boyfriend Barfed in My Handbag ... and Other Things You Can't Ask Martha." "The way you'd care for a pair of jeans that you wear for yardwork versus ones you'd wear out dancing should be different -- the function should dictate how you treat a pair of jeans." Opinion: The great jean debate - freeze 'em or wash 'em?

This year, some universities are drawing on famous alumni: The University of New Hampshire featured 1992 New Hampshire graduate Jennifer Lee, the Oscar-winning screenwriter and director of Disney's hit film "Frozen." Others competed for high-profile speakers like President Barack Obama, who will speak at University of California-Irvine, and first lady Michelle Obama, who spoke at Dillard University in New Orleans, as well as a high school senior recognition ceremony in Topeka, Kansas, and a college access program in Washington. Regardless of the school, expect some tough talk, quotable wisdom and a few zingers. "Nobody cares how tough your upbringing was," President Obama told graduates of Morehouse College in Atlanta in 2013. "Nobody cares if you suffered some discrimination. And moreover, you have to remember that whatever you've gone through, it pales in comparison to the hardships previous generations endured -- and they overcame them. And if they overcame them, you can overcome them, too," The gallery above shows some high-profile commencement speakers that grads will hear from this spring. Who was your graduation speaker?

http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/31/living/spelling-bee-experience/index.html	living	The agony and ecstasy of the National Spelling Bee - CNN.com	2012/05/31	Thursday May 31 02:38:42 EDT 2012	(CNN) -- In 2001, I walked into the editorial pit of the men's magazine where I was working as an art director and saw the almost all-dude staff glued to ESPN coverage. As I glimpsed the TV screen, a shock of panic and nausea wracked my body, and I bolted from the room. A friend followed to find me huddled in a ball at my desk. "I was ... there," I admitted. "In the Bee. I lost." He grabbed my shoulders and shoved me back in front of my colleagues, still staring rapt at the rows of fresh-faced kids, competing their hearts out at the National Spelling Bee. "DUDE! Kat was THERE!" They swarmed around and pressed me for details: the words, the kids, the prizes, meeting the president, the "crying room," the pressure. It began to dawn on me that they didn't give two sloppy syllables that I hadn't won -- just that I'd been there, and that was incontrovertibly cool. But it didn't feel cool at the time, and here I am again, in the middle of my annual freakout. Karla Miller is right there with me. The two of us met as competitors in the 1986 National Spelling Bee, where I wilted in the third round on "phyllophorous" and she slogged through until nearly the end, eventually biting it on "dentifrice." We re-struck a friendship at this time last year, mostly because we both still shared the solid core of warmth and weirdness that drew us together 25 years before but also because it helps to have someone around who's endured a similar trauma. Being a Bee kid is rough stuff, and it sticks with you. Miller, now an associate director of editorial communications at KPMG and author of the Washington Post Magazine's @Work Advice column, can't stomach the media coverage. "I get this sickly twist in my gut when I see it on TV," she said. "I haven't seen 'Spellbound' (a documentary about the Bee), although everyone tells me I should. I know it sounds like I'm being dramatic, but I think watching it requires a level of detachment that's hard to achieve when you've been there." READ: National Spelling Bee fast facts Katie Lambert agrees. The Atlanta-based editor still feels the sting of her 1998 Bee loss. She declines to disclose the word that felled her, and though she realizes that being a Bee veteran holds some geek cachet, she mostly just wants to put it all behind her. "That fear of getting onstage and choking completely still haunts me," she said. "For a time, I was a Middle Eastern dancer, and I think that lingering fear held me back from ever doing my best. I would get onstage, see the lights and the people, and flash back. To this day, when I see coverage of the Bee, I feel a little sick. That loss still hurts, and the humiliation is still there." And with annual Bee hysteria at a fever pitch, it's inescapable these days. Miller, Lambert and I took the stage in the era before the @scrippsbee Twitter feed blasted a blow-by-blow account of the early rounds, spectator seats went for $20 to $40 a pop and the ESPN broadcast became appointment viewing for people not directly related to the wee, trembling geeks onstage. The gut-gnarling stress of attempting to piece together words plucked from a seemingly alien tongue (spellers faced "leucoryx" "barukhzy" and "hoomalimali" just Wednesday) is more than most reasonable adults could bear. Having to do so onstage, at the apex of one's awkward phase, in front of a battery of news cameras and reporters feels like a twisted sociological experiment -- and it leaves a scar. In 2012, 6-year-old Lori Anne Madison, the youngest speller on record with the Scripps National Spelling Bee, told the Washington Post that she didn't feel undue pressure during Bee competition. Perhaps she overcame her awkward phase in utero and will be spared such indignity in her inevitable future appearances on the Bee stage. Lucky her. My job often requires speaking unscripted on live television at a moment's notice or addressing crowds of a hundred people who've forked over cash in part to hear me yammer. That's a skip through a sun-dappled meadow compared with my brief, ignominious Bee foray. While I wasn't especially bent on winning for my own sake, I was keenly aware that my family, school, hometown and the local sponsoring newspaper had invested an awful lot of time, cash and care into my trip to Washington, and I did not want to fail them. I did fail, and for that, I was deeply ashamed. READ: National contest isn't bee-all and end-all In 1998, Justin Warner (fatal word: "tarpaulin") empathized as his fellow competitors folded. "Watching kids put so much emotion in to what is essentially a game really affected my personal growth," said the proprietor of Brooklyn, New York's much-lauded Do or Dine restaurant and a current contestant on "The Next Food Network Star." "There were plenty of kids that were there to have a good time and rock out some serious spelling, but there were also plenty that seemed like they were going to be eliminated from society as opposed to a game. Hanging out in the 'Kiss and Cry' room after being eliminated was so sad to me, not because I was eliminated early but because there were so many crying kids!" That fabled place, officially labeled the "Comfort Room," is no longer a cookie-and-lemonade-laden refuge for tearstained spellers. Not because the need was lessened and the current crop of competitors are automatons; rather, Scripps spokeswoman (and Bee vet) Kara Hadge says, "We just ran out of room." After the dreaded bell tolls, the child -- weeping, shocked, relieved or simply numb -- is escorted from the stage and handed off to a parent, who has probably been absorbing the shock of every syllable. "Whatever I was suffering onstage, my family -- Mom in particular -- went through it a hundredfold in their seats," Miller said. "But they helped give me perspective. When I left the stage, I was never made to feel that I had blown it. It was just, 'Hey, tough break; we're proud of you; ready for some ice cream?' " Warner used the trip to the nation's capital to indulge in his first fine dining experience, exposure to an industry that would become his life's work. "When I went to the national level, I knew I'd be up against kids who believed that this was their only shot towards excellence, fame and fortune," he said. "I was more excited about getting a meal at Michel Richard's Citronelle. I had squab for the first time." READ: Sweet 'spell' of success No one at the Bee is there by accident. While this might be someone's first outing in the orthographic Super Bowl, it takes many rounds -- from school bees to local to regional -- to qualify for the National Spelling Bee. Even Warner, who says he didn't put much effort into his studies, went through practice sessions with his father -- and later realized he'd made the exact flub that sealed his fate at the Bee. Other spellers -- weaned on academic combat like Olympics of the Mind, speech competitions and Mathletics -- arrived in D.C., eschewed all social activities and hunkered down in their rooms for a final training sprint. For most, that was for naught, but for Stephanie Petit, winner of the 1987 Bee, it paid off with the correct spelling of "staphylococci." The San Francisco-based attorney admits, "I opted out of most of the fun activities. I am of two minds about this. Some part of me definitely wishes I had taken the time to acquaint myself better with the other spellers. But of course, a part of me says it's a good thing I did as I did, since perhaps that's what worked." Despite Petit's victory, some residual emotion comes to the fore during Bee season. "It brings me back, and I get a little bit nervous again, as when I was in the competition. Maybe that's why I don't follow the actual competition in progress so much. I always read about the results, the winning word, the finalists, the composition of the contestants, and all of that always makes me happy." She also credits her Bee stint with aiding in her professional development, giving her nerves steady enough to endure high-pressure situations. Jon Pennington, who rocketed past both Miller and me to become the 1986 victor on the word "odontalgia," came to the Bee possessed of a tremendous passion for spelling and spelling bees -- as well as a lower-than-average fear of public speaking -- and his mother's sunglasses. The bright lights of the cameras bothered his eyes, and a friend back home mistook his victory picture for one of Corazon Aquino, who was in the news for having just overthrown the Philippine government of Ferdinand Marcos. Pennington says he caught a private plane to New York to appear on "Good Morning America" and then returned to Washington to meet President Reagan in the White House Rose Garden. He weathered the exposure well. "My main emotional reaction is pride," he said. "The kids competing in the Spelling Bee today are competing at such a higher level than what I remember from 25 years ago. If anything, I'm glad that there's been a change in our culture, where people are willing to accept the label of 'nerdy' and 'dorky,' because of their pride in their intellectual interests and accomplishments." Pennington, who recently completed an MBA program at the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota, still watches the Bee. Although he admits he no longer has the accuracy rate he used to, he says he still spells a few words right in the later rounds sometimes and thinks to himself, "I still got it." As for me, for years, I was able to avoid the very existence of the Bee. That is, until that fateful day in 2001, when I walked into a Bee-induced panic attack. I still can't get anywhere near the coverage without danger of near-retroperistalsis, but I have (mostly) forgiven myself for the loss. I came, I dorked, I fumbled, I failed, but at least I was there. And as Miller says, "Fate either smiles or blows you a raspberry. No matter how embarrassing the loss, almost no one will remember it in a year's time. And I learned that the fuller your life is, the less the individual stumbles bother you." Were you a bee kid?

But rather than harbor ill will, what if you could flip those relationships from bad to better? It's possible, and we're here to tell you how. Glamour.com: 10 Wardrobe Essentials Every Woman Should Own Enemy #1: Your boss Whether she shames you in group meetings or denies your vacation requests, you've got a nagging feeling your superior finds you inferior. The first step toward friendship, experts say, is to suppress your impulse to smack-talk. "You've probably been venting to whomever will listen to you about this boss for so long that you don't realize how much of your life you expend on negativity," says April Masini, relationship expert and author of "Think & Date Like a Man." Instead, "start doing nice things, as if there's a Secret Santa competition happening and you've pulled your boss' name from the hat. Bring coffee, offer to read over something for her, stay late at work or ask her if she'd like to have lunch." Glamour.com: Kate Middleton's New Zealand and Australia Tour Outfits Enemy #2: Your mother-in-law She may have raised the man of your dreams, but you seriously wonder how they could possibly share the same DNA. If you have to endure yet another hellish flight to the middle of nowhere to spend the holidays eating her terrible food, you'll scream. Your move: Start new family traditions -- but include her in them. "For example, if Thanksgiving has always been held at her home and you'd like to host this year, talk to your husband first and your mother-in-law second," says Masini. Getting him on the same page as you beforehand is essential. Next, "Tell her what you're considering and ask her to think about it for a week or two," says Masni. Chances are, if you're up front about the request, you include her in the plans, you give her time to think and she sees that your husband is on your team, she'll come around. Glamour.com: 10 Beauty Tricks That Make Guys Melt Enemy #3: Your ex Even though you've split, he's still around. He shares your friends, the neighborhood bar or even the same apartment. If you find yourself tense and testy around him (or on the receiving end of such treatment) take a deep breath and try this instead: "Compliment him when you can, without sending the wrong message," Masini says. "You can tell him that you really liked a particular thing about him -- the way he was so good with your friends' kids, or the respectful way he treated his parents. He may have a preconceived template for treating an ex [bashing you = distancing himself from you], but if you don't play along and show him a better way, you may just win him over." Glamour.com: 50 Wedding Dresses That Will Make Your Heart Skip a Beat Enemy #4: Your boyfriend's ex (you know, the one who just won't go away) "In a perfect world, your current flame's ex would move to Alaska," says psychologist Lauren Napolitano. Amen to that! But, alas, we don't live in a perfect world. And she doesn't live in Alaska. The key to a friendly relationship with her is an open conversation with him. "If he has a balanced and appropriately detached relationship with her, you'll likely feel warmly toward her," says Napolitano. In that case, it's good to be friendly when you see her in a group setting. "If, on the other hand, your flame struggles with flirting with her, you may grow hostile toward her," Napolitano says. In this case, you're right to have some comments about the situation (but not right to be hostile!) Openly -- and calmly -- discuss any concerns you have, and establish expected boundaries right at the beginning of your relationship. He'll either assuage your concerns, or continue his flirtatious behavior. Either way, you'll have your answer. Glamour.com: 25 Celebrity Hairstyles That Will Make You Want Bangs Enemy #5: Your (un-neighborly) neighbor You wouldn't borrow sugar from this guy if he had the last stash on earth. Maybe he's the guy who plays loud music 24/7, or maybe he's the guy who bangs on the wall even when your TV volume is barely audible even to you. Either way, explains Napolitano, "When someone criticizes your gardening, your noise level or even your mailbox, you become annoyed with this person. Some neighbors just can't help but express their opinions about everything, and these are the neighbors for which the adage 'good fences make good neighbors' was born." What to do: Acknowledge your differences -- then force yourself to offer appreciation for something he does, even if it's not how you'd do it. "For example, if you disagree on how tidy to keep a front lawn, tell your neighbor that you really appreciate how tidy he keeps things, and that when your work load lets up, you'll have more time to emulate his style," says Masini.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/23/living/100-deadliest-days-for-teen-drivers-parents/index.html	living	Memorial Day starts the 100 deadliest days for teen drivers - CNN.com	2014/05/23	Friday May 23 04:57:27 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. She is a mom of two. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter. (CNN) -- Here's a sobering statistic for the unofficial start of summer, when we gear up for picnics, barbecues and our kids having more free time on their hands: Memorial Day kicks off what's known as 100 deadliest days for teen drivers. From Memorial Day through Labor Day in 2012, nearly 1,000 people were killed in crashes involving teen drivers, and more than 550 of those killed were teens, according to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data analyzed by the nonprofit National Safety Council. Some of the reasons for the spike make sense. Teens are driving more during the summer and it might be more recreational than purposeful, the National Safety Council reports. For instance, instead of driving back and forth to school, they might be driving to the beach, lake or river, and heading down roads they haven't driven before. But one of the biggest reasons for the summer risk increase is that teens might be driving more frequently with more of their friends. "We have always known that passengers were a big risk for teens, but what we're really finding out now is passengers may be one of the most important risks for teens, even more so than things like texting," said John Ulczycki, the National Safety Council's vice president of strategic initiatives. READ: Steering teen drivers out of harm's way  Think about it this way, Ulczycki said: Passengers are a distraction the entire time a teen is driving, whereas the distraction from texting is probably limited to the seconds or minutes they're looking at screens instead of the road. Passengers increase the risk of a teen driver having a fatal crash by at least 44%, according to the National Safety Council. "It's tragic that parents don't really appreciate the risks of passengers," said Ulczycki, who said parents may understand the risks of texting or cell phone use, but aren't as aware of the dangers of a new driver hitting the road with friends in the car. A majority of states have laws on the books regarding the number of passengers allowed for new drivers. Some states don't allow any for the first six months or year after getting a license; some allow one passenger. ''If you have a kid who had their license for less than one year, you have to think very, very carefully about the conditions or the situations in which you allow them to carry any passengers. You really do," Ulczycki said. CNN iReport: Parents of teens share driving tips  Ulczycki, a father of six in Wilmette, Illinois, didn't allow his children to drive with passengers for the first year of their official driving lives. "It was a real bone of contention," he said. "They weren't happy about it, but they all survived." A recent study found that loud conversations and horseplay between passengers were more likely than technology to result in a dangerous incident involving teen drivers. The study by the University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center tracked 52 high-school age drivers in North Carolina who agreed to have cameras installed in their cars. The study appeared in the Journal of Adolescent Health this spring. When there was loud conversation in the car, teen drivers were six times more likely to need to take actions like making an evasive maneuver to avoid a crash. When there was horseplay in the vehicle, they were three times more likely to get into a similarly serious episode, according to the study. "Forty-three states currently restrict newly licensed drivers from having more than one young passenger in their vehicle," Robert Foss, senior research scientist at the Highway Safety Research Center, and director of the Center for the Study of Young Drivers, said in a news release. "The results of this study illustrate the importance of such restrictions, which increase the safety of drivers, their passengers and others on the road by reducing the potential chaos that novice drivers experience." READ: What sways teens not to drink, drive? Stories, not stats Earlier this year, we traveled to Roxbury, New Jersey, to talk with Barb Dunn, her husband and her 16-year-old son Daniel about how they were trying to teach Daniel about safety as he learns to drive. Daniel will get his license on June 3. When I recently got back in touch with Dunn about the dangers of the summer months, her anxiety went up. "My first reaction is fear. Then sadness," Dunn said via e-mail. "I just heard a similar statistic about prom night being a very dangerous time. ... I think we have to take the time to to talk to our children and remind them of the risks and talk about how to minimize them." Ulczycki of the National Safety Council said the best advice for parents is to understand the risks about passengers and drive with them so they can get accustomed to having people in the car. He also suggest parents consider the risks of driving at night. "It's not the time of night. It's how dark it is. That's really the risk here, and I think too many parents think of night driving as a social curfew. 'Well, I'll let my kid stay out until 11 p.m. so he's fine,' " Ulczycki said. "It has nothing to do with that. It has to do with the risk of driving after dark." READ: Zero tolerance makes zero sense: Teen punished for helping drunk friend Annette DiCola Lanteri, a mom of two in Bayport, Long Island, has two girls who are still a few years away from driving age. The best thing parents can do, she said on Facebook, is to teach teen drivers the best we can. "Give them the most knowledge we can so that they can adequately protect themselves, then pray," DiCola Lanteri said. "There are so many variables and we only have so much control." What do you think is the best way to keep teen drivers safe this summer? Share your thoughts in the comments or tell Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook.

She is the host of CNN International's new business show, The Business View, which airs weekdays at 12pm CET. Follow her on Twitter and tell us, using the hashtag #cnnbusinessview, what did your mother teach you? (CNN) -- Perched on a sofa in her West London apartment, Eve Branson recounts early memories of her son Richard. Disciplining him, it seems, was delicate business. "He was like a ball of fire as a little boy," the 90-year-old told me. "Like a thoroughbred. You didn't want to pull the reins too hard and spoil him, spoil his adventures and his madness but you had to pull a little bit." His single-mindedness began to reveal itself when he was just three or four, she recalls. Branson ran off and hid at a local farmer's house after a strong reprimand. "Eventually someone rang to say 'We've got a little blue-eyed boy here? Does he belong to you?' Gosh was I relieved." Now, her son has a knighthood, is worth more than $5 billion according to Forbes and is one of the world's most able -- if eccentric -- entrepreneurs. But what was the secret to such success? Does tough love breed success or is support and encouragement key to raising tomorrow's tycoons? I set out to answer these questions in a series of interviews with the mothers of sports stars, tech pioneers and rockers and discovered they had many traits in common. Branson, it seems, was not the only budding businessman with a mind of his own. Maye Musk, mum of PayPal magnate Elon, has a similar story. The South African model and nutritionist laughs nervously as she recalls the time she left a young Elon Musk behind at home for misbehaving while taking her other children to visit their cousins. It was a 20 minute drive away or four hours on foot, she says. Just as she was leaving Musk says her son turned up out of nowhere. "I saw this tiny little boy, just past toddler stage, coming down the sidewalk. It was Elon. He'd walked there! I was horrified." Now aged 42, her son has revolutionized the world of e-commerce and electric vehicles through his companies Paypal and Tesla. And just like Branson, who soon aims to make passenger space travel a possibility, Musk is taking on the final frontier: with a contract from NASA for his firm Space X to transport orbital cargo. Maye says her each launch leaves her "anxious and shaking and sick," with relief finally coming with success. It's a reaction Judy Murray can sympathize with. Murray has raised two successful children, both of whom hold Wimbledon titles. Older son Jamie is a doubles champion while her youngest is the singles title holder Andy. When Andy Murray clinched the Wimbledon title last year, the first Briton to do so in 77 years, his mother couldn't look. "I buried my face because I knew the cameras would be on me." Murray, herself an accomplished tennis player and coach, introduced her sons to the sport as a way of keeping them busy, but never expected her family name to make the sport's hall of fame. "As eight and nine year olds they were exceptionally good tennis players...but when I saw Andy holding the trophy, I just thought "I can't believe it," she says. Judy Murray has been accused of being pushy but says people "make assumptions because they don't know me. "I've heard Andy and Jamie being asked that before and they say 'my mum never pushed us.' That's why they are still doing what they are doing, because they love what they are doing." Another famous son inspired by his parent's passion is Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. The child of two computer programmers and maths aficionados, Berners-Lee grew up in a household of calculus before bedtime. His 90-year-old mother Mary-Lee shows me a sketch drawn by a family friend on holiday one year depicting a young Tim and three siblings in animated conversation; the word "Noise" scribbled above their heads. "I used to think my children were terribly well behaved but when I look back at this I realize it wasn't always so," she says. She recalls evenings around the dinner table, when the family would try and solve maths problems. If his parents were unable to crack it, Tim Berners-Lee would step in, she told me. "It was all terribly good fun." But good mothers don't always choose the conventional path: Jo Wood, who raised her three kids while on tour with the Rolling Stones, felt it important to educate them on life as a rocker's offspring. Describing the moment she offered her son and daughter cocaine and cannabis, respectively, Jo says she felt "like a lioness showing her cubs the world and what was out there." Did that make her a bad mother? "Luckily it didn't backfire," she says. Now a grandmother, Wood has fond memories of the days she spent on the road with her family and the Stones. "I used to love it. We'd just pack up and it was like we were all going on an adventure." And in many ways Wood was a mother figure to the whole band. "I loved Charlie for his wonderful cold sense of humor, and of course I loved Ronnie, Keith has a special place in my heart and Mick, you never know where you stand with him. One minute he can be fabulous and then next he'll ignore you." Wood credits her kids, art dealer Jaimie, singer Leah and youngest son Tyrone, with helping her through the breakdown of her marriage. She is now runs her own beauty brand and says "my kids kept me sane through all of my hard times," she says. "They'd call me up and make sure I wasn't alone. They'd take me clubbing. And just like the other famous mothers I met she concludes: "My kids are great. I know I wouldn't be the same without them." More from Nina dos Santos: The European Union needs a new vision

Follow her on Twitter @antillaview. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.  (CNN) -- Two high school students -- managing editors at their school newspaper in Ann Arbor, Michigan -- wrote a distressing op-ed that appeared recently in The New York Times. Madeline Halpert, a junior, and Eva Rosenfeld, a sophomore, had undertaken a Herculean task. After bonding over the discovery that both were being treated for depression, they linked up with other journalism students and gathered highly personal stories about mental illness from teenagers in their school district. Incredibly, all their subjects agreed to be identified. No unnamed sources. No pseudonyms. These were reporters who did their homework, and subjects who saw the merit of going public about their experiences with everything from depression and anxiety to eating disorders and drug abuse. The two student editors were gearing up to devote an entire edition of the paper to telling the mental health stories of their peers. And then, the head of their school put the kibosh on the project. The stories were not to be published lest they trigger bullying or further mental health problems for the afflicted students. I read the two girls' story the morning after a remarkable night of witnessing just the opposite -- the progress that comes when school administrators encourage their students to speak and write openly about mental illness. High school students in the tiny New England town of Ledyard, Connecticut, population 14,687, for six years have been competing in an essay contest called "Breaking the Silence about Mental Illness." The project got started when two Ledyard high school health teachers teamed up with the leader of a local mental health support group to invite kids to compete for annual prizes of $250, $150 and $100. The prize money comes from the local chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. I was one of four judges, which has given me a ringside seat to this work in progress at changing attitudes. Importantly, if you include our contest coordinator who oversees the project, three in our group of five are mental health professionals who can spot when an essayist hasn't gotten the facts right, or displays red flags that should be brought to the attention of a parent. All of us have a connection to mental health issues, whether it is in a lifelong professional devotion, our own mental illness, or the care of a loved one. On Wednesday night, we honored our latest crop of courageous teenage writers in a meeting room at a state mental health center in Norwich, Connecticut. Ben Coffing read his third-place essay, "ADHD Though My Eyes" and taught the audience a little something about the pain of feeling different. "Imagine being called SPED in the hallway just because you have to work harder at school than someone else," he said, referring to the derogatory slang that some students throw at special education kids. As far back as Ben can remember, kids thought he was weird because he was "a little bit different." But he also thinks having ADHD has made him "a very caring person when others have a problem or issue." I mean, can you top that, or what? Molly Barnett read her second-place winning essay, "Breaking The Silence About Mental Illness." "Try to put yourself in their shoes," she said of people struggling with a mental health condition. "Imagine going through each day, each hour, fighting the voices screaming in your head, as if you have schizophrenia." Kathleen Ferry, the first-prize winner, began to sob just a few paragraphs into reading her gripping essay about what she called the "alternate reality" of two weeks in a psychiatric hospital. I offered to read the rest, and Kathleen stood beside me as I shared her words about "going from ER visit to ER visit" in her struggle with a worsening depression. After her last line -- "I am living proof that things do get better; all you need is guidance" -- Kathleen got a standing ovation from the audience of parents, siblings, friends and local residents. And then she posed for a picture with her $250 check, and took a seat next to her mom, who wrapped her arms around Kathleen and planted two big kisses on her right cheek. Parents or guardians of our winners always show up for the big night. The contest drew 36 entries in 2008, its launch year. That inched up to 40 in 2009 and then a record-breaking 92 by 2013, just months after students in another Connecticut school got a crash course on mental illness in the Sandy Hook massacre. This year, 149 Ledyard students submitted essays -- another record. The wisdom, honesty and emotion of the entries compounds with each cycle. Mental illness in children: Where to turn What's always striking is how wide a population is affected by mental illness in such a tiny community. The two student editors in Ann Arbor observed the same thing on a larger scale. Cheryl Jacques, an essay contest judge and executive director of the Southeastern Mental Health Authority, a division of Connecticut's Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, said kids suffering with mental illness are craving information that can help them make sense of what they're feeling. Ann Arbor, consider the great results of the open conversation about teenage mental health in Ledyard. Your high school editors are on to something.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/16/living/sat-test-changes/index.html	living	College Board unveils preview of sample SAT questions - CNN.com	2014/04/16	Wednesday Apr 16 07:53:08 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- The days of memorizing arcane, recondite vocabulary words might be ending for high school students who will take a redesigned SAT in two years. An emphasis on "relevant," commonly used words is one of many changes the College Board unveiled Wednesday in an attempt to make the 88-year-old exam "more open and clear than any in our history." With fewer questions overall, the new test aims to assess students' analytical skills and better help them prepare for college. "Recent SAT results tell a troubling story about students' readiness for and likelihood for success in their postsecondary endeavors," the College Board said. "Far too few students are ready to succeed in the kinds of education and training that they will need to participate effectively in an increasingly competitive economy." The College Board released 211 pages of detailed test specifications, including sample questions to show how the test is changing. Here's a look at some examples across all sections: The new test will have fewer questions overall that are scored differently:  Multiple-choice questions will contain four answers instead of five. Instead of a point for each correct answer and a deduction for an incorrect answer, the new test will use "rights-only scoring," which means a point for a correct answer, but no deduction for wrong answers. Blank responses will have no impact on scores. In a return to previous versions, the test will be scored on a scale from 400 to 1600 instead of the current scale of 600 to 2400. With 153 questions -- 52 in reading, 44 in writing and language and 57 in math -- the new test will have fewer questions than the current version's 171 questions. But, there will be no more mandatory essay, leading to the next big change. The written essay will be optional and scored separately from reading, writing and math: It's optional in the sense that individual postsecondary institutions will determine whether they will require it for admission. Those who take it will have twice as much time -- 50 minutes -- to complete it. Instead of asking students to take a position on a presented issue, the new version aims to evaluate reading, writing and analytical skills by asking students to produce a written analysis of a provided source text. For example, the College Board documents provide a passage and asked students to write an essay explaining how the author "builds an argument to persuade his audience" by looking for "evidence, such as facts or examples, to support claims," or stylistic elements, "such as word choice" to add power to the ideas expressed in the passage. No more $5 words! "Relevant words" are in: Instead of requiring students to memorize words they might never use in real life, questions in the new test will focus on understanding the meaning of "relevant" or commonly used words from the context in which they appear, and "how word choice shapes meaning, tone, and impact." Here's an example: "The coming decades will likely see more intense clustering of jobs, innovation, and productivity in a smaller number of bigger cities and city-regions. Some regions could end up bloated beyond the capacity of their infrastructure, while others struggle, their promise stymied by inadequate human or other resources." As used in line 55, "intense" most nearly means A) emotional B) concentrated C) brilliant D) determined The test will "focus on math that matters most -- algebra: What matters most, according to the College Board, is algebra, data analysis and what it calls "passport to advanced math," which includes quadratic and higher-order equations, geometry and trigonometry. Students will have 80 minutes -- 10 minutes longer than the current version -- to answer 57 math questions. Most will be multiple-choice but some will require students to provide answers. And, unlike the current version, students will be required to put away their calculators for 25 minutes. Students will have to analyze texts based on the strength of the writer's arguments Students will be asked to demonstrate their ability to interpret and synthesize the underlying ideas of a variety of sources, from informational graphics and political speeches to fiction novels and scholarly texts. One sample question asks students to read a political speech and determine which lines support the overall argument.

You can write it with one fluid swoop of a pen or one tap of the keyboard. The most commonly used letter in the English dictionary. Simple, right? Now imagine it printed out millions of times on thousands of forms and documents. Then think of how much ink would be needed. OK, so that may have been a first for you, but it came naturally to 14-year-old Suvir Mirchandani when he was trying to think of ways to cut waste and save money at his Pittsburgh-area middle school. It all started as a science fair project. As a neophyte sixth-grader at Dorseyville Middle School, Suvir noticed he was getting a lot more handouts than he did in elementary school. Interested in applying computer science to promote environmental sustainability, Suvir decided he was going to figure out if there was a better way to minimize the constant flurry of paper and ink. Reducing paper use through recycling and dual-sided printing had been talked about before as a way to save money and conserve resources, but there was less attention paid to the ink for which the paper served as a canvas for history and algebra handouts. "Ink is two times more expensive than French perfume by volume," Suvir says with a chuckle. He's right: Chanel No. 5 perfume costs $38 per ounce, while the equivalent amount of Hewlett-Packard printer ink can cost up to $75. So Suvir decided to focus his project on finding ways to cut down on the costly liquid. Collecting random samples of teachers' handouts, Suvir concentrated on the most commonly used characters (e, t, a, o and r). First, he charted how often each character was used in four different typefaces: Garamond, Times New Roman, Century Gothic and Comic Sans. Then he measured how much ink was used for each letter, using a commercial tool called APFill Ink Coverage Software. Next he enlarged the letters, printed them and cut them out on cardstock paper to weigh them to verify his findings. He did three trials for each letter, graphing the ink usage for each font. From this analysis, Suvir figured out that by using Garamond with its thinner strokes, his school district could reduce its ink consumption by 24%, and in turn save as much as $21,000 annually. Encouraged by his teacher, Suvir looked to publish his findings and stumbled on the Journal for Emerging Investigators (JEI), a publication founded by a group of Harvard grad students in 2011 that provides a forum for the work of middle school and high school students. It has the same standards as academic journals, and each submission is reviewed by grad students and academics. Sarah Fankhauser, one of JEI's founders, says that of the nearly 200 submissions they have received since 2011, Suvir's project was a real standout: "We were so impressed. We really could really see the real-world application in Suvir's paper." Fankhauser said Suvir's findings were so clear, simple and well thought-out, it had the peer reviewers at JEI asking, "How much potential savings is really out there?" For the answer, JEI challenged Suvir to apply his project to a larger scale: the federal government. With an annual printing expenditure of $1.8 billion, the government was a much more challenging task than his school science project. Suvir repeated his tests on five sample pages from documents on the Government Printing Office website and got similar results -- change the font, save money. Will government printers embrace a change?   Using the General Services Administration's estimated annual cost of ink -- $467 million -- Suvir concluded that if the federal government used Garamond exclusively it could save nearly 30% -- or $136 million per year. An additional $234 million could be saved annually if state governments also jumped on board, he reported. Gary Somerset, media and public relations manager at the Government Printing Office, describes Suvir's work as "remarkable." But he was noncommittal on whether the GPO would introduce changes to typeface, saying the GPO's efforts to become more environmentally sustainable were focused on shifting content to the Web. "In 1994, we were producing 20,000 copies a day of both the Federal Register and Congressional Record. Twenty years later, we produce roughly 2,500 print copies a day," he said. On top of this, the Congressional Register is printed on recycled paper, which GPO has been doing for five or six years, Somerset says. One federal initiative that focuses on minimizing ink-usage is called "Printwise." Implemented 18 months ago by the General Services Administration, it teaches government offices how to default their computer settings to Times New Roman, Garamond and Century Gothic to minimize printing waste. According to GSA's press secretary Dan Cruz, they hope this type of initiative could ultimately save the federal government up to $30 million annually. Suvir appreciates the government's efforts, but he sees his project as a means of making an even bigger impact nationwide. "Consumers are still printing at home, they can make this change too," he says. Holding out hope At 14, Suvir understands how difficult such a project might be to implement -- "I recognize it's difficult to change someone's behavior. That's the most difficult part." But he holds out hope: "I definitely would love to see some actual changes and I'd be happy to go as far as possible to make that change possible." With decades ahead to lend a hand, Suvir and other young men and women like him may even be able to untangle some of the knotty political and technical issues that beset Washington, corporate suites and the world at large.

http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/14/living/schools-fashion-suspension/index.html	living	When school clothes lead to suspension - CNN.com	2013/08/14	Wednesday Aug 14 11:09:34 EDT 2013	(CNN) -- It begins again with every new school year: A student heads to class with a certain T-shirt, a wild hairdo or a new pair of shorts and soon, the phone rings. Principal G. A. Buie, from Eudora High School in Eudora, Kansas, thinks a lot of parents know what's coming. "I can't tell you how many times I have called a parent and said, 'Hey, I just want to let you know that I've talked to your son or daughter today and their clothing is inappropriate' for one reason or the other, and the parent says, 'Well I told them when they left the house they were gonna get in trouble,' " Buie said. School dress codes are nothing new, but from school to school, district to district, state to state, the guidelines are different, and changing. It seems that students and parents -- no matter how well meaning -- challenge the rulebooks time and again. A Colorado third-grader was suspended after shaving her head to show support for a friend battling cancer, because she'd violated her school's dress code banning shaved heads. Her parents expected the school to make an exception for such a brave display of sympathy. In 2010, schools around the country banned bracelets that read "I heart boobies." The bracelets were made by nonprofit Keep a Breast Foundation as a light-hearted way to increase breast cancer awareness among young people. In Easton, Pennsylvania, two middle school students were suspended for wearing them, the ACLU of Pennsylvania said, because the school said they could be interpreted as lewd. In July 2013, a federal appeals court said a Pennsylvania school district couldn't enforce its ban on the bracelets -- they're protected speech because they show support for a national breast-cancer awareness campaign, and don't disrupt school activities. No state legislatures or education departments mandate uniforms or specific dress codes, according to the Education Commission of the States, an organization that provides nonpartisan information about education policy for state leaders. Still, 21 states and the District of Columbia have passed policies that authorize districts or schools to require uniforms and other laws influence dress codes. Share your story: How do you personalize your school uniform? In 2011, Arkansas passed a law that requires districts to prohibit clothes that expose underwear, buttocks or female students' breasts. A California law requires schools allow students to wear hats while outdoors during the school day. Several states require districts to allow parents and staff to weigh in on what school uniforms should be. "Student appearance, the courts said, can be regulated if it is vulgar, indecent, obscene, insulting or if it carries a message that encourages inappropriate behavior," according to the Education Commission of the States. School policies are typically regulated by community standards, said Buie, the president-elect of the National Association of Secondary School Principals. Policies that some might see as overly conservative, or even antiquated, can stay on the books for a long time. The old rules don't always work when large school systems grow, combining multiple communities into one district, Buie said, or as families move around, bringing new ideas about what's normal or appropriate. In some cases, the rules are updated to suit changing norms. 'It wasn't offensive' Last year, 5-year-old Cooper Barton was told to turn his University of Michigan T-shirt inside-out because it violated school rules. The dress code in Oklahoma City's public schools said students may only wear shirts from Oklahoma colleges and universities. The 2005 policy was put into place to deter gang activity. "He was a little embarrassed," his mother, Shannon Barton, told CNN affiliate KWTV. "It wasn't offensive. You know, he's 5." The Oklahoma City school board changed its dress code as a result of the Barton's complaints, KWTV reported, and the Barton family was gifted with tickets to a Michigan football game. READ: Why some parents dread back-to-school shopping In almost any school, there are a few things that are likely to guarantee a student a trip to the principal's office, Buie said. Most schools ban clothes that advertise drugs and alcohol, Buie said. Shirts bearing an Einstein anti-war quote and the NRA logo and a machine gun have gotten students in trouble in recent years. But often times, it's not the crazy shirt, outrageous hairdo or visible tattoo that gets a student in trouble, Buie said. Rather, it's that they don't change the behavior they've been asked to correct. "I've never been around a school that didn't give a student the opportunity to put on a shirt that's appropriate," he said. An attitude of defiance and "What are they going to do to me, anyway?" is what leads to trouble. "They know the policies, they know the rules, but they choose to do it anyway," Buie said. 'A singular goal -- to create a safe environment' The American Civil Liberties Union says the Supreme Court has affirmed students' rights to express their opinions, as long as they don't "materially and substantially" disrupt classes or other school activities. But it warns on its website that it won't always win a dress code debate: "If you think your school's dress codes and hair codes are unfair and you want to challenge them, be aware that a court probably won't overturn the codes unless the judge finds that they're really unreasonable, or that they're discriminatory." Many school districts say dress codes are a matter of order and safety -- and nobody is exempt. In 2011 in Fremont, Nebraska, sixth-grader Elizabeth Carey was told she couldn't wear her rosary to school because it violated the school's dress code. She said it was an expression of her faith. Steve Sexton, Fremont's superintendent of schools, said local gangs were using rosaries as a symbol of gang affiliation. "There are those who want to make this an issue about religion when it's about a singular goal -- to create a safe environment for our students," Sexton told CNN affiliate KETV. Her parents said they were floored. Elizabeth said she wouldn't stop wearing the cross in necklaces or on her clothes. Wouldn't any parent be upset about their child being punished for wearing a rosary, or dying his hair pink in support of breast cancer research? Buie said there are plenty of times when a call home to parents results in the recitation of the First Amendment. It's a relatively new challenge for educators, he said. "Now we have parents that are more likely to support and defend their children as being the ones that are correct," he said. "If we've done something wrong, (parents) are going to come to us and let us know that we need to change or look at doing something differently --15, 20 years ago, that wasn't the case." Explaining the dress code and why a child was told to change, leave school or even face suspension doesn't stop parents from being offended when their kids are punished, Buie said, or from glaring when he sees them at the grocery store. While students have the right to free speech, it's the school's job to teach children that they can't infringe on someone else's rights, he said. "Those are things that are taught in schools," he said, "accepting differences." What styles would lead to discipline from your school? Do you know the dress code?

Winners of the Children's and Teen Choice Book Awards were announced Wednesday night at the seventh Children's Book Week Gala in New York, part of the the 95th Children's Book Week. Rush Limbaugh won author of the year for "Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims: Time-Travel Adventures with Exceptional Americans," while Grace Lee won illustrator of the year for "Sofia the First: The Floating Palace." These are the only awards chosen by children and teens in support of their favorite books, according to the Children's Book Council. Each year, about 13,000 children across the United States read newly published children and young adult books within their classes through the International Reading Association, in partnership with the Children's Book Council. Kids voted for their favorites online with the help of their parents and teachers, or educators submitted group ballots after polling their students. The teen finalists were chosen through a joint program with Teenreads.com, part of The Book Report Network. The top author and illustrator finalists were determined by the bestseller lists. Voters were also allowed to write in finalists that weren't listed. The Children's Book Council's vetting process ensures that voting is done by children and teens, or submitted from classroom ballot boxes, they said. "The idea was born out of the understanding that when kids are given a voice and agency in their reading choices, they tend to be a lot more excited about reading," said Nicole Deming of the Children's Book Council. "It's so important to get those gateway titles to them that will lead them to a lifelong investment in the written word." Founded by the Children's Book Council and in support of the nonprofit Every Child a Reader, the event was hosted by Kate DiCamillo, author of "Flora and Ulysses: The Illuminated Adventures" and National Ambassador for Young People's Literature. Former "Reading Rainbow" host LeVar Burton was awarded with the Impact Award for his efforts to instill "a lifelong love of reading in children." Here's the list of winners: Book of the Year, kindergarten through second grade Winner: "The Day the Crayons Quit" by Drew Daywalt, illustrated by Oliver Jeffers Finalists: "Alphabet Trucks" by Samantha R. Vamos, illustrated by Ryan O'Rourke "Chamelia and the New Kid in Class" by Ethan Long "Mustache Baby" by Bridget Heos, illustrated by Joy Ang "Bear and Bee" by Sergio Ruzzier Book of the Year, third through fourth grade Winner: "Bugs in My Hair!" by David Shannon Finalists: "Bean Dog and Nugget: The Ball" by Charise Mericle Harper "Cougar: A Cat With Many Names" by Stephen Person "The Matchbox Diary" by Paul Fleischman, illustrated by Bagram Ibatoulline "Pancho Rabbit and the Coyote: A Migrant's Tale" by Duncan Tonatiuh Book of the Year, fifth through sixth grade Winner: "National Geographic Kids Myths Busted!" by Emily Krieger, illustrated by Tom Nick Cocotos Finalists: "Hokey Pokey" by Jerry Spinelli "Prince Puggly of Spud" by Robert Paul Weston "Lawless: Book 1" by Jeffrey Salane "Battling Boy" by Paul Pope Book of the Year, teens Winner: "Allegiant" by Veronica Roth Finalists: "Clockwork Princess" by Cassandra Clare "Eleanor & Park" by Rainbow Rowell "Smoke" by Ellen Hopkins "The 5th Wave" by Rick Yancey Illustrator of the Year Winner: Grace Lee, "Sofia the First: The Floating Palace" Finalists: Victoria Kann, "Emeraldalicious" Anna Dewdney, "Llama Llama and the Bully Goat" James Dean, "Pete the Cat: The Wheels on the Bus" Oliver Jeffers, "The Day the Crayons Quit" Author of the Year Winner: Rush Limbaugh, "Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims: Time-Travel Adventures with Exceptional Americans" Finalists: Veronica Roth, "Allegiant" Rachel Renee Russell, "Dork Diaries 6: Tales From A Not-So-Happy Heartbreaker" Rick Riordan, "The House of Hades" Jeff Kinney, "Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hard Luck" What are the most popular books among kids and teens in your household or classroom?

http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/29/living/harper-lee-mockingbird-digital-book/index.html	living	Harper Lee OKs e-book version of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' - CNN.com	2014/04/29	Tuesday Apr 29 01:40:00 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Reclusive author Harper Lee has agreed to allow "To Kill a Mockingbird" to be released electronically, ending what had until now been a glaring holdout in the digital library of literary masterpieces. Lee announced her decision Monday -- her 88th birthday -- in a statement released by her publisher HarperCollins. "I'm still old-fashioned. I love dusty old books and libraries," Lee said. "This is Mockingbird for a new generation." Nelle Harper Lee hasn't published a work in more than a half-century. She's made headlines though in steadfastly fighting to keep the rights to her intellectual property protected. In 2013, the Alabama native sued her hometown of Monroe County Heritage Museum for trademark infringement, saying it was illegally using her fame for its own gain. "Historical facts belong to the world," the suit argued "but fiction and trademarks are protected by law." Lee also once sued a former literary agent for being "duped" into signing over the rights to her novel. Inspiring millions "To Kill a Mockingbird" is told through the eyes of Scout, the daughter of a lawyer in Maycomb, Alabama. It deals with a local attorney's relationship with his children and his community as he defends an African-American man accused of raping a white woman in the 1930s Jim Crow era. Its themes of racial injustice and waning innocence, grounded in characters possessing courage and tolerance, have inspired millions of readers. The 1960 novel -- the only one Lee wrote -- won a Pulitzer Prize and was made into an Academy Award-winning movie. According to HaperCollins, the novel has sold more than 30 million copies in English worldwide. It's been translated into more than 40 languages, and still sells more than 1 million copies every year. Social buzz If social media buzz is any indication, there's considerable excitement about this classic novel coming into the 21st century. "Thank you Harper Lee! To Kill a Mockingbird coming to a kindle near you in July! A present for us on her birthday!" wrote Amy Feld in a Facebook post. "Hot damn! Harper Lee okays an ebook of THE classic," wrote another, Kathy Whitlock. The e-book and digital audio will be released on July 8, the date of the 54th anniversary of the book's original publication.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/06/living/amazon-100-best-books/index.html	living	Amazon 100 books to read in a lifetime - CNN.com	2014/02/06	Thursday Feb 6 04:36:47 EST 2014	(CNN) -- Amazon released its newly curated list of 100 Books to Read in a Lifetime on Tuesday. Books on the list include Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice" (1813), F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby" (1925) and Kate Atkinson's "Life After Life" (2013). The list spans 200 years of literature, along with a wide range of genres and intended audiences; authors include David Sedaris, Salman Rushdie, J.D. Salinger, Michael Pollan and Shel Silverstein. Sara Nelson, editorial director of print and Kindle books at Amazon.com, said the list was created through taxing months of deliberation among her team, though no mathematical algorithms were used. "One of our tasks was to have books that don't feel like homework: 'eat your vegetables' books," Nelson said. "There was nothing in there except 'I loved this book when I was 12 for this reason.' We lobbied each other." The books are not ranked but rather are listed alphabetically to represent that "no book is more important than another," she added. Some books that unanimously made the cut are children's books like "Charlotte's Web" by E.B. White and "Unbroken," a nonfiction book about World War II by "Seabiscuit" author Laura Hillenbrand. Fan favorites like the first installments of the "Harry Potter," "Hunger Games" and "Lord of the Rings" series made the cut. The list also features just one of the No. 1 Amazon Best Books of the Year, Rebecca Skloot's "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks." "We tried to make sure that we had a pretty good balance of fiction and nonfiction," Nelson said. "In terms of the demographic of the writers, we never sat down and said 'we need more women' or 'we need more books from different cultural groups or countries.' But overall, when I eyeball that list, it seems to have a lot of variation." The book most hotly debated by the editorial team was George Orwell's dystopian novel "1984. " "It wasn't so much 'Is "1984" a great book?' but 'Should we put "1984" or "Brave New World"? Should we put "Lord of the Rings" or "The Hobbit"?' On a 100 book list, you probably can't put both," Nelson said. "We tried to find books that were iconic and that would lead to other books." The list leaves off classics like "Les Misrables" and "Moby Dick," though some editors argued for their inclusion. You can vote for which selections you like and suggest new ones at Goodreads. Amazon will compile a list of reader picks in the coming weeks. All the books on the list are included in the gallery above -- let us know which ones you agree with and which you think were unfairly omitted in the comments section below.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/11/living/school-sabbaticals/index.html	living	My kids are taking a school sabbatical - CNN.com	2014/05/11	Sunday May 11 10:14:04 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- A couple years ago, my husband and I realized that our family had moved out of the baby stage. The labor-intensive work of the early parenting years was behind us. Suddenly we were hurtling toward middle school and our home life was revving up. With work, school and the usual activities of suburban family life, all five of us were giving our best everywhere else. By the end of the day, we didn't have much left for each other. I wanted to slow it all down. I pitched an idea to my husband, Alex: For one school semester, from January to June, we'd take a family sabbatical. Our children are 11, 8 and nearly 5 years old -- old enough to carry their own backpacks, but not so old that they don't want to hang with us anymore. We decided to hit the pause button on everyday life and do something memorable as a family. As we worked out the logistics, we decided on two main goals: We wanted our children to spend time with their grandparents, and we wanted to travel around the United States. My husband couldn't take six months off from work, but we could plan a trip that would allow Alex to spend the workweek at home and meet up for long weekends. I talked with the principal of our boys' public elementary school about our plan and she didn't tell me it was a bad idea. Neither did our pediatrician, or our kids' teachers, when I asked their opinions. The grandparents were happy to have time with the children. Our friends told us we were either brave or nuts. The kids loved the adventure of it all, although they weren't thrilled about leaving their friends. Last December, we withdrew our children from school and signed an agreement with the school district acknowledging our responsibility for their education. 'Stop the madness' It's hard to say how often families decide to take sabbaticals. Many families homeschool their children, and a subset of those families "roadschool," packing everything into a van or RV and hitting the road for an indefinite period of time. Most sabbaticals, like ours, are designed to be temporary. Our kids are already registered for school in September, when they will enter kindergarten and third and sixth grades. The sabbatical just offers a break from a whirling dervish life at home. Amy and Keith Carney know the feeling. The Carneys, who live in Paradise Valley, Arizona, plan to leave in a few weeks for a seven-month sabbatical with their 12-year-old triplet sons and 11-year-old daughter. Keith spent more than 20 years playing and then coaching in the National Hockey League, jobs that frequently kept him away from home. Three of the Carney kids play competitive sports, and Amy said their family life became dominated by tournaments and escalating pressures at school. They vacationed in Europe but didn't find those trips relaxing. About a year ago, the Carneys started talking about taking an extended break with their children. One of the kids anxiously asked whether the trip would prevent him from getting into the National Honor Society. "I had never even mentioned National Honor Society to him," said Amy Carney. "I was like, 'You've got to be kidding me!'" Their son's anxiety served to reinforce the Carneys' concern that pressure to achieve might distract their children from enjoying -- or even noticing -- life's simpler pleasures. "I just said, 'Stop the madness.' There's so much emphasis on grades and sports," Amy Carney said. "We don't want them to think that's all there is in life." The Carneys worked with their financial adviser to plan for their sabbatical. They sold some land in Florida to buy a 45-foot Allegro bus. Keith left his coaching job with the Chicago Blackhawks. They found someone to rent their house while they're gone. Amy, a model and freelance writer, courted sponsors for their trip, and struck a deal with Kampgrounds of America to write about their travels in exchange for free campsites. "We have never camped a day in our life," Amy Carney said. "My kids have been to the Eiffel Tower, they've been to the Colosseum in Rome, but they've never been to a national park." My family's sabbatical came together differently. We live one street over from my husband's parents, but my parents are based in Florida for half the year. Our highest sabbatical priority was to spend time with them, so we decided to head south and join the snowbirds in Florida. We spent three months living two floors down from Grandmom and Pop Pop's condo, surrounded almost entirely by retirees. I worried that our hallway-running, cannonball-jumping boisterousness might ruin my parents' good reputation among their friends, but our neighbors could not have been more welcoming. The kids reveled in the grandparent-to-child ratio found exclusively in South Florida, whooping it up at condo association parties, and telling long, detailed stories to neighbors who listened patiently to every word. Pop Pop let the boys zoom golf carts around the fairways. Our daughter rode the elevator in her pajamas to have breakfast with her grandparents. Grandmom joined us for field trips, helped oversee school assignments and invited the kids to cook dinner with her. My aunt, a retired biology teacher, visited for two weeks and did science projects with each child. When the experiments were finished, we held a little science fair in the community clubhouse. We're now four months into our sabbatical. We are a family of five personalities, and not every day is an awesome day. We've had rough days, travel fatigue and homesickness. We've weathered a lice infestation, stolen credit cards, a stomach bug, one lost driver's license, a couple of ear infections and more public meltdowns than I care to recall. 'Take your opportunity when you can' As we planned the trip, I wanted to make sure the kids' time away from school would be spent wisely. I needn't have worried; there is no shortage of educational opportunities. In fact, it didn't take long to realize that if we really wanted to explore the places we were visiting, we wouldn't have much time for traditional schoolwork. We pared down the "homeschooling" part to just the essentials. The boys have continued the same math curriculum their classmates are finishing in school. My husband shuttles suitcases of library books back and forth from home, and the boys write about our adventures and discoveries. Once we decided to let learning happen through experiences, we were off and running. We learned about aquatic ecosystems at the Conservancy of Southwest Florida. We spotted manatees, dolphins, manta rays and bald eagles in the Everglades and Gulf of Mexico. We checked out Art Deco buildings and tried Cuban food in Miami. The boys were introduced to physics during a Disney Youth Education class in the Magic Kingdom. They rode Space Mountain twice, once with lights on and then with lights off, to learn how coaster designers use physics to trick our senses and increase the thrill factor on a ride. Our sons also looked forward to every one of the marine life classes they took at Sanibel Sea School, where they played on the beach and learned about sharks, pelicans and dolphins. We drove to the end of Interstate 95 and continued all the way to Key West, then boarded a ferry and traveled across the Straits of Florida to snorkel and camp at Dry Tortugas National Park. We read stories from 1890s editions of The New York Times about Dry Tortuga's Fort Jefferson, which was used as a military prison during the Civil War. At the end of March, we loaded everyone into our minivan and headed to Washington, D.C. For a month, we rented a furnished apartment and lived the city life, eating lunch from food trucks, riding the Metro and walking from museum to monument to memorial and back again. We studied American history and examined documents during a Constitution-in-Action family program at the National Archives. Our visits to the Archives, Dry Tortugas, Ford's Theatre and Arlington National Cemetery highlighted different elements of the Civil War and Abraham Lincoln's presidency. One of my favorite parts of this trip has been watching the kids gather bits of information and weave their newfound knowledge into a fuller understanding of history. We didn't plot all this out before we left home; it evolved on its own. That's what we were hoping would happen. Beverly and John Shane of Manhattan Beach, California, seized a similar opportunity when their sixth-grader was studying ancient civilizations. Six years ago, the Shanes took their two sons on a five-month trip through Europe and the Middle East. Both Beverly and John had retired from Dell computers several years before, and had long discussed taking an extended family trip. The boys were 12 and 7 at the time, and the Shanes hired Ellen Regenstreif, an acquaintance with teaching experience and a passion for travel, to put together an educational travel experience for them. Regenstreif suggested a trip through ancient outposts of the Roman Empire, and organized a journey through a dozen countries for the Shanes. Regenstreif so enjoyed planning the trip that she started Child Tours, which organizes educational trips for other families. Because their trip closely tracked the school's curriculum, the children's private school agreed to let them ship completed work to their teachers and move up to the next grade with their classmates when they returned. But both boys learned lessons that reached beyond the academic world, Beverly Shane said. One day in Turkey, a group of boys played soccer as the family walked nearby; they kicked the ball over to one of the Shane boys to include him in their game. "Things like that made you realize there are so many nice and welcoming people," Beverly Shane said. "You really have to take your opportunity when you can. I guess the perfect storm of age and career and everything kind of came together for us." 'I remember it vividly' The last leg of our trip starts this weekend, when we'll head out west to visit national parks in Utah, Arizona, Montana and Wyoming. It's hard to have much perspective on our own sabbatical while we're still immersed in it. All three children had phenomenal teachers this year, and it pained us to take them out of those classrooms. Our daughter is young for a trip like this, but she loves the time with her grandparents. Both Alex's parents and mine will join us for some of the western adventures. Just after we left home in January, as we wondered whether this was such a good idea after all, my husband got an e-mail from a professional acquaintance. Alex Lash, a 44-year-old biotech writer who lives in San Francisco, wrote to tell us his parents had taken him out of school in fourth grade to drive around Mexico in a van. His stepfather was a college professor and took the whole family on an academic sabbatical. I wanted to know what Lash remembered 35 years after his family's trip. He told me about exploring Mayan ruins, spending hours studying the road map and renting a house on the beach for a few weeks. He recalled that some of the drives were long and boring, and he laughed when he told me he made the whole family listen to the "Grease" soundtrack over and over. "I remember it vividly, a lot of it," Lash said. "It was amazing." Every parent knows there are a lot of ways to make great family memories; long, elaborate trips aren't necessary. But we wanted to give this sabbatical a shot, and we've succeeded at spending a lot of uninterrupted time together, for better and for worse. I don't know what our children will remember decades from now: The science experiments? The dinners with grandparents? The head lice? -- but I can't imagine a better outcome than hearing them laugh at the memories. Would you consider a school sabbatical for your children? Why or why not?

 (CNN) -- Screen-Free Week, the international, seven-day celebration of life beyond screen-based amusements, begins today. It's a great time to take a much-needed vacation from digital entertainment. Each year, often in conjunction with schools, organizations and whole communities, families exchange their usual screen-based leisure time activities for more time playing, creating, reading, dreaming, connecting with nature and enjoying family and friends. (Yes, we still have to use screens for work and homework.) If you can't celebrate this year, make it a point to join us in 2015. Taking a break gives us a chance to catch our breath, look at how much time we and our children spend with screens and perhaps even decide to make some important lifestyle changes. Many kids spend too much time with screens -- and it's not good for them. As a psychologist and director of an advocacy organization focused on children and families, I frequently speak to parents about the impact of media and technology on young children. What I hear repeatedly is that the recent explosion of screen devices raises increasingly complicated challenges. Digital media are so compelling, exciting and omnipresent that it's getting harder to figure out how, when and even whether to set limits. Adding to the confusion is the ubiquitous and persuasive marketing of screen products as educational for young children -- even for babies -- and that digital media are a often a surefire way for overstressed parents to keep their children occupied. Screens are a fact of 21st-century life, and kids find them entrancing. Why should we set limits or deprive young children of digital experiences? One compelling reason is that excessive screen time is linked to a host of childhood problems, including poor school performance, attention issues, sleep disturbance, obesity and more. That's why the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends discouraging screen time for children younger than 2 and setting limits on time and content for older children. Because the explosion of smart phones and tablets is so new, most of the research on harmful effects is associated with television, but emerging studies are beginning to raise concerns about time with all kinds of digital media. At the same time, research suggests that monitoring time and content can mitigate some of screen media's negative effects. As kids get older, setting limits becomes more challenging, but it's still important. By adolescence, if not before, digital technologies are often completely integrated into homework assignments, connecting with friends and gathering information about the world. That's why many families make sure to preserve screen-free family meals or institute at least one night a week when, except for homework, they all ditch their devices and spend time engaged in other activities. Since it's much easier to increase children's time with screens rather than take it away, it's helpful to recognize the need to make thoughtful decisions about media use early on. What do our youngest children actually learn from digital media? One thing they may learn is to need screens for stimulation and soothing. For better or worse, the roots of lifelong habits and behaviors form in early childhood. The experiences we have in our first years of life -- and the experiences we don't have -- shape the very structure of our brains. Limited time with quality screen media and technology can be educational for preschoolers. But digital devices are by no means essential to their learning. As for babies and toddlers, the more time children younger than 2 spend with screens, the more time they spend as older children and the harder time they have turning them off. Despite unsubstantiated corporate marketing claims that apps can teach babies as young as 6 months numbers and letters, there's no evidence that infants and toddlers learn anything meaningful from any kind of screen time. There is plenty of evidence about what they need for healthy brain development -- hands-on play, active play and face-to-face engagement with the adults who love them. Babies thrive when they're talked to, played with and read to. Time with screens takes them away from those crucial activities. What's most important for babies, preschoolers and even kindergartners is to learn how to learn. They need the time, space and silence for hands-on creative play. They need to explore the world with all their senses, to nurture their creativity and constructive problem solving and to learn social skills to build the ability to work and play with other people. They need to acquire patience, develop stamina and be able to delay gratification. They need to learn to act, rather than merely react. They need to learn to generate their own amusements and to enjoy and value their own creations. Young children can't learn most of these skills and attributes effectively from a screen. In fact, most of what very young children encounter on a screen today inhibits rather than promotes the kind of creative problem solving so essential to learning. Makers of new digital media for young children distance their products from video and television by marketing so-called educational apps and games as "interactive," but a 2012 Australian study found that only 2% of the apps marketed as education for young children promote the kind of open-ended exploration that fosters learning. For parents worried about the strain of limiting digital entertainment, Screen-Free Week is a good time to experiment and see what it's like to replace screen entertainment with other activities. After all, it's only seven days. You might enjoy it -- most people do. What are rules around screen time in your household or your children's school?

http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/24/living/wedding-food-etiquette-matrimony/index.html	living	How not to leave a wedding hungry - CNN.com	2014/04/24	Thursday Apr 24 11:34:18 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- To hear the bride tell it, all the guests should have left stuffed. In traditional New Orleans fashion, servers passed groaning trays of shrimp remoulade, mini-muffulettas, boudin balls, crab cakes, crawfish and every oyster preparation under the sun. And the open bar flowed freely. Locals chowed down and kicked up their heels. But the out-of-towners (mostly the groom's family) got progressively drunker, crankier and confused, forgoing the appetizers and roaming the reception venue for the sit-down dinner they were sure was coming. It never did. At a New Orleans-style reception, the copious, usually hand-carried hors d'oeuvres and small-plate stations are the meal. Miss them, and the best you can hope for is a slice of cake -- and a nearby restaurant that serves late. Weddings celebrate the union of two warm souls who have found each other in this often cold, lonely and wicked world. Getting to witness that should (in theory) be enough for anyone. But guests have come to expect that after buying a present, getting all dolled up and getting to the wedding on time, they're going to get fed -- and those traditions vary wildly from region to region and culture to culture. If two people from the same neck of the woods are tying the knot, the majority of guests will likely know what to expect, food and booze-wise. But if the happy bride and groom hail from different states, faiths or ethnic and economic backgrounds, there's a good chance that some guests may be caught off guard. Sometimes it's a pleasant surprise: "Oh my gosh, I could have eaten 10 more plates of that mostaccioli!" Sometimes it's less so: "No alcohol?! Can I get my present back?" To minimize rumbling stomachs, sloppy-drunk (or angrily sober) antics and hard feelings that will inevitably make it back through the rumor mill to the newlyweds, it helps to set some expectations for what will and won't be served at the reception. For the couple So much agitation and ill will can be avoided by just stating up front what kind of reception spread you're planning to have. Yes, it's potentially awkward, but so many points of wedding etiquette are. Consider it a courtesy to let your guests know if and how much they're going to be fed, so they can make plans to eat before or after, and if there is going to be anything other than an open bar so they know to bring cash (or a flask.) If it's an apps-only reception with no sit-down dinner, the clearest and most socially acceptable course of action is to say "cocktail reception," "cocktails and hors d'oeuvres" or "cake and punch to follow" on the invitation, one of the inserts or your wedding website. Setting an end point for the festivities early in the evening indicates to guests that they'll need to make alternate dining arrangements. That's easily achieved by saying that the cocktail hour will be from 4 to 6 p.m. or 5 to 7 p.m. In much of the United States, cutting a cake or serving dessert indicates the point at which guests may feel free to politely make an exit, so it's best to have that all wrapped by 8 p.m. That way, the night is young, and guests can still forage for food out in the world while they're sober enough to do so. If you're serving regionally specific fare, letting guests know ahead of time what they're in for can whet their appetite, guide them to arrive full or help them plan their wardrobe. A bride or groom's dream New England clambake, North Carolina pig picking or traditional Italian spread may be a guest's seafood allergy, vegetarian or dry cleaning nightmare. Just drop a hint in an invitation insert, on your wedding website or by word of mouth, and know that you've done your due dinner diligence. As for alcohol -- this can be tricky, but it's easy to clue guests in to what the booze situation will be. While you are under no obligation to serve alcohol or mention that you are not doing so, the reality is that many people will arrive with the expectation that they'll be toasting your nuptials with at least one glass of something higher-proof than lemonade, and that it will be on your dime. Wedding expert Emily Post advises asking family and wedding party members to share your plans with other guests as they would any other piece of wedding information. She also notes that it's fine to mention casually that there won't be any alcohol served at the event, and for large parties where not all guests are on regular chatting terms with the core cast, a discrete "please know that alcohol will not be served" may appear on an invitation insert or the wedding website. No reception issue may be more fraught than that of the cash bar. A 2010 CNN Eatocracy poll on the subject drew more than 37,000 responses and more than 700 comments, with the majority indicating that if a full, open bar wasn't provided, the beer and wine had better flow freely. Five percent of respondents said they'd refuse to attend altogether if there were no alcohol served, and 23% grudgingly agreed to the cash bar if and only if it were an economic necessity. So unless you roll with a totally teetotaling crowd, someone's feathers will get ruffled. Accept that now and forever hold your peace -- but consider letting a few of your more loquacious friends quietly spread the word so guests don't show up thirsty and empty-walleted. For the guests You like at least one (and ideally both) of these folks, right? Otherwise you wouldn't be hitching up your fancy pants and hauling over to the VFW Hall, church basement or random beach where they've decided to pledge their eternal love to one another. It behooves you to be graceful and grateful to be invited, even if you're made to stand in an empty mall parking lot to nibble Tic Tacs and swig warm fruit punch. That said, it doesn't hurt to do your homework. If the nuptials are taking place in New Orleans, grab every last scrap of alligator sausage and beignet off the tray and savor it. If you're in Pittsburgh, know to save room in your stomach (and pockets) for the thousands of cookies that female relatives have made. If barbecue is on the menu, consider not wearing your most stain-attracting silk. And as a last resort, pack an energy bar or a flask. The bride or groom will have enough on their plate, so ask a wedding party or family member what's going to be on yours. Got a wedding food or beverage horror story? We'd love to hear all about it in the comments below.

If you already know that, not because you're a bride-to-be but because you're knee-deep in bridesmaid commitments, you also know how stressful it can be to be in a wedding party. So here, we tapped Eimear Lynch, a five-time bridesmaid and author of the book "The Bridesmaids: True Tales of Love, Envy, Loyalty...and Terrible Dresses," for her guidelines to get you through the process. Town & Country: Bridesmaid dresses you'll actually want to wear 1. Always agree with the bride It doesn't matter whether she has asked for your opinion on her dress, your dress or the flowers. All she really wants is blanket approval for everything she has planned, from the equestrian-themed shower to her quirky Sophia Webster wedding shoes. "Well, I love it!" is all you ever need to say. 2. Lean in There's nothing worse than being trapped in an e-mail chain with a bunch of bridesmaids masking passive-aggressive suggestions with XOXOs. Everyone will (eventually) thank you for taking charge when it comes to planning a drama-free shower or bachelorette party. Town & Country: 10 ways to incorporate your dog into your wedding 3. Make friends Yes, interbridesmaid alliances will help you get your way in stalemates over bachelorette venue or shower gifts, but those bridesmaids and groomsmen (and wedding laypeople too, I guess) are also future friends, co-workers or boyfriends. 4. Sweat the small stuff You read that right. Weddings are high-stress and ultra-emotional, and a blowout fight can be triggered by something as simple as a mention of the bride's eligible ex-boyfriend. Speak carefully as the wedding draws near, and keep even quieter on the day itself. Elle: 25 Jaw-Dropping Celebrity Engagement Rings 5. Pick up the phone Eighty percent of pre-wedding drama could be avoided if people spoke on the phone instead of sending snippy, insensitive texts and e-mails. If you need to tell the bride something potentially upsetting (such as "I can't make it to your eighth shower" or "We cannot have your bachelorette party in the Seychelles"), do it on the phone or in person. 6. Try it on, try it on, try it on You might not want to wear your bridesmaid dress for one extra second, but you should. You'll probably get the dress months before the wedding, and there's a chance you'll gain or lose weight in the lead-up to the big day. I have been privy to a few sewed-into-the-dress situations, and I can tell you they're far from ideal. Elle: 10 Couples Who Said "I Do" In a Different Way 7. Consider your updo So you just sat down with your friend's hometown hairstylist. Say, "Do whatever you like!" and you'll end up with prom hair pinned with baby's breath. Instead, bring an inspiration photo and be specific about what you want (and don't want). Same goes for makeup. 8. Remember, this isn't even A LITTLE BIT about you Hate your hairstyle? Dislike your dress? Grossed out by the groomsmen? You can keep all that to yourself, because your job is marvelously simple: Support and celebrate the bride and her groom. Elle: 10 Destinations for a Dream Wedding 9. Drink responsibly Before you have that sixth glass of Sauvignon Blanc, think ahead to your place in the wedding album. Do you want to be immortalized in a damp bridesmaid dress with a half-undone bun and tear-streaked makeup? If so, order away! 10. Have a ball This is the one time you'll get to indulge in all-out celebration of your sister or dear friend. And you'll do it over lunch, drinks, dinner, and dancing with some people you love (and, sure, some you detest). Why not try to enjoy it?

http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/04/living/preston-bailey-decorating-with-flowers-matrimony/index.html	living	How to decorate with wedding flowers - CNN.com	2014/04/04	Friday Apr 4 09:53:13 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- If you're a celebrity, royal, CEO or athlete planning to stride down the aisle, there's one name you'll hear sprouting from everyone's lips: Preston Bailey. The Panama-born designer has spent the past three decades decorating all manner of lush, lavish events around the globe, but weddings -- complete with his signature massive floralscapes -- are where he's most deeply rooted. Bailey is far from the only flower fanatic out there: A 2014 study by the Association of Bridal Consultants showed the average wedding costs of $28,016, and including about $1,800 for "flowers and decorations." The study estimates bridal bouquets at $139, reception table centerpieces at $366, flower girl flower at $86 and flower girl petals at $84. Bailey's newest book, "Designing with Flowers," hits bookstores on April 8. CNN spoke with him about how to create a floral fantasy for your own wedding -- even if you don't have a bloomin' big budget. An edited transcript is below. CNN: Why do weddings and flowers go together so well? Bailey: The reason is simple. Flowers have always been a symbol of celebration. It's a great way to convey happiness and beauty. If you walk into a room that has flowers, you immediately respond in a very positive way. It's a mood-changing thing. You feel something. It's dealing with emotions. I really got turned on to flowers on one of the cherry blossom weekends in Washington. It was the most incredible thing in the world and I had a moment where I imagined, "What would happen if I could bring this inside?" CNN: Flowers aren't just visual. What impact are you going for with the rest of the senses? Bailey: The scent can almost transport you elsewhere. I've always felt I did a great job when I created a room with beautiful flowers and the guests are so happy and excited that they don't want to leave. I think "OK, I nailed it." I try to create rooms that are so beautiful and powerful, not just visually, but with scent, that people are happy and feel a sense of celebration. CNN: People have traditional spots for flowers in their wedding -- maybe in a bouquet, as centerpieces or tied to the ends of pews. Where should they focus their energy (and budget)? Bailey: Flowers don't need to be only in vases. They can be in a napkin or on the table or in the aisle. In the book, we have strands blowing in the wind. I'd like to encourage people to think out of the vase, in many different ways that can be exciting. You don't have to limit yourself to arrangements. CNN: Not everyone has a Preston Bailey-level budget. What can they do to get the most bang for their buck? Bailey: When I started, my first budget was $200. I very much believe today what I did then: with a smaller budget, you have to be realistic about the things that are most important. In my mind, one of the most important moments is seeing the bride walking down the aisle. That's the first impression, so you want to create a beautiful bouquet. [Editor's note: When Bailey married his husband Theo Bleckmann in 2013 at age 63, he emerged from a giant bridal sculpture that was rolled down the aisle, carrying a bouquet.] Another important location is the dinner. They're going to be sitting at the table all night, so you want invest some money in a centerpiece or a detail on a napkin. I also like to do something beautiful for the escort card arrangement, because that sets the tone for the event. But a budget's a budget. It's a matter of how much you can afford and how much you can do with it. Concentrate on the areas that are more important and visible and you'll be just fine. CNN: When people are buying flowers, what do they need to consider? Bailey: A lot of places where you buy flowers, they have matured, and they're completely open. That means that they might only last another half a day. You have to know a little bit -- how long they're going to open, what room temperature they need to open. There are flowers that last 10 days and flowers that last one day. It is important to do your research. If you're using a florist, they will know this, but if you're trying to do it yourself, my strongest advice is that if the wedding is not that same day, don't buy flowers that are completely open, because they're going to die on your big wedding day. CNN: Yikes! So how should the flowers be preserved during all the preparation? Bailey: You have to keep in mind that flowers are living beings. It's important to always cut the stems at an angle, before you put them in water. And I'm very old-school. I do not believe in chemicals of any kind. Just make sure that you change the water daily. They love fresh water. They do not like to be in a warm environment, unless you want them to open very quickly. Make sure there's a comfortable room temperature if you want them to open slowly, but changing the water daily is my best advice. CNN: How much attention should couples pay to seasonality? Bailey: You should use seasonal flowers. It's much more cost-effective, they're much more available. In the winter, we do not have a lot available; however, there are flowers like amaryllis, that bloom in December. Paperwhites bloom then, too, and they can be used as potted plants. Amaryllis, by the way, is a beautiful flower with one long stem and it's perfect for a centerpiece. After the wedding, you get to keep it for another couple of weeks. There are ways that, as a designer, I have to think about what's more practical for the season. If you buy spring flowers in the winter, it's going to be five times more expensive. CNN: I'm sure some of your clients want that! Bailey: [Laughs] Yes! You can find them, but it's a lot of cost and I would not advise that. CNN: Is there some flower you hope you never see again? Bailey: I used to say that about carnations, and I changed my mind. There are a couple of cultures that like carnations, and I'm using them now for sculptures instead of just arrangements. They're great because they're very long-lasting -- it's like a flower that never dies! But I always get into trouble when I say this, but I'm going to say it anyway: I grew up in Panama, and in my backyard, there was tons of bird-of-paradise, and we considered them weeds. So I'm not crazy about them. CNN: What flower would you love for more couples to use? Bailey: Vanda orchids. It's a very deep purple flower, and I think it's one of the most beautiful orchids around. But they are so cost-prohibitive, it's ridiculous. I can't wait for the day that somebody creates a less expensive way to make them accessible. On the more affordable side: classic roses. Throughout the year, the cost has been going down because the market is so saturated. Because so many people have been using them, roses have become very cost-effective. CNN: Let's say the couple wants to re-create the magic on their first anniversary. What would be a fun way to recreate the event on a more intimate scale, florally speaking? Bailey: I think it's great to keep the celebration going and see what flowers you used in your wedding and use them again in a different way. I remember one of my clients was celebrating a second anniversary, and we replicated the bride's bouquet. I think that was really great! Celebrate the day with some of the same flowers and I think it could be very meaningful. CNN: You may or may not be able to answer this question, but what's the biggest flower budget a client has ever given you to work with? Bailey: And you're absolutely right -- I can't answer that. It's such a bummer because I'm under confidentiality agreements. But again, it's all relative and what's a lot of money for one person is not for the other. How much did you spend on your wedding flowers, and did you get creative? Let us know in the comments below, on Twitter @CNNLiving or on CNN Living's Facebook page.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/05/living/78-year-old-twins-reunited/index.html	living	Twins reunited after 78 years - CNN.com	2014/05/05	Monday May 5 09:43:20 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- In 1936, a pregnant single woman in England made the difficult decision to give up one of her newborns, separating fraternal twins. It would be 78 years before the girls were reunited. The two women, now living on different continents, found each other when the daughter of one made a surprising discovery during some genealogical research. Her mother, Ann Hunt, had a twin sister she never knew about. The daughter, Samantha Stacey, wrote a letter to a woman in Oregon, asking if she was born in Aldershot, England. Elizabeth Hamel called England and said she was. In moments, she was speaking to her very long-lost sister. After a year of calling on Skype and getting to know each other, the two finally met on May 1 in California, a long way from Aldershot, where they were born to a mother who worked as a live-in servant. Alice Lamb was a cook and the girls' father -- a man named Peters who never met the twins -- was in the British Army, the BBC reported. Hamel said she was born with a curvature of the spine, the reason Lamb kept that daughter. She couldn't afford to keep both of them. Hamel, who lived with an aunt for the first years of her life, said she had been told as a child that she had a sister. But she knew it would be difficult to find her, especially since her twin likely changed her name when she got married. And she had no idea if her sister had moved from Aldershot, as she had done. When they saw each other for the first time, Hunt was overwhelmed. "I couldn't speak. I was so happy," she said Monday. "It's like you're dreaming. Even now I have to pinch myself." The twins don't look much alike and say they have different personalities. But during an interview with CNN, they did act like sisters, sometimes bickering lovingly and sometimes finishing the sentence for the other. Hunt said she is normally more talkative, and Hamel is the more sensible one. They both said they lead very busy lives, which will make staying in touch, already complicated because of the eight-hour time difference, a bit difficult. They share at least one trait, though, Hunt insisted. "We use our hands in a similar manner," she said. Hamel said that while they may not look the same in the face, they have the same feet. They also discovered they married men with the same first name (and same last initial). When they reunited Hamel looked for similarities. "You think, this is someone like me," said Hamel, who is 20 minutes older. Both were raised as the only child in the family, though Hunt had no idea she had a twin until her daughter told her last year. The two have exchanged gifts, something common among reunited twins, said Nancy Segal, a psychology professor at Cal State Fullerton and author of four books about twins. "These are the kinds of things that twins do for each other but here they have do those gifts a little bit more because they have to make up for all those years that they didn't share one another's lives," she said. Segal became involved with these twins when Hamel's son wrote her an email about the unique case. She interviewed Hamel and Hunt to see how environment affects twins who are raised apart. She said fraternal twins are less likely to be close friends and don't stay in contact as closely as identical twins. After spending a few days in the Los Angeles area, the twins are heading to Oregon to catch up some more, Segal said. On 78 years.

Go to CNN iReport to share your stories of people helping others, showing kindness and acting heroically in big ways and small. (CNN) -- Good people, not to mention good tippers, do exist. Christina Summitt knows that for sure now after what happened Saturday night. The paw-print tattoo on Summitt's wrist often leads to conversations with strangers about her love of animals; she's a volunteer with a pit bull rescue group and spends lots of time finding homes for animals of all kinds. While tending bar at the Holiday Inn in Clinton, New Jersey, Summitt got to chatting with a friendly couple before the night got busy. The man asked her if she had dogs of her own; she confided that her "baby," a Great Dane-black Labrador mix named Tucker, was at the veterinary hospital after having emergency surgery hours earlier after he swallowed a hard plastic ball. She was worried about him. The man said something about surgery being expensive. She confided the estimate was around $2,700, but she would do whatever she had to do for the dog, whom she adopted in 2011. Summitt, 37, works three jobs -- full-time as a chef at the hotel, Saturdays as a bartender, and as a food prep worker two days a week at a deli in her town. Her husband works full-time and Summitt has three stepchildren. The couple ordered drinks and dinner at the bar. When it was time to close out their $80 tab, the man filled out the receipt with a tip -- for $1,000. Summitt said she started shaking and crying. She showed the bill to her sister, who tends bar with her, to make sure she was seeing three zeros after the 1. "I went back over and said 'Sir, I cannot accept this, what is this for, why would you do this?'" she said. He told her to put it toward Tucker's medical costs. "I just stood there in shock. I walked around and hugged this couple. They said, 'We'll be praying for Tucker.'" Hotel manager Michelle Satanik told CNN she followed up with her comptroller and also tracked down the customer this week to verify that the gesture was legitimate. CNN has attempted to contact the generous tipper through Summitt, who kept his name anonymous for his privacy. "Apparently this man does this quite frequently. Just a really nice guy and humanitarian," Satanik said. "I have never ever seen a $1,000 tip like that." Summitt shared the story on Facebook and CNN iReport with a photo of the credit card slip and a picture of Tucker being held by her 16-year-old stepson before they left the dog at the hospital for surgery. A Facebook page she follows called "Why Bartenders and Servers Hate People" reposted the story on Easter Sunday with this caption: "This is a place for us to vent but every so often, especially on holidays, we have to be thankful for the amazing customers that are out there." Summitt says she's since gotten messages of support from all over the world. "I would also love nothing more than to publicly thank this couple in front of the world. I've never seen a random act give so many people so much hope," she wrote. Tucker is recovering at home.

Her grandmother was a contestant in the Ms. Senior Florida 2014 pageant. (CNN) -- To look at Julianne Talley, a statuesque 61-year-old beauty, one would never know she has conquered both obesity and cancer. The Ms. Senior Florida contestant glided through the Vero Beach High School Performing Arts Center with the humility of someone who underestimates her beauty. Little did she know, she was about to be crowned Ms. Senior Florida 2014. Talley's platform is one of self-acceptance and self-improvement: "It's a message to the woman in the audience who thinks 'I'm always going to be heavy' or 'I can't dance'... yes you can," she said during dress rehearsal. While we're accustomed to beauty pageants featuring women in their 20s strutting in bikinis, the Ms. Senior America pageant seeks women with "dignity, maturity and inner beauty," who are older than 60. There's no upper age limit and no bikinis are required. The oldest contestant in Florida this year was 86. Pageant organizers Hedi Headley and Helen McKnight worked for months gathering contestants from around the state of Florida. The 15 women who were selected rehearsed almost every week between January and March. The ladies were judged on their interview, philosophy of life, talent and gown presentation during the March 29 competition. The Ms. Senior America Pageant has been around for 35 years, but the state level competitions vary in their founding year. Headly and McKnight originally founded the Ms. Senior Arizona Pageant in 1990, when they weren't even 50 yet themselves. "We saw a need to encourage the older adult and especially women that feel they become invisible as they age," said Headly. Semi-retired in Florida, Headly and McKnight took over running the Ms. Senior Florida Pageant last year. The contestants evolved before Headly's eyes. "Most of the ladies have never even talked into a microphone before rehearsals," she said. The granny of yesteryear, sitting in a rocking chair knitting, is a thing of the past if the pageant is any indication. Today, women over 60 are rocking it on stage: singing, dancing, sharing their inventions and even belly dancing at senior beauty pageants around the country. The Ms. Senior pageants give contestants a chance to do something many of them never dreamed of doing in their 20s, 30s or even 50s -- take the spotlight and share their wisdom and talent with hundreds of people. In addition to the crown, Talley won "Best Talent" for singing and playing "Sentimental Journey" on the piano. Talley faced a long journey to get where she is today. Overweight most of her life, 10 years ago, she lost 100 pounds and kept it off. "I decided to enter the competition after a lot of thought and prayer, when I realized that it was an opportunity to reach my dream to touch women across the country, to inspire them to take better care of themselves, and to set goals, dream dreams, and do what it takes to reach those goals," said Talley She wants to encourage other women to become physically fit even as seniors, which is a message she will take to the Ms. Senior America Pageant this October at the Resorts Hotel Casino in Atlantic City. "It has been my dream to reach women across the country to encourage them that we 'ain't dead yet'!" said Talley. The second runner-up was Ann Palle, a 60-year-old baton twirler who leads a 105-person senior citizen baton twirling team that performs in about 55 shows a year. The oldest twirler is 95. "It's nice to get together with these ladies because we all bring something very different, but this pageant brings us together," Palle said. Each of these women has a distinct philosophy, and if laughter is the key to longevity, Lauren Luccini "Miss Congeniality," will live forever. "When I used to date, men used to open the car door for you," she told the audience in her standup comedy routine during the talent competition. "Now, I'm glad if they even stop the car." Then there was, Julie Dohan, who at 81 went from modeling to art dealing to inventing, but believes "the best is yet to come." Raven-haired contestant Lucille DiBartolo is a 79-year-old Mediterranean beauty who still gets carded for proof of her senior citizenship. (Full disclosure: This lovely lady is my grandmother, and I attended the pageant to support her.) Encouraging young women to be more confident, she added that, "it's not who you are but who you perceive yourself to be." Last year's winner, Betsy Horn, stopped by to encourage the women. An ovarian cancer survivor, Horn wrote a book, "A Little Touch of Cancer and How it Made Me Well," and encourages women to share their inspirational stories, which can come from hardship. "You can't get through life without having some event that happens that challenges one deeply and emotionally," she said. "As you get to know the ladies, you realize that everyone does have a story and that they were survivors." Horn had high praise for 2014's Ms. Senior Florida contestants: "I came away this year thinking these women all have a lot to offer, so they should all get out there and do something!"

Why their identity is so complicated - CNN.com	2014/05/03	Saturday May 3 01:15:17 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- If there's one thing everyone should know about Hispanics in the United States, it's that this rapidly growing minority has an undefined identity crisis. Why? Because of the confusion surrounding what to call people whose ethnic background is from Latin American and Spanish-speaking countries. Some even feel 100% American or 100% Latino -- or Hispanic, depending to whom you're talking. How do you know which term to use? "Hispanic" and "Latino" are often used interchangeably and aim to describe the same group of people, but technically they do not mean the same thing. What's more, within Hispanic communities in the United States, most people identify with their country of origin and often use hyphens to represent their loyalties to both cultures: like "Mexican-American." We're constantly having to straddle two worlds: the one where our families came from and where we've chosen to live. To make matters even more complicated, all that can change depending on where Latinos are in any given moment. When I'm in my parents' native country of Peru, I'm American with Peruvian parents and that's that. No matter how hard I've tried to be "Peruvian enough" to my fellow Peruvians, I might as well be a gringa in their eyes. Share your immigration story with CNN iReport And, when I'm back in United States, someone will inevitably ask me where I'm from in a way that suggests I'm not from the good ol' U.S. of A. In other words, imagine having to constantly tell people that you're made of two colors: blue and yellow, but all people see is green, and you constantly have to go in the light and show them you are made of both colors. Identifying as Hispanic or Latino comes with its ups and downs. But perhaps breaking down what these terms mean and how they're used within this diverse community of 54 million Latinos can help shed some light on our experience. Hispanic or Latino? Years ago, I attended a media networking event hoping to meet more established journalists. I remember saying something along the lines of, "Ah, the joys of being Hispanic," and an older Latina woman turned around and said, "No, sweetie, you are a Latina. Don't refer to yourself as Hispanic. The government invented that word for us." Um, OK. I think I hit a nerve. Then, a younger Latino man snickered and asked her to not take those labels so seriously. She quickly turned to him and, judging by her wide eyes and stiff demeanor, she clearly did not agree. Her eyes then met with mine and she looked at me as if I had to make a choice: Hispanic or Latino? What's it going to be? The room immediately felt as if it divided into two uncomfortable teams. I could feel the warm embrace from the "Hispanic team," which was easygoing and used both terms interchangeably, and imagined them saying to me, "Come on over! Hispanic? Latino? Whatever you feel is best." But the looming eyes of "Latino team" made me feel obligated to side with them and take some kind of political stance on the term. Using Latino had a slight "sticking it to the man" feel. I wasn't sure how I felt about identifying with either term, so I decided to hold my tongue, take a deep breath and smile. Even though this woman I had never met tried to impose her label on me, she was partially right. The term Hispanic was first used by the U.S. government in the 1970s in an attempt to count people from Mexico, Cuba and Central and South America but what she failed to mention was that the term has existed for centuries. Back then, there wasn't a private or public sector that had a uniform way of collecting data on the Hispanic community, so a committee was formed and it opted not to use Latino because, if taken literally, it could include Europeans of Latin origin. The goal was to accurately account for this growing and discriminated against population so laws could be implemented to help with their needs as well as trace their accomplishments. The term Latino finally came to fruition in the 2000 census as a more inclusive way to include mixed races known as "mestizo" or "mulato" in Central and South America. In short, Hispanic refers to language and Latino refers to geography. One reason for my ambivalence with both these terms is that I didn't grow up using either one. I was born and raised in New Jersey by my Peruvian immigrant parents in a predominantly Hispanic community where everyone identified with their family's country of origin. I was Peruvian for the better half of my life and it's perhaps why I use the terms interchangeably and have no preference. I'm not alone. Most Hispanics in the United States prefer to use their country of origin to describe themselves most often. About half said they have no preference for either term but for those who did, Hispanic was preferred over "Latino," according to the Pew Research Center. "For example, in California, the state with the largest Hispanic population, 30% say they prefer 'Hispanic' and 17% say they prefer the term 'Latino,'" according to Pew. The results were similar in Florida and New York. The only exception is Texas where there was an overwhelming preference for "Hispanic." Among Hispanic Texans, 46% prefer the term Hispanic, while 8% say they prefer Latino. But this wasn't always the case. "There was a time when Latino was primarily used in the West Coast and Hispanic on the East Coast," said Mark Hugo Lopez, director of Hispanic Research at the Pew Research Center. The use of both pan-ethnic terms are unique to the United States, Lopez added, as is the ongoing identity debate on which term to use. Latino vs. Hispanic on social media Latinos are the most active of all ethnic groups on social media networking sites -- Hispanic adults topping at 72%, followed by African Americans at 68% and whites at 65% -- and CNN recently looked into which term was used more often and in what state across the country. Even though Pew found that Hispanic was preferred over Latino when it came to identity, in the past year, CNN found that Latino was mentioned more on Twitter than Hispanic.  "From what I've seen, the term Hispanic inspires more rage than Latino," said Adrian Carrasquillo, former social media manager at NBC Latino and now editor of Latino coverage for BuzzFeed. "For a long time the Latino community has been fragmented, but now they are starting to have more cohesion and the rise of Latino is bringing people together more," he added. The term's popularity may also have to do with the sudden surge of niche sites that containin the term, like Fox New Latino or The Huffington Post's LatinoVoices or two new magazines: Cosmopolitan for Latinas and Glam Belleza Latina. CNN found the states where Google users searched the most for the term Latino from 2011-2014 were Virginia, California, Texas, Florida, Arizona and New York. The states with the highest Google searches for Hispanic were New Mexico, Texas, District of Columbia, Florida and Arizona. Google searches for Hispanic have declined over the past 10 years, while searches for Latino have remained steady and even seen an uptick in the past two to three years. The only exception each year was during Hispanic Heritage Month. "Groups like Latinos in Social Media and niche Latino sites that have launched recently have a lot to do with Latino being used more than Hispanic, but Latino refers to flavors, people and music. You don't hear people say 'Hispanic music,' they say 'Latino music,' " said Joe Kutchera, author of "Latino Link: Building Brands Online with Hispanic Communities and Content." "Latino media outlets have turned to Latino more because the term feels more inclusive, but that can always change. Younger generations are generally more accepting and don't care as much about these labels," Kutchera added. Such was the case for Lance Rios when he started the popular Latino-based community Facebook page Being Latino. He said he realized Latino held more weight than Hispanic because it was a term embraced within the community. "Twenty years ago Chicanos were Chicanos, and Boricuas were Boricuas but now it's different," Rios said. "Latino encompasses many more who can identify with having parents from different parts of Latin America." Hispanics in the United States: Fast Facts That annoying question: Where are you from? Marco Perez, founder of the United Latino Professionals, has developed a good-natured sense of humor when he is asked a question that many Latinos often hear: Where are you from? Perez said the question doesn't bother him much anymore. "I just say I was born in Guatemala but was raised in New York since I was toddler so I identify myself more with 'American' culture," Perez said. It's clearly not a one-word answer for Perez but not as complicated as some make it out to be. "Their reaction always depends on who it is, their level of education and what part of the country I'm in. But I get reactions such as, 'No, I mean ethnic origin,' but in many cases they simply leave it at an awkward, 'Oh OK,'" Perez said. There are a couple of reasons why this question is irritating to many Latinos. It implies that the person being asked is a foreigner when he or she, or his or her family, could have easily been in the United States for several generations. It also inevitably puts Latinos in a box, making them feel singled out and forced to justify their American-ness. Before I knew any better, the question also made me feel foreign, so I always had my Americana spiel ready to go: "Yes, I'm Peruvian but I was born and raised in New Jersey. And, I went to Rutgers, and watched 'Full House' and 'Saved by the Bell' growing up. I love apple pie and spend Fourth of July weekend down the shore, etc." 'Where are you from?' is not the right question The only time I feel like I'm identifying with the Hispanic or Latino label is when I'm around non-Latinos or filling out the census survey. Living in two worlds With all the "Latino boom" talk, I realized I am a part of the population that isn't just part of the changing face of America but that also is altering its economic landscape. You've heard the statistics: Latinos have a $1 trillion buying power only expected to grow. The Latino vote helped Obama get elected in 2008 and 2012. They're one out of every six people, one out of every four babies born each year. The Hispanic population accounted for more than half of the country's growth in the past decade as well as 95% of the teen population growth through 2020. And, by 2050, Latinos are projected to make up 30% of the U.S. population. That's what Hispanic marketing expert Chiqui Cartagena calls the duality of the Latino reality. "From the grocery aisle where you pick up your Corona beer and your dulce de leche ice cream, to the Billboard charts where Pitbull, Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez routinely dominate, to the lunch you order at Chipotle .... the Latino effect is everywhere," wrote Cartagena, the vice president of corporate marketing for Univision Cartagena, in an op-ed for CNN. When companies talk about the Hispanic market, they are referring to the bilingual Latino who has embraced both cultures, eats pizza and tacos, and the growing share of Hispanics who prefer to consume their news in English from television, print, radio and Internet outlets. But Pew also found that most Latinos acknowledge the importance of speaking Spanish and found that more than 34 million Hispanics ages 5 and older spoke Spanish at home, which may be the reason why English and Spanish have influenced each other so much. Fewer Latinos will speak Spanish, more non-Latinos will, report says Language isn't the only aspect of Latino culture to keep in mind when speaking to this growing community in the United States. It's also important to know that Latinos are not a monolithic culture. While a large percentage of the Hispanic market is of Mexican origin, there are still two dozen other nationalities that make up America's Latino population. Also, Latinos come in all shapes, complexions and sizes. Glenda Guevara has little patience for stereotypes these days. "I now take the 'where are you from?' as a teaching moment," said Guevara, who was born in El Salvador. "But I do get furious when I'm told that I can't be from El Salvador because I don't fit the 'look.'" Without completely losing her cool, Guevara continually responds by asking, "What exactly does an El Salvadoran look like? Please tell me what my people should look like?" Latin America's diverse racial demographics are the result of a mixed-race background of European, African and indigenous cultures. All the attention Latinos have gotten over the years has come with its fair share of stereotypes and misconceptions, some I'm able to laugh off and some I wish I could wave a magic wand and change immediately, like: Being asked to say something in Spanish (Nope, I'm not here solely for your entertainment.), to explain where exactly Peru is (Don't admit the little geography you know.), if I know someone you once met in Peru (It's a big country, the chances are impossible.), if I'm a U.S. citizen (That's never, ever appropriate.), and -- my personal favorite -- introducing me to your friend from a Latin American country because you believe we will hit it off. (Common backgrounds don't necessarily mean you are introducing me to my future bestie.) These awkward and often staggering encounters only confirm how ambiguous Latinos' collective identity is to those on the outside. But if waving that wand meant having to alter who I am or how I move seamlessly between two worlds, then I'd hold back. I can only hope that as the Hispanic community continues to grow, so will a more defined identity.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/30/living/duke-you-dont-say-identity/index.html	living	Duke University students on the 'You Don't Say?' campaign - CNN.com	2014/04/30	Wednesday Apr 30 08:47:34 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- This fall, two student organizations at Duke University met to discuss a simple idea: Put a spotlight on reasons people might take offense to phrases and slurs used in everyday conversation. The result of that conversation -- the "You Don't Say?" campaign, a photo project that points out language that marginalizes sexual and gender minorities -- has been sweeping across the Web and the Durham, North Carolina, campus. It comes in the midst of several photo campaigns at colleges around the country. At Harvard, there was the "I, Too, Am Harvard" photo project that highlights the experience of its black students. In March at Georgetown, images of administrators in drag explored the issue of gender identity. Duke sophomores Daniel Kort, Anuj Chhabra, Christie Lawrence, and Jay Sullivan co-founded the project. Kort is the president of the undergraduate LGBTQ group Blue Devils United, and Chhabra is the president of Think Before You Talk, a group aimed at bringing awareness to the implications of offensive language. Lawrence and Sullivan serve on Think Before You Talk's executive board. The students explained via e-mail why they got involved, and what they hope the photo campaign will accomplish. Their responses have been edited for clarity. Anuj Chhabra on using the phrase 'That's so gay':  I thought it was important to bring awareness to the implications that these words have because having used some of [these phrases] in high school, I quickly realized how differently other Duke students perceived me [when I commented], "That's so gay." One of my friends in particular would constantly question me: "What do you mean by 'That's so gay?'" I realized that using the word "gay" to describe a teacher who I didn't like or an unfavorable event really didn't make sense, and I began to change the habit. Our intention was to use personal testaments to let people personally challenge themselves, as opposed to "banning" these words. Our desire to use the personal "I" stems from the fact that most people, after thinking about why it is so common in today's society to equate something like "dumb" or "unfavorable" with "gay," are quick to change their habits. It is not necessarily homophobic or sexist people using such words and phrases, but largely just ordinary people. Daniel Kort on why he participated:  Throughout elementary and middle school, I was consistently bullied by my classmates because of characteristics that others deemed "gay." I was constantly called "fag" and "bitch." At times, it felt as if my entire class was against me, and I can recall only one instance that somebody stood up for me. I would cry to my mom during the car ride home, and my schoolwork and motivation suffered. With help from the school counselor, I was eventually able to stand up for myself and disregard my bullies. In my first year [at Duke], I was called a "fag" by one of my hall mates in the first month of school. I was lucky to have my friends there to intervene, but I know that not all students are as fortunate. I was motivated by the bystanders who were there for me that night, and this experience propelled my enthusiasm to work on the campaign. Though I don't have the same reaction nowadays in response to these words, I stand in solidarity with younger students who are marginalized by their classmates. Christie Lawrence on how these terms impact her and others:  All of these phrases impact me, whether they directly address me or not. I think it is important to try to be as good of a person as you can, and through conversations with my friends, I have grown to recognize the hurt these words can inflict. Even if I am not gay, I know that calling someone a "fag" or qualifying an expression of admiration with "no homo" attaches hurtful connotations to words that are directly connected to a certain identity. Telling me to "man up" or not be a "pussy" tells me that you believe women are weaker, more emotional and lesser than a man. It tells me that you think a certain way to act is the right way and anything that does not fall under the umbrella of "acceptable" behavior or emotions is something to be put down. This attitude, that there is a correct way to have courage, be successful, or achieve happiness, is something that I believe hurts everyone in our society, including myself. This campaign is not an attempt to ban words or invalidate someone's right to free speech, but instead is an attempt to show how these words are hurtful for many. One comment on an article I read about our campaign explained it very nicely: You have the right to say these offensive phrases, but we also have the right to tell you why we think these phrases are hurtful. Jay Sullivan on how language reflects values:  I am a Christian. That is the lens I bring to all the work that I do in the community here at Duke, in the local Durham community, and in my daily life. When I was in high school, I was the leader of the my school's small Christian Fellowship. I went to a private co-ed prep school in New Haven, Connecticut, called Hopkins School, and I distinctly remember during my junior year during the day of silence I was wearing an ally sticker in support of my friends who were silent. In class that day, an older friend came up to me and said, '"Look, Jay, I respect you but you need to take that ally sticker off man. You're condoning their sinful actions. You can't support them and be the leader of a Christian organization." I was quite taken aback, and after a short dialogue I took off the sticker to avoid any further conflict. That experience bothered me for a while, that I didn't take a stand to tell him, "People are people and they deserve the same rights and freedom to live the way they want that you have, as well. God loves everyone regardless of any part of their identity that you may have deemed sinful or unworthy." This campaign is not about language; it is about what this language represents. The way we talk is a reflection of our beliefs and perceptions of the world and it is vital, at least for me, to examine whether what I say is in line with my values and how I view the world.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/15/living/millennial-inevitability-identity/index.html	living	The myth of millennial inevitability - CNN.com	2014/04/15	Tuesday Apr 15 07:48:08 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Erica Williams Simon is a social impact strategist and World Economic Forum Young Global Shaper. She tweets@ericawilliamsdc.  (CNN) -- The millennial generation is big, diverse and changing the American landscape. A new infographic and book, "The Next America," by Paul Taylor and the Pew Research Center, examines the data about the change. It's revelatory. Taylor calls the demographic transformations "dramas in slow motion." The Gen Y -- or millennial -- generation's lack of religious affiliation, indifference to political parties and strong liberal views are a contrast to previous generations. Additionally, a great deal of the "next" in "The Next America" has to do with racial and ethnic identity. Immigration, intermarriage and the growing percentages of people who identify as mixed race are drastically recoloring the nation's racial tapestry. Today, just a half-century after interracial marriages were illegal in one-third of the states, nearly 1 in 6 newlyweds marry across racial lines. Immigrants and their children are projected to make up about 37% of America's population by mid-century, the highest share in our history. But what does this all mean? There is often a focus on data highlighting the size and diversity of the millennial generation, drawing the conclusion that it is inevitable that our values will soon take over. But research shows other factors are equally important: Our generation's economic insecurity, dependence on our parents and most notably, the unprecedented size of the older generation. I want to challenge the notion of inevitability, that just because we are more diverse, liberal and "huge," millennials will soon win the culture wars and easily transform our society to reflect our values. In my early 20s, as a Gen Y proselytizer and a person of color, I thought I knew exactly what the demographic changes meant: Millennials, in all of our black, brown and liberal glory, were taking over politically. I spent the early part of my career working on progressive policies and cause campaigns geared toward youth and diverse communities. I even founded a program that applied a racial equity lens to public policy development in part because of the country's changing demographics. The unspoken premise was this: Political elites had better "get hip" and start authentically working toward equity. Otherwise, they would be left in the change-making millennial dust. This premise was grounded in what I now call the myth of inevitability. Although I worked hard to increase civic engagement, activism and community involvement amongst my peers, deep down inside, I believed that the odds were in our favor. We would inevitably win the culture wars because of our sheer size and diversity. I believed that increasing our involvement and voice would make the difference of when the United States would be transformed to reflect our values, not if. I was not alone. Others deeply believed this to be true, too. But there are a few important factors that we forgot to consider. First, the country isn't just young and diverse. It is also getting old very quickly. The second major demographic "drama" detailed by Pew is one of older Americans living longer than ever before. Ten thousand baby boomers will turn 65 every single day between now and 2030. For the first time, by 2060, there will be almost as many Americans older than 85 as younger than 5. Thus the joke about "waiting for the older generation to die off" to see our political and social goals realized isn't just crass: It not a realistic path to social change. And that's not all. There are other cultural realities standing in the way of an "inevitable" political takeover. Millennials are economically insecure, politically unaffiliated and, according to Pew, not at all interested in generational warfare. Unlike previous generations, we actually like our parents and grandparents -- perhaps because we're still living with them. Suddenly, revolution doesn't look as inevitable as it once did. But it is still possible. I propose that the value wars that play out on issues such as immigration, women's rights, equality, criminal justice and America's treatment of the poor will be determined by three factors: participation, leadership and systems innovation. Participation in the political process is key. In the research from Pew, it confirms that millennial voting has actually been remarkably solid, increasing and staying strong in presidential elections since 2004. If this continues, adequate political representation should follow. But leading and participating in the system is not enough when the systems are broken, such as the impending doom around Social Security and other programs if left as is. The only way to fix them is to innovate and create them anew. Innovation can come from first learning the ins and outs of the current system, applying creativity and technological prowess to the problems and third, taking the risk to experiment and start enterprises that challenge the status quo if and when necessary. The data about the country's race and age transformation is clear. But millennials will only make a transformational political impact when we take the reins, lead and recreate the United States from the inside out. Now that will be a demographic drama worth watching. Share your thoughts in the comments, on Twitter @CNNLiving or on CNN Living's Facebook page.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/01/world/asia/malaysia-airlines-plane/index.html?eref=rss_mostpopular	world	Report: MH370 disappearance a criminal investigation - CNN.com	2014/04/01	Tuesday Apr 1 12:48:29 EDT 2014	Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- The investigation into Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is now classified as a criminal investigation, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing the Malaysian police chief. Inspector General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar said authorities have already recorded more than 170 statements and will interview more people for the Flight 370 probe, the Journal said. But Bakar cautioned that what happened with Flight 370 might still be unknown after the investigation. He added that the investigation into the flight simulator in the pilot's house is still inconclusive. Authorities are awaiting an expert's report on the simulator, he said. After three and a half weeks, the search for the missing plane has come down to this: a lot of floating rubbish, hundreds of heartbroken relatives and, now, quibbling over words all acknowledge offer no clues into what happened to the doomed plane. Malaysian authorities on Tuesday released the transcript of radio chatter between air traffic controllers and the plane in the hour or so before it vanished while flying from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing on March 8 with 239 people on board. The transcript shows the last voice transmission from the doomed plane was "Good night Malaysian three-seven-zero" -- not the "All right, good night" transmission authorities had previously used. The comments are "exactly what you'd expect" in a cockpit, airline safety expert John Gadzinski told CNN's "The Lead." Still, even if this new transcript offers no clues about the plane's mysterious disappearance, the discrepancy has provided fresh fodder for critics of Malaysia's handling of the investigation. Read the cockpit transcript That authorities gave one version and let it stand uncorrected for weeks undermines confidence in the investigation, air accident investigation experts told CNN. "High criticism is in order at this point," said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. And Michael Goldfarb, a former chief of staff at the Federal Aviation Administration, added that people following the investigation "haven't had a straight, clear word that we can have a lot of fidelity in." "We have the tragedy of the crash, we have the tragedy of an investigation gone awry and then we have questions about where we go from here," he said. Malaysian officials have defended their work, with acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein recently saying, "History will judge us well." Regardless of one's assessment of Malaysia's response, that doesn't change the immense challenge it faces -- especially given the few apparent details on altitude, speed and, of course, location. "They are looking in a vast area in very deep waters, ... and we really have no idea where it went in," Bill Schofield, an Australian scientist who helped create flight data recorders that could be key in determining what happened, told CNN. "... A needle in a haystack would be much easier to find." Inside the flight simulator Search 'could drag on' After refocusing their search Friday to a new patch of Indian Ocean hundreds of miles from where they had been looking, authorities still haven't found anything definitively linked to Flight 370. Ten aircraft and nine ships crisscrossed a 46,000-square-mile (120,000-square-kilometer) search zone on Tuesday. With so many planes in the skies over the search zone, Australia sent an airborne air traffic control plane to guard against accidents. The search zone for Wednesday shifted eastward toward the Australian coast from what it had the day before, according to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. While this means new territory will be covered, officials caution against expecting an imminent breakthrough. "It will take time," retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, the head of the Australia's new Joint Agency Coordination Centre, said Tuesday. "It's not something that's necessarily going to be resolved in the next two weeks." The plane disappeared over the waters between Malaysia and Vietnam, after signing off with Malaysian controllers, but before checking in with their counterparts in Vietnam. Authorities don't know what happened on board after that, but radar and satellite data show the plane turned off course and flew back across Malaysia before turning south over the Indian Ocean. Based on sophisticated analysis of satellite data, investigators believe it went down in the southern Indian Ocean, but they can't pinpoint a location. A Malaysian government source told CNN on Monday that the airliner's turn off course is being considered a "criminal act," either by one of the pilots or someone else. In a background briefing given to CNN, Malaysian investigators said they believed the plane was "flown by someone with good flying knowledge of the aircraft." A senior Malaysian government official last week told CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes that authorities have found nothing in days of investigating the two pilots that leads them to any motive, be it political, suicidal or extremist. "It's one of the great mysteries of our time," Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in a radio interview Wednesday from Perth, where he'll host his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak later in the day. "...We owe it to the world, we owe it to those families to do whatever we reasonably can do get to the bottom of this." More help on the way Chinese relatives of passengers got a chance Wednesday to learn how the search is unfolding and how it's been concluded that the flight ended in the Indian Ocean. Malaysia Airlines and Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation led a closed-door briefing with the Chinese kin in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian government said. Technical experts from Malaysia, China and Australia were also expected to participate, as was the Chinese ambassador to Malaysia. Meanwhile, even more assets are contributing to the search. Hishammuddin tweeted the HMS Tireless, a British nuclear submarine, will take part. It'll be joined by an Australian ship with a pinger locator designed to listen for locator beacons attached to the plane's flight data recorder plus a submersible capable of canvassing the ocean floor for wreckage. Both pieces of technology come from the U.S. Navy. The equipment won't be of any use, however, until searchers are able to find wreckage from the plane to help narrow the search zone. That's because neither the pinger locator nor the submersible can quickly scan the enormous area being searched. Under the best of sea conditions, the pingers can be heard 2 nautical miles away. But high seas, background noise, wreckage or silt can all make pingers harder to detect. It will take the ship, the Ocean Shield, two more days just to get to the search zone, leaving precious little time to locate the flight data recorders before the batteries on its locator beacon run out. Time is running out: The batteries are designed to last 30 days. Wednesday is the 26th day that authorities have been looking for the plane. There's no guarantee it will be found anytime soon. For all the expertise and technology, there's still more unknown about Flight 370 than is known about it -- including its altitude, precise speed and, especially, its final resting place. As CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said: "We're seeing what amounts to a big guess."

http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/31/health/africa-ebola/index.html?eref=rss_mostpopular	health	Ebola toll rises in 'unprecedented' outbreak - CNN.com	2014/03/31	Monday Mar 31 07:42:24 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- An outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in West Africa has spread to Guinea's capital and beyond its borders in an "unprecedented epidemic," a leading aid agency reported Monday. A total of 122 patients are suspected of contracting Ebola and 78 have died, Doctors Without Borders said. Most victims have been in Guinea, but the World Health Organization reported Sunday that two deaths in Sierra Leone and one in Liberia are suspected to have been caused by the Ebola virus. Cases have been identified in three provinces in Guinea near the borders and in Conakry, its coastal capital, said Mariano Lugli, the Doctors Without Borders coordinator there. "We are facing an epidemic of a magnitude never before seen in terms of the distribution of cases in the country," Lugli said in a statement issued by the organization. Previous outbreaks "were much more geographically contained and involved more remote locations," he said. "This geographical spread is worrisome, because it will greatly complicate the tasks of the organizations working to control the epidemic," Lugli said. The organization, also known by its French name Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) describes Ebola as "one of the world's most deadly diseases." It spreads in the blood and shuts down the immune system, causing high fever, headache and muscle pain. It is rare but creates panic, because there is no cure and it's fatal in up to 90% of cases, according to MSF. The variant seen in the Guinea outbreak is the so-called Zaire strain, which Lugli called "the most aggressive and deadly." READ: What is Ebola and why does it kill?  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/01/politics/obamacare-midterms/index.html?eref=rss_mostpopular	politics	Republicans hit a nerve when it comes to Obamacare - CNN.com	2014/04/01	Tuesday Apr 1 01:13:46 EDT 2014	Washington (CNN) -- Republicans are going all in, hoping that the payout is big. Like control of the Senate, big. Their big bet: Obamacare. The deadline to enroll in the Affordable Care Act for the year has come and gone. The Obama administration is touting the enrollment numbers as a successful first year, but Republicans think voter anger over the law is here to stay. And so, Republicans running for House and Senate continue to make it central to their campaign. In the Arkansas Senate race, Republican challenger Tom Cotton is using Obamacare to fund-raise for his race against Democratic incumbent Mark Pryor. The first screen on Cotton's website is a plea for contributions that says, "Obamacare is so bad that Obama doesn't want it. Tell him neither do I." Fund-raising schemes and campaign advertisements are central to Republican races in red and swing states around the country. Republican confidence When Republican David Jolly beat Democrat Alex Sink in Florida's special election for the 13th Congressional District in March, Republicans attributed the win in part to the health care law. "His (Jolly's) victory shows that voters are looking for representatives who will fight to end the disaster of Obamacare," Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and co-chair Sharon Day said in an email blast to reporters after the results were tallied. The deep-pocketed group Americans for Prosperity is playing in dozens of races around the country, and its sole weapon is Obamacare. "We do want to make sure that Obamacare is the number one issue in the country," Tim Phillips, president of AFP, said in a recent interview. The organization, backed by the wealthy partisans David and Charles Koch, has already spent more than $30 million this election cycle and plans to spend a great deal more to ensure that Democrats "have to explain" their support of the law. Public opinion Republicans believe they have a winning issue, insisting that Americans are opposed to the law. And most polling is on their side. According to the most recent survey conducted just over a week ago by CBS News, 53% of Americans gave the law a thumbs down, compared to 41% saying they approve of it. That's in line with most polls. But that could be starting to change. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll released last week found that the gap between approval and disapproval of the law narrowed to 8 points. And a new Washington Post/ABC poll out Monday found that 49% support the law compared to 48% who don't. Public action While polls are indicative of voter opinion, they don't indicate voter action. What does, however, is enthusiasm, and Republicans have that on their side. In a midterm election, when people are less likely to vote, voter turnout is critical and Obamacare gives Republicans an advantage. "This data pretty clearly shows that even though attitudes regarding the ACA are 'baked in' with voters (68% feel strongly one way or another about the issue), the intensity is clearly on the negative side, as GOP voters clearly dislike the new law more than Democrats are in love with it," said GOP pollster Neil Newhouse, a co-founder of Public Opinion Strategies. Voter apathy is a challenge that Democrats must overcome. Republican strategy: Invoke doubt Republicans are hitting a nerve when it comes to Obamacare. They are appealing to their base's mistrust in the President. Republican Sen. John Barrasso on "Fox News Sunday" alleged the administration is "cooking the books" regarding the program's rollout numbers. This includes the latest number that more than 6 million have enrolled. And Republicans constantly raise questions: Who are the people enrolling and did they have health insurance beforehand? Obamacare was pushed by the President and passed by Congress in 2010 with no Republican support as a way to narrow the gap between those with coverage and the tens of millions without it. White House spokesperson Jay Carney said Republicans are grasping at straws as the law takes hold and people begin to see benefits. "I know it leaves them with the need to go back to the drawing board when it comes to other means of trying to attack a law that is providing opportunity and security to millions of Americans," Carney said. Republican risks Pounding an issue into the ground does bring some risks -- voter annoyance. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that 53% of Americans are tired of hearing about the law. Republican pollster Whit Ayers said there's a more powerful factor in voter fatigue: Obama himself. Six years into a President's term, "people get tired of that person's leadership," he said. "Especially this President's." Democrats' challenge The goal is to get Democrats to the polls. Democrats, however, have a more complicated role that consists largely of defense. While they are being attacked on the campaign trail over the law, they have decided to respond in a multipart way by saying that some of the law is great, but some parts need to be fixed. That's exactly what endangered Democrats, including Sens. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Alaska's Mark Begich, did when they and several colleagues penned an op-ed laying out the parts of the law that they said need to be changed. Rep. Steve Israel, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, an organization that works to elect Democrats to Congress, is fighting back by highlighting the "cost of repeal." The organization is telling stories of people who live in districts with contested congressional races who say they could not afford health coverage without the Affordable Care Act. "Americans do not want to repeal the ACA and go back to the days when insurance companies had free rein over health care; they want it fixed and improved. But this Republican Congress is obsessed with a repeal that will force hardworking families into bankruptcy and let insurance companies deny care and drop coverage," Israel said. It's a difficult way to convince people to turn out to vote, even if public opinion drastically changes in favor of the law. In the March Florida special election in a swing district in a swing state, the only test case analysts have to monitor in the current political climate, Sink embraced only parts of the law. She also talked about what needs to be fixed, a strategy that didn't work. But as of now, Democrats don't want to be talking about it. That's why they are focusing on economic issues such as minimum wage and equal pay for women. New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is a member of Senate Democratic leadership, said people aren't focused on Obamacare. "Most Americans want to hear something positive. 'What are you going to do for me?' Republicans are going to give them no answers on that," Schumer said. But former President Bill Clinton said Democrats cautioned against running from the law they championed and passed. "I thought that Democrats had a tendency to shy away from things they had done that were unpopular, (and) talk about positions they had that were popular. And that my own experience had convinced me -- going back to '94 and even more when I was governor -- that that was always a terrible mistake," Clinton said this week.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/01/world/europe/ukraine-crisis/index.html?eref=rss_mostpopular	world	Ukraine crisis: NATO suspends cooperation with Moscow - CNN.com	2014/04/01	Tuesday Apr 1 02:51:48 EDT 2014	Brussels, Belgium (CNN) -- NATO will suspend "all practical civilian and military cooperation" with Russia because of its annexation of Crimea, saying it has seen no sign that Moscow was withdrawing troops from the Ukrainian border. Foreign ministers from the 28 members of the Western military alliance met in Brussels on Tuesday for the first time since Russia grabbed the Black Sea peninsula from Ukraine last month, triggering the worst East-West crisis since the Cold War. They were discussing ways to boost NATO's military presence in formerly communist central and Eastern Europe to reassure allies worried by Russia's moves. After the session, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Russia has challenged truths that only a few weeks ago seemed self-evident: that European borders in the 21st century would not be redrawn by force. "It is important for everybody in the world to understand that the NATO alliance takes seriously this attempt to change borders by use of force," he said. "So that is the wake-up call." Russia's aggression "is the gravest threat to European security in a generation and it challenges our vision of a Europe whole, free and at peace," NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters. In a joint statement announcing the suspension of cooperation, the ministers said political dialogue in the NATO-Russia Council could continue, "as necessary, at the ambassadorial level and above, to allow us to exchange views, first and foremost on this crisis." They said they would review NATO's relations with Russia at their next meeting in June. NATO and Russia have cooperated on an anti-narcotics operation in Afghanistan, counterpiracy and various counterterrorism measures. Rasmussen said cooperation on the anti-narcotics operations would continue. A NATO official told CNN the ministers had decided the alliance would develop, as a matter of urgency, "a series of additional measures to reinforce NATO's collective defenses." These would include possible deployments and reinforcements of alliance military assets in Eastern European member states, a possible review of training and exercise plans in the near term, a possible increase of the readiness level of the NATO Response Force, and a possible review and update of NATO defense and military plans, the official said. Russian troops on border Earlier, Rasmussen said he saw no sign that Russia is pulling its forces back from the border with Ukraine. "Unfortunately, I cannot confirm that Russia is withdrawing its troops," Rasmussen said at the opening of the two-day meeting. "This is not what we're seeing. And this massive military buildup can in no way contribute to a de-escalation of the situation." Concerns are high that Russia, which U.S. officials last week said had about 40,000 troops near the frontier, might seek to enter eastern Ukraine, after it annexed Ukraine's Crimea region last month. Russian President Vladimir Putin told German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday that he'd ordered a withdrawal of some Russian troops from his country's border area with Ukraine, Merkel's office said. The news prompted U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki to say Monday that if the reports were accurate, "it would be a welcome preliminary step." On Tuesday, Merkel told reporters: "I can only take what the Russian President has told me. I will, of course, try to find out whether this is perceptible or not perceptible." According to Russian state media Monday, one Russian infantry battalion was being moved from the border area to its base deeper in Russia. A battalion would typically number several hundred troops. But Rasmussen appeared to quash hopes that the situation might be easing with his remarks Tuesday. His assessment was echoed in Brussels by UK Foreign Secretary William Hague, who said: "We have had some statements or rumors from Russia about pulling back forces from the eastern border of Ukraine. "But we haven't seen the evidence of that yet. Of course, we continue to call for that and continue to use every possible diplomatic lead to seek a de-escalation of this crisis." Kerry, among those in Brussels for the NATO meeting, also called for a Russian withdrawal in lengthy weekend talks in Paris with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov. What do we know about Russia's troop buildup on Ukraine's border? Also Tuesday, the U.S. House gave final congressional approval to legislation that would impose sanctions on Russia for its takeover of Crimea and provide $1 billion in loan guarantees to Ukraine. The bill now goes to President Barack Obama for his signature. In a statement, the White House said the President welcomed the move. "This legislation will allow us to provide crucial support to Ukraine through loan guarantees that will facilitate access to needed financing to Ukraine as it takes essential steps to restore economic stability and return to growth and prosperity," it read. NATO and Ukraine cooperation  The foreign ministers also met with Ukrainian acting Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsia in the latest demonstration of Western support. Moscow does not recognize Ukraine's new government, saying President Viktor Yanukovych was removed in an unconstitutional coup. In a joint statement, they called on Moscow "to reverse the illegal and illegitimate 'annexation' of Crimea; to refrain from any further interference and aggressive actions in Ukraine ... and to abide by international law." At the same time, NATO and Ukraine announced they would intensify cooperation and promote defense reforms in Ukraine through training and other programs. Rasmussen told reporters the ministers agreed to help Ukraine make its military "more professional and more effective" and provide advice on how it can defend its infrastructure. "A possibility is also deployment of mobile training teams as and when appropriate," he said. Pressed on how NATO was prepared to help Ukraine improve its military, Rasmussen cited enhanced military exercises as an example. As the talks got under way, Russia's Foreign Ministry had warned Ukraine against seeking integration into the defense alliance. Discussion of the issue while Yanukovych was in power "led to freezing of Russian-Ukrainian political communications, to headaches in the relationship between NATO and Russia and, what is the most dangerous, to the deepening of the split of Ukrainian society, the majority of which doesn't support the idea of Ukraine entering NATO," a Foreign Ministry statement said. It added that Kiev must understand that the prospects for future cooperation between Ukraine and Russia, including on economic matters, "will largely depend on the actions Ukraine takes in its foreign policy." Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula last month amid the political upheaval that followed the ouster of the pro-Moscow Yanukovych. Ukraine's parliament on Tuesday granted permission for foreign military units, including some from NATO countries, to conduct military exercises in Ukraine in 2014. Such military exercises by foreign troops, including naval drills in the Black Sea, are an annual event but take on additional significance this year in light of Russia's military takeover of Crimea. Gazprom hikes natural gas price In a move that will heighten pressure on the interim government in Kiev, Russian energy giant Gazprom announced a sharp increase in the price it charges Ukraine for natural gas. Starting Tuesday, Ukraine will be charged $385.50 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas, up from the previous rate of $268.50, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted Gazprom Chief Executive Alexei Miller as saying. The move ends a discount that was agreed to before Yanukovych was ousted in February after months of street protests. The gas price hike will only increase the pressure on Ukraine's interim government as it seeks to stave off economic collapse. Ukraine, which is heavily reliant on Russia for energy, is also $1.7 billion in arrears in its payments for gas already supplied, Miller said, according to RIA Novosti. The International Monetary Fund last week agreed to lend Ukraine up to $18 billion over the next two years in return for a package of reforms, including to its energy market. Kiev has been running dangerously low on cash to pay for imports and service its debts since the ouster of Yanukovych, which killed off a $15 billion financial lifeline from Russia. Is Crimea gone?

http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/31/showbiz/tv/himym-finale/index.html?eref=rss_mostpopular	entertainment	'How I Met Your Mother' ends a legendary run - CNN.com	2014/03/31	Monday Mar 31 08:04:07 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- After 208 episodes, countless "legendarys!" and any number of pineapple incidents, slaps and slutty pumpkins, "How I Met Your Mother" came to an end Monday night. Throughout the final season, the show hinted at who the mother is. Still, the nine-year-long story that future Ted Mosby had been telling his kids ended with plenty of surprises. Now that we've said goodbye to Ted and his friends and the hit sitcom that often challenged the conventions (like, say, telling stories in chronological order), let's turn to the cast and the creators as they look back. Kids, here's how they'll remember "How I Met Your Mother." How they knew the show would last Carter Bays (co-creator): When we first started making the show, we had this weird, nave idea that it would run a long time. It was our first show and we didn't really know about how often shows get canceled, but there was always this special feeling about the show, that it would really last a while. Craig Thomas (co-creator): The cast were like, "This is too fun, this is doomed to fail, we can't be allowed to do this for nine years." And we were just stupidly optimistic. It could have failed a few times, but thank God it didn't. Pamela Fryman (director): The pilot was so special, getting to discover who these characters were to become. Whether it's a two-minute date or a song-and-dance number, everything has made me better. If you asked me before if I could do any of those things, I'd probably say no. Josh Radnor (Ted Mosby): I remember feeling that first episode with Ashley Williams, I remember Pam called us into watch that. I remember thinking, "This is a really special show." It does things differently than other shows. It uses so many different styles. We half-intentionally created something new and we hope it will stick around. How much impact guest stars had Bays: Having Britney Spears here was pretty memorable. We were such a garage band show, we were doing OK in the ratings but weren't really on anyone's radar, then suddenly this international superstar parachutes into the set and it was a very bizarre week. Alyson Hannigan (Lily Aldrin): Jennifer Lopez was adorable. She called my little girl a coconut. How they made their favorite episodes Neil Patrick Harris (Barney Stinson): Barney had a big musical number about suits on the 20th Century Fox lot, like an old Gene Kelly musical, I even swung around a lamppost. I loved that episode, plus I got to sing and dance. Cobie Smulders (Robin Scherbatsky): I loved our "Two Minute Date" with Josh and Sarah Chalke. I love anything that involves music. Carter and Craig are so musical. They were in a band together and I was really happy that they brought their musical talent to our show. Hannigan: There was one scene where I was pregnant with my first baby. Marshall was meeting me at the airport and had this marching band play for me and greet me at the airport. It was really awesome. Radnor: I love when you get to see what's in Ted's heart. When he's just really present with someone. I did some great stuff with Cobie this year. I've had a nice parade of co-stars, co-girlfriends for Ted. Everyone brings out something different from me. How they feel about the show's catchphrases Hannigan: I really like "you son of a bitch"... "youuuu son of a beetch." Harris: I like the way Barney uses "legendary," because it's a very loaded word. No one should ever use the word "legendary," because if you're talking in the present tense, you sound kind of pompous. Unless you're Barney Stinson, because he thinks every single thing he does is massive. "This interview right now is legendary. This will be in the Smithsonian!" How they spent nine years Jason Segel (Marshall Eriksen): Watching my co-stars have their children was special. I didn't literally watch the act of giving birth, but it's been special watching them grow up. Smulders: A lot of these people have been here for the whole nine years. We have a family dynamic on our set and I will miss that. Hannigan: I went through both of my pregnancies on the show. Harris: I'm gonna miss "It's Wednesday, we've gotta go to work." Now it's Wednesday, I've gotta get a job. Thomas: We've worked so hard for nine years, we don't have any friends. These nine characters are our friends. Thank God we have each other. How they said goodbye Smulders: We had our last table read and I cried puddles of tears. It's such a good group of people, such a great show. I get to play such a wonderful character. I'm so blessed and I'm sad to say goodbye, but we've been blessed to be on the air for nine years which doesn't happen anymore. Thomas: We're five seconds from crying at any given moment. Segel: I don't want to go out on a limb, but I will. This is potentially the best finale of any show ever ... with the possible exception of the second "Newhart" series.

The drone crashed on the Baekryeong Island on Monday afternoon, the ministry said -- soon after North and South Korean artillery batteries exchanged hundreds of shells across their western sea border. The South Korean military is investigating. The country's Yonhap news agency, quoting an unnamed government source, said the drone crashed near the western sea border, known as the Northern Limit Line after the artillery exchange -- raising the possibility that it was a North Korean reconnaissance plane.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/01/politics/obamacare-signups-target/index.html?eref=rss_mostpopular	politics	Obamacare hits goal with 7.1 million sign-ups, President says - CNN.com	2014/04/01	Tuesday Apr 1 07:00:37 EDT 2014	Washington (CNN) -- A last-minute enrollment surge enabled the White House to meet its original sign-up target for the Affordable Care Act, a surprising victory for the Obama administration after a rocky rollout of the program that has become a political hot potato for Democrats and a rallying cry for Republicans. President Barack Obama said on Tuesday that 7.1 million people had signed up on federal or state exchanges for coverage under the health care law now often known as Obamacare. The enrollment period began anemically in October with a faltering federal website and ended with a crush of people trying to beat Monday's deadline to get coverage. Not everyone who has selected a health plan has paid for it yet, officials said. Nevertheless, Obama claimed victory at a White House ceremony, saying the program approved by Congress in 2010 -- with no Republican support and vilified relentlessly by the GOP as government overreach -- has been a force for good. He said it wasn't perfect, acknowledging the early difficulties in selecting a policy on HealthCare.gov, and he predicted more hurdles in carrying it out. But the overall goal of starting to narrow the gap between those with health coverage and those without it has begun, and millions of Americans are embracing it, Obama said. "That's what the (law) is all about, making sure all of us and all our fellow citizens can count on the security of health care when we get sick," he said, noting that the "law is doing what it's supposed to do. It's working." The numbers The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office originally projected the 7 million enrollment target for the October through March period, which was adopted by the administration. Expectations plummeted throughout the fall and into this year after the early website problems, which Obama called "several lost weeks." But signs of a pickup began in late January and continued into February and early March despite a fierce campaign by Republicans to demonize the law as unworkable. Administration officials said an absolute crush of people pushed the program -- Obama's chief domestic accomplishment -- over the finish line at the 11th hour. More than 4.8 million visits were made to HealthCare.gov on Monday alone. Officials stressed that the 7.1 million figure represents only those who signed up for coverage. Those who came in late and encountered technical problems have until mid-April to complete the process. Private insurers are providing the coverage. Health of Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told an Oklahoma TV station on Monday that insurers were reporting that 80% to 90% had paid so far. The law also includes expanded Medicaid insurance for the poor in many states, but those participants are not part of the sign-up total. The politics Republicans, especially in the House, have waged a nonstop campaign to repeal or roll back the Affordable Care Act, saying it was rammed through Congress without their input and now is another illustration of big government at its worst. They have made it a rallying cry of their fall campaign to expand their majority in the House and reclaim the Senate. It has energized the base, and the issue informs the commentary of potential GOP candidates for president as well. Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said in a statement that the law "continues to harm the American people" despite Obama's "victory lap." He said costs are not going down, as Obama contends, and people are losing insurance plans they preferred and small businesses are chafing under the law's requirements. "That's why we must replace this fundamentally flawed law with patient-centered solutions that will actually lower health care costs and help create jobs," Steel said. Democrats on the stump, especially those who voted for it and now find themselves in tight races, have recalibrated their position with Obama's presidency not much help to them with voters overall in their states. But Obama said at the White House that the law is good for the country, regardless of politics, and that the numbers show Americans want it and that it's "here to stay." "I don't get it. Why are folks working so hard for people not to have health insurance? Why are they so mad about the idea of people having health insurance?" he asked. What people think Americans are divided over how they view the law. Last month, 46% said they viewed it unfavorably, down 4 points since January, and 38% said they viewed it favorably, up 4 points over the same time period, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll. Those who held unfavorable views cited concerns about costs (23%), opposition to the individual mandate (17%), and concerns about government intrusion (10%). Those with favorable views cited expanded access to health care and health insurance (61%), followed by the perception that it will control health care costs and make it more affordable (10%) and that it will be good for the country (7%). The telephone survey of 1,504 adults was conducted March 11 to 17 and had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 points. Professor Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, said he was not surprised at the last-minute rush to sign up. "I think the prayer of the conservatives that this would collapse just didn't get answered," he told CNN. "It fills a need." He predicted conservatives would chip away at whatever the number proves to be. "It's all just, some people hate Obama and anything he does," he said. The details The administration did not release details about the numbers, including the number of younger Americans who signed up. That metric is crucial for making the program work economically because premiums from younger, healthier participants are needed to make the program work for older people who use the health care system more. An official briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity said insurance companies were confident the percentage of young people was sufficient for the insurance marketplaces to function properly. Obamacare's primary goal is to reduce the ranks of the 45 million uninsured. Until now, many Americans with pre-existing conditions had to pay sky-high prices for insurance, if they could get any at all. Often, insurers branded them "uninsurable." The surge The administration pulled out all the stops in the final weeks of the enrollment period -- an effort one official equated to a "get out the vote" campaign before an election. Administration officials took to the radio airwaves by participating in 400 interviews, enlisted celebrities and athletes to promote the law, and engaged people on social media. And Obama's interview on the online comedycast "Between Two Ferns" resulted in the so-called Zach Galifianakis effect, resulting in 33 million views of his mock interview with the comedian. The interview with Galifianakis, along with a promotional push from Miami Heat forward LeBron James, were cited by administration officials as two of the most effective components in the push to enroll young Americans on the health care exchanges. The overall effort, the White House said, surpassed their expectations in terms of last-minute sign-ups.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/31/us/washington-landslide/index.html?eref=rss_mostpopular	us	Washington landslide death toll rises to 24 - CNN.com	2014/03/31	Monday Mar 31 06:44:26 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- The grim death toll from the massive landslide in rural Washington rose Monday to 24 people, and the discovery of three more bodies means the list of those confirmed killed likely will rise soon, authorities said. The Snohomish County Medical Examiner's Office released the names of 18 of the victims and said it is working to identify the other six people. Four-month-old Sanoah Huestis was the youngest of the 18 victims who were identified. The oldest was 71. The three bodies found Monday were discovered in the 640-acre debris field left after a massive landslide nine days ago, Snohomish County Executive Director Gary Haakenson said. They will not be added to the number of confirmed dead until they are identified and their families notified. Twenty-two people are now listed as missing, down from 30 earlier in the day, Haakenson said. At least 16 of the people on the unaccounted for list went missing on the same road. Also Monday, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee requested that President Barack Obama issue a major disaster declaration for the area. The governor asked for help with housing, funeral expenses and other disaster-related personal expenses, and unemployment insurance for those who lose their jobs as a result of the mudslide. "Words cannot describe the devastation done to the community of Oso and the impact the landslide continues to have in Darrington, Arlington and neighboring communities," Inslee said in a news release announcing the request. On March 22, a rain-saturated hillside along the north fork of the Stillaguamish River gave way, sending a square-mile rush of wet earth and rock into the outskirts of the town of Oso in Washington's North Cascade Mountains. Each day hundreds of searchers and dogs go through the muck looking for bodies, though some cling to hope someone might be found alive. Steve Harris, the supervisor for the search team on the eastern side of the slide, said that about four to six times per day, someone gets a "hit" on what may be a body or body part in the debris. He said identification is difficult and takes time. The slide was so powerful it crushed a lot of what was in its path. Cars were compacted to the size of a refrigerator, he said. He said the debris is 70 feet thick in some places, with an average of 30 feet over the disaster zone. Searchers are also looking at areas on the periphery to make sure nothing is overlooked, he said. "There's still a lot of work to do," Harris said. Monday's weather was kind to the search teams and allowed some areas to drain the water from recent rains. Workers are also using pumps 24 hours a day to remove water that has made the search difficult. Residents unite to help landslide victims  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/31/opinion/begala-obamacare-benefits/index.html?eref=rss_mostpopular	opinion	Begala: I got a better deal through Obamacare - CNN.com	2014/03/31	Monday Mar 31 08:23:55 EDT 2014	Editor's note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House. He is a consultant to the pro-Obama Super PAC, Priorities USA Action. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.  (CNN) -- I signed up for health care through the Affordable Care Act last week. I did so for one reason and one reason only: it was a good deal for my family. In fact, it was a better deal than we were getting before the ACA. The website, which received so much (well-deserved) negative publicity when it failed to launch, is now easy-peasy. The options it generated for us were more clearly delineated than those we'd been given in the past by a private-sector insurance broker. The benefits were plainly spelled out, as were the deductibles and co-pays. We are fortunate in that we do not need subsidies, and yet the Obama exchange still found us a better deal than we had found on our own. Let me be clear: this was not a political statement. This is my family's health. If I got the best care by going through Sarah Palin's website I would do so. Besides, the business decisions in our family are made by my wife, who has both an MBA and a Masters in Public Administration. I haven't had a checkbook since the Reagan administration, but because this decision was so personal and consequential, we made it as a team. In the end, it was not a tough choice. On the one hand, we got better coverage under the ACA. On the other, it cost less. I'm not exactly a believer in Republican talking points, but even I was surprised at how obviously superior my choices are under the new law. I knew there were no death panels, and I figured a plan originated by Newt Gingrich, the Heritage Foundation and Mitt Romney couldn't truly be Marxist. But I hadn't taken the time to do the math to figure whether the ACA would be a better deal for me. It is. The federal health exchange served me better than the private sector had. So I signed up. My doc is still my doc. My insurance company is still a private corporation - not (gasp!) a government agency. (Although I'd sign up for Medicare today if they'd let me; the government-run health insurance program for seniors is terrific.) Bottom line is, the ACA works, period. And here's the beauty part: even if you choose not to use the exchanges at all, you stand to benefit from the Affordable Care Act. If you or someone in your family has a pre-existing condition, you are a winner under the ACA. Ditto if, God forbid, you have an illness or an accident that would have maxed-out your pre-Obamacare coverage limit: the ACA outlaws coverage caps. If you're a young adult who can now be covered on your parent's plan till age 26, or a Medicare patient who needs preventive care or has fallen into the Donut Hole, you come out ahead too. Mitch McConnell: Another view on Obamacare All of those rights -- and more -- would disappear if the Republicans repealed the Affordable Care Act. The Republican-controlled House has voted 54 times to do just that. Despite spending millions on ads, the right is losing the debate. The latest Kaiser Family Fund poll shows that, even though the new health care law is still not popular, 59% of Americans want to keep the ACA as-is or modify it slightly. Only 18% want to repeal it altogether, and another 11% want to repeal it and replace it with a GOP alternative. As more and more Americans actually deal with health reform firsthand, as they actually receive new rights and new benefits, and as the parade of right-wing horribles fails to materialize, I suspect support for the ACA will continue to grow. As one of the millions of Americans who benefits from the ACA, I just want to say thanks, President Obama. And thank you, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid and everyone in Congress who voted for the Affordable Care Act. (Obviously, each person's individual situation is unique. It may well be that some folks will not share my positive experience. But you have nothing to lose by checking it out.) Thanks also to all the Republicans who voted for it. Wait, there weren't any. That's okay, I suppose. There were no Republicans who voted for the Clinton Economic Plan in 1993, and it led to balanced budgets and 23 million new jobs. The Republicans of that time predicted doom and depression if the Clinton Economic Plan passed. Their successors are predicting the same about the Affordable Care Act. And they're going to look just as foolish in the eyes of history. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/sport/football/football-world-cups-stickers/index.html	iSport	Brazil 2014: Got, Got, Need -- how stickers took the World Cup by storm - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 07:43:34 EDT 2014	Join the World Cup conversation at CNN Facebook Pulse (CNN) -- Obsession often brings joy and sorrow in equal measure. Inside that thin, shiny packet giving off a mystical glow sits five stickers -- five faces of five men whose very presence can turn lives upside down. Great @OfficialPanini haul yesterday! Shopkeep even chucked in a loose 20 he had! #gotgotneed pic.twitter.com/ySTbYERVcM Welcome to the world of World Cup sticker collecting. "My girlfriend gave me an ultimatum the other day, her or the football stickers? Shame really, I thought she was the one," Daniel Blazer, a British collector, told CNN. While most relationships survive the sticker phase, Blazer is not alone in his infatuation with the shiny adhesives which smile back at those dreaming of the holy grail -- the full sticker album. Some are relentless in their pursuit of that holy grail, setting up spreadsheets and even calling in their spouse to increase the odds of successful swapping. "My husband, Stephen, is obsessed with his sticker album," Emma Conway, who blogs under the name of brummymummyof2, told CNN. "He has his own spreadsheet so he knows what he needs and what he doesn't. It does get annoying. "Every time I go near a shop I have to get my three-year-old daughter some stickers and then get some for my 31-year-old husband. "He's a fantastic dad to our two children but I think the opportunity to collect stickers reminds him and his friends of being kids. "When I go to work, he gives me his swaps, and I swap them with my colleagues and then bring them back. "I'm like a drug dealer...but with stickers." Panini, the Italian company which creates the stickers, has been producing the iconic adhesives for the world's biggest football tournament since 1970. Based in Modena, but with subsidiaries across the globe, Panini can produce over 25 million packets of stickers a day -- that's over 750 million individual stickers. The company, which has a partnership with FIFA, the world's governing body, has exclusive rights to create products for the tournament. Sold in 100 countries worldwide, the phenomenon has become synonymous with the World Cup, which is held every four years. Insider peek at @figurinepanini @PaniniTurkiye @OfficialPanini production of #Wcstickers #gotgotneed pic.twitter.com/0QJvIN7eDy "I was very addicted when I was younger," Gabriel Perlaza, from Austin, Texas, told CNN, of his sticker obsession. "All we would do in recess was trade stickers. I'd also go downtown to the street vendors with my father or grandfather. They had drawers full of stickers and would sell them for different prices individually. "Looking back, it's just crazy how stickers would just take over and be all that mattered for those couple of months leading up to the World Cup. "Even now, at the age of 32, when I stop by the store and buy five packets, I can't wait to get home and open them up," added Perlaza. A quick glance at Twitter, Gumtree and other social media sites, provides a glimpse into the level of addiction that is currently gripping the world. The hashtag #gotgotneed -- named after the phrase "got, got need" -- is usually uttered during a sticker swapping session and it's now one of the most prevalent on Twitter. Be it on street corners or pubs and cafes, collectors trade at every opportunity, holding swapping sessions and allowing doubles to be discarded for the stickers which have so far proved elusive. Cesare Prandelli pos con su cromo de Panini pic.twitter.com/bgQYv7zkBP "I'm not at peace with myself if I can't get my hands on a Panini album before the World Cup," said Bernt-Erik Haaland, who lives in Norway. "It's a really important part of the whole experience, especially the 'getting ready' and build up part to the tournament. "It's also a really sociable thing to do because you can swap stickers with your friends." The internet has provided a whole new dimension to the World Cup sticker craze. Stickermanager.com is just one website which collectors can turn to in an effort to find each and every one of the 640 stickers. Created for the 2006 World Cup in Germany, it now boasts 140,000 registered members who swap stickers online with fellow collectors around the world. But swapping stickers in the post can be treacherous -- corners can get folded, faces can be blemished and your reputation can be ruined. Even within the safety of the home, keeping stickers in perfect condition can be hazardous. "We have a three-year-old girl and a one-year-old boy at home," Conway said. "My daughter loves the stickers and is always trying to peel them out of the book. "My husband is a very mild mannered man but if the kids go near the stickers then he'll raise his voice. He's very protective." Keeping your stickers in mint condition is crucial in maximizing your ability to swap. Today's #worldcup sticker packet - need any of these beauties? 1st person to tweet us with #gotgotneed wins them! pic.twitter.com/1UpvhQ5ch0 According to Stickermanager, the most popular sticker people are looking to collect is Jordi Alba, the Spain and Barcelona defender along with the German national logo in all its shiny glory. But forget about swapping Gianluigi Buffon -- everybody appears to have the Juventus and Italian goalkeeper in their collection. Every collector has a nemesis -- just ask Phil Smith, an avid collector from Sunderland. He is starting to feel he is being stalked by Cameroon's Alex Song. "Song has swiftly become the scourge of my existence," said Smith. "Collecting stickers was an attempt to try and reconnect with my childhood and an innocent love of the game. "Alex has totally sucked the whole fun out of the whole process, though. I have five of him now, and there appears to be no end in sight "The prospect of swapping him for someone exotic or essential to my collection is long gone. His five faces are destined to sit on top of my record player for eternity, symbolically gathering dust. "For many, 2014 will be the summer of Samba, football, flair and joy. For me, it will be the summer of Alex Song." One man took his love for stickers to a whole new level. Adam Caroll-Smith, a Portsmouth fan, stumbled upon his 1996 Premier League sticker album in 2012 and was left devastated to find he was still missing six players. The 29-year-old, who chronicles his quest to complete his collection in his book, "Six Stickers: A journey to complete an old sticker album", traveled far and wide to meet the players who he had failed to find in those hundreds of packets. His journey proved successful, meeting the six former Premier League footballers and completing the book, before tossing the album into the sea in an act he describes as "cathartic." "At the time, I was coming up to 30, getting married, having a child and it felt like a natural point to take stock of my life," Carroll-Smith told CNN. "I think for a lot of people, that plays a part in the obsession. It allows them the opportunity to wallow in the excitement of their childhood. "I think stickers are a metaphor for that -- they are something with a beautiful simplicity. "When you're a kid, it's a chance to flash your football allegiance and gives you tangible proof to show how into football you are. "Now, it gives a bizarre and nostalgic feel. I guess it's because it's something rooted in a particular era and has a timeless quality about it." Such is the universal appeal of the product that Panini says in total it will sell 239,000 km of stickers - enough to stretch into space. "Panini has the ability to create nostalgia galore amongst our 'second generation' collectors," Jessica Tadmor, head of marketing at Panini UK, told CNN. "The media plays a large part. We've had radio DJ's collecting live on air, TV programs featuring the collection, and Twitter going sticker crazy. "There have even been secret midnight swapping conventions in London aided by a beer or two." 100 sobres y no me encontr #BadLuckCampbell pic.twitter.com/Mwj5MhSkJV Even the players are at it -- Costa Rica striker Joel Campbell, who was so desperate to find a sticker of himself that he bought a hundred packets. But after opening each packet, he was left seething after failing to collect his own picture -- unlike his Costa Rica teammate, Bryan Ruiz. Que difcil imitar la cara de concentracin antes de un partido!! #lbumpanini La postal que me sali hoy  pic.twitter.com/iXh8OLs431 The craze is set to continue when the tournament kicks off in Sao Paulo on June 12 with Brazil hosting Croatia in the opening fixture. Conway is already resigned to losing the attention of her husband, Stephen, for the duration of the tournament -- even if he's finished his sticker album by then. "I won't exist once it all starts," she jokes. "We've been together 10 years so I know exactly what to expect and I'm sure he'll try to get the kids watching with him. "His brother is going to Brazil so he's got a bit of envy but he'll be watching all the games. "And he'll be making sure the kids don't go anywhere near the stickers too!"  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/business/varosha-famagusta-one-square-meter/index.html	iBUSINESS	Can eco-city plans bring Cypriot ghost town back to life? - CNN.com	2014/05/27	Tuesday May 27 11:42:40 EDT 2014	One Square Meter explores the leading architectural designs, city plans and demand for property investment in emerging markets. Join CNN's John Defterios as he visits some of the world's most dynamic cities for an insight into the fast-paced world of real estate development. (CNN) -- In 1974 the Mediterranean island of Cyprus was divided in two. A coup backed by the Greek government was met with a Turkish military invasion, partitioning the country between the Turkish-Cypriot north and Greek-Cypriot south. One of the most enduring symbols of the divide remains the resort of Varosha, an abandoned district of the ancient city of Famagusta that has come to act as a no-man's-land between north and south. Controlled by the Turkish military, the area's glistening beaches and apartment blocks remain off-limits to non-military personnel. At its peak, Varosha had 25,000 residents and 12,000 hotel rooms, attracting guests from across Europe and the Middle East. Today, all lie empty and in a state of disrepair. "It was one of the centers of tourism of the Mediterranean Sea," laments Oktay Kaylap, the Turkish Cypriot mayor of Famagusta. "It used to be very palatial but now it's for neither Greek nor Turkish Cypriots." A group of Famagusta residents and Varosha citizens in exile hope to change that. New York based film-maker, Vasia Markides, whose Greek-Cypriot mother was forced to leave Varosha, has founded the Famagusta eco-city project -- a grass roots movement led by citizens from both communities. Their goal is to rebuild the city and transform the resort-town into a cultural, economic and environmental hub that can generate its own energy from renewable sources and grow its own food. Although the idea is still in the embryonic stages, Markides has been encouraged by the early response from both Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Greek Cypriot mayor, Alexis Galanos, and Turkish Cypriot mayor, Oktay Kaylap -- who both have equal standing and recognize each other's positions -- pledged to work together towards a future Famagusta metropolis and to form a joint committee to that effect in December last year. CNN tried to contact Alexis Galanos for interview on the Varosha project but he was unavailable. Markides even ventures that the regeneration plans could help get the local economy moving again after the difficulties of recent years. "Because of the economic crisis people were found in a very desperate, difficult situation and now I think more than ever they are willing to compromise and let go of the past in order to build the future together," Markides said. "The eco-city would actually be a really good economic boost for the island because it will bring in a new kind of tourism, high value tourism (and) eco-tourism which didn't exist 40 years ago," she added. So far, a number of willing technical experts have been recruited to the Varosha revival cause. Professor Jan Wampler is a recognized specialist in sustainable architecture. He and graduate students from the University of South Florida have completed design "phase one" for the eco-city. "I am very optimistic," Wampler said. "Something has to be done. In this world you can't have so called ghost cities sitting there for 40 years just completely vacant." "In this case we have a golden opportunity. In fact I consider it to be the perfect prototype for what the world might follow in the future," Wampler added. Energy expert George Lordos, echoed this enthusiasm. "Famagusta will be the first thing that happens on the ground if there is a comprehensive settlement (between Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot communities)," Lordos said. "The principles of peace, sustainability and permaculture, these are the main principles of the eco-city project," he added. For now, Varosha remains sectioned-off from the outside world by armed guards and miles of wire fences. But Lordos is confident a solution to the decade's long stand-off can be found -- an opinion shared by Cypriot president, Nicos Anastasiades, who said Cyprus' new deep-sea energy resources could help unite the island when talking to CNN last month. "If and when that happens we need to be able to take advantage of redeveloping Varosha as a sustainable destination for tourism," Lordos said. Famagusta and former residents of Varosha stand ready to act. Read more: Will Hollywood stars move downtown? Read more: Forest in the sky to transform Milan Read more: World's best skyscraper is...  
http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/12/business/looking-for-an-emerging-market-airline-routes/index.html	iBUSINESS	How new airline routes are reshaping the world - CNN.com	2013/11/12	Tuesday Nov 12 10:38:23 EST 2013	(CNN) -- Perhaps nothing illustrates the ambitions of the well-established Gulf carriers -- Emirates, Etihad and Qatar -- and Turkish Airlines so much as the swift expansion of their route networks. Turkish Airlines currently flies to about 190 destinations, and plans to add another 60 to its network in the next five years. Emirates, meanwhile, is rumored to have placed a record-breaking order for Boeing's 777X aircraft. "These carriers have a good modern fleet and can fly long distances, and because of their geographical position, they can connect anywhere from their hub to almost anywhere else in the world, either non-stop, or one-stop," says John Strickland, an independent transport consultant. When it comes to choosing what routes to launch, it happens that the region's major carriers have a carefully calculated strategy that can speak volumes about emerging markets. Slideshow: How drones will change your life Breaking up America? Traditionally, the United States has been overlooked in favor of the European market by the Gulf carriers and Turkish. All that's changing as Etihad, Emirates, Qatar and Turkish Airlines all either introduced direct routes to the States last year, or else have some in the works for 2014. "They're really starting to shake up the U.S. market for the first time," says Brendan Sobie, a spokesperson for the Center for Aviation. Last year, Dubai launched a direct flight from New York City to Milan -- the first time in the airline's history a flight bypassed the Dubai hub (last year, Delta and Alitalia unsuccessfully sued the Italian government to block the Emirates route). In the next 15 years, the airline plans to double the number of U.S. destinations it flies into. Etihad will fly to four U.S. cities by the end of 2014, while Qatar Airways will be up to six. The expansion has not gone unnoticed by the American aviation industry. The U.S. trade group Airlines for America and the U.S. pilot union, Air Line Pilots Association International, have been the most ardent opponents of the Gulf carriers encroachment into the U.S. market, often joining Delta and United in lobbying Congress for protectionist policies. "It is interesting to see how the U.S. carriers and politicians are starting to respond," says Sobie. Read more: Why the Dubai Airshow is a gamechanger Tapping Africa In just a couple of years, Turkish Airlines has become the largest international carrier in Africa, flying into 39 destinations. At first glance, some of the African cities in their network might seem random -- why fly to Somalia? Their business plan underlines investment strategies for Turkey as a whole. According to the Center for Aviation many of the countries they serve, or are planning to serve, have a rapidly growing economy. In 2012, Rwanda's GDP grew by 8%, and Nigeria's by 6.6%. The continent also houses a wealth of natural resources. "The most important geographic part of the world over the next 100 years will be Africa. In this respect, any destination (we fly to) in Africa will create more effective results than, say, a destination in Europe," says Ali Genc, Turkish Airlines' senior vice president of media relations. Quiz time: Test your aviation knowledge Building BRICs Turkish Airlines and the Gulf carriers have been increasingly developing their network across Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRICs) -- the nations widely viewed as the most promising developing markets in the 21st century. The importance of developing these routes is not simply to connect these emerging markets with the Middle East, but with each other. "Carriers like Emirates, Etihad and Qatar can access emerging markets in Africa, Asia and Latin America and connect them in a way that is meaningful to travelers, and that European carriers can't hope to copy," says Strickland. Budget carriers like Air Arabia and flydubai have become particularly attractive to cities and towns across Central and Eastern Europe. "Regionally, we're seeing a lot of interest in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)," says Sobie. "Air Arabia and flydubai is a good fit for the medium-haul, thinner routes that are high-yielding and growing, but can't support the widebody aircraft of Emirates," he adds.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/tech/web/skype-translator/index.html	tech	Skype Translator to break the Web-chat language barrier - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 12:59:11 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- Skype users soon will be able to expand the list of people they can connect with, says Microsoft, owner of the popular Web-chat tool. Still in its early stages of development, Skype Translator, as it's being called for now, will provide voice and text language translation for calls between people speaking different languages. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Gurdeep Pall, the vice president in charge of Skype, demonstrated the technology Tuesday night in California at the Code Conference, sponsored by tech-news site Re/Code. "It is going to make sure you can communicate with anybody without language barriers," Nadella said at the gathering in suburban Los Angeles. "In fact, it's the most human of things." At the demo, Pall, speaking English, and a colleague speaking German conducted a Skype video call. There were a couple of instances when the voice and text translation mixed up minor parts of a sentence, but overall it appeared to be spot on. The conversation was no simple "Hello, how are you?" either. It centered on Pall's plans to move to London and included the names of streets and neighborhoods in that city as well as discussion of his colleague's visits to Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. The two would speak, then wait while the program translated what was just said. "It is early days for this technology, but the 'Star Trek' vision for a Universal Translator isn't a galaxy away, and its potential is every bit as exciting as those 'Star Trek' examples," Pall said in a blog post. "Skype Translator opens up so many possibilities to make meaningful connections in ways you never could before in education, diplomacy, multilingual families and in business." After a short delay, the system posts one user's translated comments as text onscreen to the other user while a synthetic voice speaks them aloud. Pall said Skype Translator will be available first as a Windows 8 beta app by the end of this year. Microsoft purchased London-based Skype, which has 300 million monthly users, in 2011. But Nadella said the translation technology the program uses has been in development at Microsoft for 15 years. And, in another development straight out of science fiction, he said the current version is surprising even its creators. "Say you teach it English. It learns English," he said. "Then you teach it Mandarin. It learns Mandarin, but it becomes better at English. And then you teach it Spanish. It gets good at Spanish, but it gets great at both Mandarin and English -- and, quite frankly, none of us know exactly why. "It's brain-like in the sense of its capability to learn. It's magical."  
http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/06/world/europe/european-union-fast-facts/index.html	world	European Union Fast Facts - CNN.com	2013/06/06	Thursday Jun 6 02:51:11 EDT 2013	(CNN) -- Here is a look at what you need to know about the European Union. About the European Union: 
The European Union is an international organization made up of 28 European countries. It governs common economic, social and security policies of its member states. According the EU website, the objectives of the EU are to establish European citizenship, ensure freedom, justice and security, promote economic and social progress, and assert Europe's role in the world. Membership is open to any country with a democratic government, a good human rights record, and sound economic policies. The member states delegate sovereignty to the EU institutions to represent the interests of the European Union as a whole. Decisions and procedures stem from treaties ratified by the member states. The capital of the European Union is Brussels, Belgium. The EU is run by five main bodies: European Parliament, Council of the Union, European Commission, Court of Justice, and the Court of Auditors. The European Union is a major economic unit. The combined population of member countries is 57% larger than that of the United States. The United States is the EU's main trading partner. The Treaty of Lisbon amends the Treaty on European Union to explicitly recognize for the first time the Member States' right to withdraw from the union. (Article 50, amended TEU) 
- Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements. 
- A Member State which decides to withdraw shall notify the European Council of its intention. In the light of the guidelines provided by the European Council, the Union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union. Timeline:

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/07/tech/incredible-new-tech-inspired-by-biology/index.html	tech	Incredible new tech inspired by biology - CNN.com	2014/05/07	Wednesday May 7 11:25:57 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- When the body comes under attack by flu, dendritic cells rush to the site of infection and identify the alien forms attacking it. Millions raise the alarm and the immune system is fired into action. It is a reliable and effective response, and what is good enough to protect our health has also proved capable of safeguarding inboxes. Artificial immune systems (AIS) based on the body's cellular response to disease are being used to target spam. 'It's an adaptive system that can be more nuanced in detecting what's dangerous", says Dr. Uwe Aickelin, professor of computer science at the university of Nottingham and leading AIS developer. "Millions of pieces of information are gathered so the cells are very accurate." While the cells in our bodies will respond to signals such as stress and inflammation, Aickelin's software analogue picks up on the traffic bombardments associated with spam. While generic filters can cope with conventional phishing, the cellular system is suited to a user facing frequent new threats, and has been employed by leading security companies. This model represents a potentially transformative shift in the rapidly expanding field of biomimicry. The trend for nature-inspired designs has spread across industries from crab-style deep-sea vessels to insect-inspired buildings, and is projected to generate $1.6 trillion by 2030 according to Da Vinci Index. But now technologies based specifically on cellular designs are making nature itself the driving force. In addition to computing, cellular biomimicry is making its mark in water filtration, meeting President Nixon's historic challenge to make the oceans drinkable, using a membrane present in humans and plants. Meanwhile, photosynthetic processes are being applied to the capture and storage of solar energy, while millions of dollars have been invested in applying the properties of lung cells to building exteriors -- the 'Eskin' - to create a layer that allows them to interact efficiently with both people and the environment. "It represents a shift and ultimately where we are heading", Janine Benyus, biologist, author and founder of Biomimcry 3.8 told CNN. "We have become very successful in mimicking form, but the real transformational change comes in how we build our material world. Every day we are learning more about molecular machinery in cells and how they work so as to understand and use their design principles is key. These principles are being applied to some of the most critical resource issues, including fuel through the development of biobatteries. Researchers at the University of Utah have created a battery based on the process of metabolism, using sugar as fuel, catalyzed with the natural energy conversion properties of enzymes. "If you see a small child consume sugar they convert it to run around all day, so it's very efficient and we take the same pathways to apply to the battery", says lead developer Shelley Minteer, who claims the design has favorable performance qualities. The biobattery can already operate devices such as smartphones, and may prove more versatile than traditional batteries as it can function in extremely low temperatures. The technology is proved to the extent that offshoot company Akermin has received a $3 million grant to use the technology in one of the US' largest carbon cleaning operations in power plants. The combination of living process and synthetic materials is rarely seamless, Minteer admits. Yet advances in the technology of modeling are now allowing greater control and accuracy. Scientists can sculpt the synthesized cells at nano scale into ever more efficient arrangements, getting closer to the natural design. Visualization tools are being driven by creative fields, notably architecture, while manufacturing is improving rapidly through 3D printing. There are skeptics that believe natural processes are being too readily applied. "Natural systems evolved for very specific reasons, over millions of years, with very specific parameters, scale-lengths, forces, and the process of translating these phenomena to other scales, function and human desires does not come naturally or directly.", Skylar Tibbits, lead researcher at MIT's self-assembly lab, argued in a 2013 TED talk. "We should not simply assume that systems working at nanoscales can easily be translated to large scales." Critics have also warned of 'Jurassic Park' unpredictable and unwanted side effects when natural process are transplanted into technology. Such effects have been noted in Uwe Ackelein's anti-spam program, where the target adapts the defense as well as vice versa. But these risks pale compared to the potential benefits, exponents believe. Using the processes of nature can deliver designs uniquely adaptive to the environment, with better function and resource management, that can transform industries to deliver solutions to the most critical questions of the age.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/travel/qatar-kuwait-skimpy-clothing-bans/index.html	travel	Bikinis and skimpy clothing targeted in Gulf cover-up campaigns - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 12:08:04 EDT 2014	(CNN) -- The flashing of flesh in several Gulf states may just have got a little harder after efforts were launched to ban bikinis and get visitors to cover up. In Qatar, a campaign using posters and social media is encouraging expats to wear modest clothing in public, while in Kuwait, lawmakers have reportedly called for some swimwear to be outlawed. Brochures distributed by the "Reflect Your Respect" campaign tell expats: "If you're in Qatar you're one of us. Help us preserve Qatar's culture and values, please dress modestly in public places by covering from shoulders to knees." Posters identify as inappropriate sleeveless dresses, exposed midriffs, tank tops on men and women and skirts or shorts above the knee. MORE: 'Bikini ban' slated for Spanish island Women are notified that "leggings are not pants." The campaign has taken to Twitter and Instagram to drive home its message and also reportedly intends to dispatch female volunteers to hand out leaflets in public. The campaign's organizers were not immediately available for comment. Breach of morality Clothing advice is nothing new in Qatar. Its tourism authority advises on its website that "men and women should dress modestly as a courtesy to both Qataris and Muslims... Tops should cover the shoulders and upper arms, and skirts or shorts should fall to or below the knee." The new campaign points out that anyone residing or visiting the country is subjected to Qatari laws that are widely considered to prohibit immodest attire as a breach of morality. Most Qataris dress conservatively according to Islamic custom. Women wear flowing black robes called abayas while men wear white robes called thawbs. However, Qataris account for a small proportion of the population -- approximately 85% of the country's two million residents are expats. Attempts to implement a strict dress code could impact on visitors as Qatar gears up to host the 2022 World Cup. MORE: 10 outrageous spas in the Middle East Reaction on social media was mixed. "Appreciate the dress code campaign by @reflect_respect as being done respectfully and tastefully and for both genders," said a tweet by Fadi El Hage "Respect is through actions not what you wear," tweeted Sindhu Nair. Bathers targeted Motte Christian's reaction was more tongue-in-cheek, tweeting "I'm looking forward to see footballer wearing pants during football world cup 2022." All the Gulf countries, which are socially conservative and have large expatriate populations, advise foreigners to dress modestly although it is rarely enshrined in law. Saudi Arabia is the only Arab country that requires women to wear abayas and cover their hair in public. Last year the United Arab Emirates witnessed a similar social media campaign to encourage visitors to dress modestly. Meanwhile, in Kuwait, officials are reportedly seeking to target bathers. A committee dealing with "tackling bad social behavior" has approved a proposal to ban "nudity" of women at all swimming pools, public places and in hotels, according to the English-language Kuwait Times. Hamdan Al-Azemi, an Islamist lawmaker who heads the committee, did not specify what was meant by "nudity" but the newspaper reports that the term includes wearing bikinis and "revealing or improper dress." The proposal needs to be approved by parliament and ratified by the Kuwaiti government before being enshrined into law.  
http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/30/us/hurricane-season-fast-facts/index.html	us	Hurricane Season Fast Facts - CNN.com	2013/05/30	Thursday May 30 12:38:51 EDT 2013	(CNN) -- Here's a look at what you need to know about the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30. Facts: 
The National Weather Service defines a hurricane as "an intense tropical weather system with well-defined circulation and sustained winds of 74mph (64 knots) or higher." The peak of the season is from mid-August to late October. In the western Northern Pacific, hurricanes are called typhoons. Similar storms in the Indian Ocean are called cyclones. Hurricanes are rated according to intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. The 1-5 scale estimates potential property damage. A Category 3 or higher is considered a major hurricane. A hurricane watch indicates the possibility that a region could experience hurricane conditions within 48 hours. A hurricane warning indicates that tropical-storm-force winds of at least 74 mph are expected within 36 hours. Hurricane Development: 
There are three stages of development: tropical depression to tropical storm to hurricane. Tropical depression - when a cluster of thunderstorms organizes under the right atmospheric conditions for a long enough time, with maximum sustained winds of 38 mph (33 knots) or lower. Tropical storm - a tropical depression that has intensified to the point where its maximum sustained winds are between 39-73 mph (34-63 knots). During this time, the storm itself becomes more organized and begins to become more circular in shape -- resembling a hurricane. This is when the storm is named. Hurricane - develops from a tropical storm as surface pressures continue to drop, and sustained wind speeds reach 74 mph (64 knots) or higher, with a pronounced rotation developing around the central core. Hurricane Categories: 
From National Hurricane Center/NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is a 1-5 rating based on the hurricane's present intensity. It estimates potential property damage. Sustained wind speed is the determining factor in the scale. Category One Hurricane  
Winds 74-95 mph (64-82 kt or 119-153 km/hr). No real damage to building structures. Damage primarily to unanchored mobile homes, shrubbery, and trees. Some damage to poorly constructed signs and coastal road flooding with minor pier damage. Damage to power lines and poles could result in power outages lasting several days. Category Two Hurricane 
Winds 96-110 mph (83-95 kt or 154-177 km/hr). Some roofing material, door, and window damage of buildings. Considerable damage to shrubbery and trees with some trees blown down. Considerable damage to mobile homes, poorly constructed signs, and piers. Small craft in unprotected anchorages break moorings. Power outages could last from several days to weeks. Category Three Hurricane 
Winds 111-129 mph (96-112 kt or 178-208 km/hr). Some structural damage to small residences and utility buildings with a minor amount of curtainwall failures. Many large trees will be uprooted and blown down, blocking roads. Mobile homes and poorly constructed signs are destroyed. Evacuation of low-lying residences within several blocks of the shoreline may be required. Electricity and water will be unavailable for several days to weeks. Category Four Hurricane 
Winds 130-156 mph (113-136 kt or 209-251 km/hr). More extensive curtainwall failures with some complete roof structure failures on small residences. Shrubs, trees, and all signs are blown down. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Extensive damage to doors and windows. Power outages will last from weeks to possibly months, with most of the area also being uninhabitable for weeks or months. Category Five Hurricane 
Winds greater than 157 mph (137 kt or 252 km/hr). Complete roof failure on many residences and industrial buildings. Some complete building failures with small utility buildings blown over or away. All shrubs, trees, and signs blown down. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Severe and extensive window and door damage. Massive evacuation of residential areas on low ground within 5-10 miles (8-16 km) of the shoreline may be required. Power outages will last from weeks to possibly months, with most of the area also being uninhabitable for weeks or months. Names: 
Once a storm system with counter-clockwise circulation and sustained wind speeds of 39 mph or greater is identified by the National Hurricane Center in Miami, a name from the list is assigned to the storm. There are nine regional lists of names: Atlantic, Eastern North Pacific, Central North Pacific, Western North Pacific Ocean/South China Sea, Australian Region, Port Moresby/Papua New Guinea, Fiji Region, Southwest Indian Ocean and North Indian Ocean. Using women's names became the practice during World War II, following the use of a woman's name for a storm in the 1941 novel "Storm" by George R. Stewart. In 1979, the list of hurricane names for the Atlantic regions began to include male names. Six separate name lists are developed and agreed upon by the World Meteorological Organization. The lists are rotated every six years. Names associated with storms that have caused significant death and/or damage are retired from the list. Camille (1969), Andrew (1992), Opal (1995), Floyd (1999), Ivan (2004), Katrina (2005), Ike (2008) and Sandy (2012) have all been retired from the list. Once a name is removed, another name replaces it.

http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/06/us/performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sports-fast-facts/index.html	us	Performance Enhancing Drugs in Sports Fast Facts - CNN.com	2013/06/06	Thursday Jun 6 02:00:32 EDT 2013	(CNN) -- Here's a look at performance enhancing drugs in sports. Facts: 
The use of performance-enhancing drugs by professional athletes, or "doping", has been acknowledged as a problem since at least the 1960s. The issue has gained prominence in the last ten years as a result of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (BALCO) investigation, tell-alls by former professional athletes and the Mitchell investigation into drugs in professional baseball. About Performance-Enhancing Drugs: 
There are several types of performance-enhancing drugs: anabolic steroids, stimulants, human growth hormone and supplements. Anabolic steroids are synthetic substances that stimulate proteins that help build non-fat muscle mass, helping an athlete become stronger and able to train and play for longer periods of time. Tetrahydrogestrinone, also called "THG" or "The Clear," is the type of steroid purportedly used by many high-profile athletes, including track star Marion Jones and baseball player Barry Bonds. Stimulants help boost an athlete's energy level, helpful after strenuous training. Amphetamines are a type of stimulant. Human growth hormone (HGH), is available only by prescription and is administered by injection. Athletes take it for improved endurance and strength although there is no definitive proof that it boosts athletic performance. Androstenedione, known as "andro," was formerly an over the counter supplement but was banned by the NFL, Olympics, NCAA and later the MLB. It helps the body process testosterone. Timeline:

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/sport/football/javier-hernandez-mexico-world-cup/index.html	iSport	Javier Hernandez: Mexico out to make World Cup history - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 10:25:03 EDT 2014	Join the World Cup conversation at CNN Facebook Pulse (CNN) -- Mexico is not heading to Brazil simply to make up the numbers -- it's looking to go all the way. That is the belief of Javier Hernandez, who has his eyes firmly fixed on leading his side all the way to the World Cup final. El Tri face a challenge to get out of a tricky group, which also features Cameroon and Croatia in addition to host and tournament favorite, Brazil. But Hernandez insists a nation which has never gone further than the quarterfinal stage in the past can make history this time around. "Our mind is on the final, really," he told CNN. "I think every national team has the same possibilities to win the World Cup. "It's a very short competition and anything could happen, so our goal is to get into the final and to try to win it. "There's no point going to a competition and just thinking: 'We're just going to play three games.' That's not the point if you want to make history." The striker will take heart from his side's performance at the 2010 World Cup after it progressed from a group which included France, Uruguay and host nation, South Africa. The 25-year-old scored twice in the tournament before Mexico eventually crashed out to Argentina with a 3-1 defeat in the second round. Should El Tri get that far this time around it could come up against reigning champion Spain or 2010 runner-up Netherlands in the last 16. Hernandez, though, says the big boys of the tournament hold no fear for a nation competing at their sixth straight World Cup. "If you want to win the World Cup you need to play against the best national teams in the world. We know that if we have a very good group stage and get through, obviously the teams that we could face in the next match are going to be very difficult," he said. "But there's no easy national team really -- you need to play against the best." Mexico's most impressive World Cup campaigns to date came in 1970 and 1986, where they made the quarterfinal stage as the tournament's hosts on both occasions. And Hernandez feels that with Brazil sharing similar conditions to his country of birth, El Tri have a better chance than many this summer. "It's normal and it's logical that Mexico are going to find it a little bit easier because of the way the weather in Brazil," he added. "It's quite similar to our country, and obviously for countries like England or other European countries which are colder or have a different type of weather, it's going to be a little more difficult for them." Hernandez joined Manchester United in 2010 after impressing as a youngster at local Mexican side Club Deportivo Guadalajara, where he came through the youth ranks. Despite enjoying initial success at Old Trafford, he found life tough under manager David Moyes last season and was limited to just six Premier League starts. But Hernandez, who has racked up 58 caps for Mexico since making his international debut in 2009, is determined to put a frustrating campaign behind him and get back to his best in Brazil. "It was a very difficult year for me especially because I couldn't play and I couldn't help my team," he said. "But my head now is 100% on the national team. I'm very focused and very concentrated on this World Cup. "I want to do my best, to give my best to my teammates and to the coaching staff. Like I told you, [I want] to try and make history in this World Cup." Hernandez was reticent about his future at United and refused to talk about it while on international duty. But when asked to comment, he said: "I think there is going to be time after [the World Cup] that I am going to speak about that."

http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/14/sport/football/brazil-confederations-cup-neymar-pele-football/index.html	iSport	Soccer stars haunted by 'Brazil's Hiroshima' - CNN.com	2013/06/14	Friday Jun 14 09:17:40 EDT 2013	Editor's note: Ready to Play debuts on CNN International on July 26 at 1530 GMT. (CNN) -- Rio de Janeiro's Maracana Stadium was packed to the rafters: 200,000 expectant spectators prepared to celebrate Brazil's first World Cup triumph and its arrival as a football superpower. It was the moment the South American country's love of the game, and of its most prestigious competition, became a dangerous obsession. July 16, 1950, the final match of the final group stage. Brazil faced Uruguay, and a draw would be enough to see the host crowned as champion. The champagne was put on ice when winger Friaca gave Brazil a 1-0 lead just after halftime. But the samba beat was silenced when Juan Alberto Schiaffino equalized for Uruguay -- and then the unthinkable happened. World Sport Presents: Racism in Football Uruguay came forward, Brazil goalkeeper Barbosa stepped off his line, Alcides Ghiggia scuffed a low shot towards the near post ... and the ball nestled in the back of the net. Brazil had lost. A nation's hearts were broken. Lives were forever altered and a national obsession was born. The 63 years since have seen Brazil become football's dominant force. The five World Cups won by "A Selecao" is more than any other country in the quadrennial competition's 83-year history. But not one of Brazil's quintet of triumphs has banished the shadow cast by the failure of Moacyr Barbosa Nascimento and his teammates. "The idea the rest of the world has about Brazil, and perhaps Brazil has about itself to a certain extent, is that it is all about 'joga bonito,' it is all about the beautiful game," says Jonathan Wilson, journalist and author of "The Outsider: A history of the goalkeeper." Read: German football embraces Israel "Actually it is all about winning in Brazil, far more than anywhere else despite the perception," he told CNN. "There's no such thing as heroic failure in Brazil. "Barbosa was named goalkeeper of the tournament, but he was scapegoated in Brazil because of what happened in the final game. "He didn't get picked for the next couple of years. He was a very good goalkeeper, but all he is remembered for is that one mistake." The error which led to Uruguay's second goal hung over Barbosa until his death in 2000. But the saddest moment of his life, he said, was not in the final or its immediate aftermath. Read: Year Zero in football's racism fight? Some 20 years later, a woman in a supermarket pointed towards him and declared to the young boy by her side, "Look at him, son. He is the man that made all of Brazil cry." "Under Brazilian law the maximum sentence is 30 years," Barbosa remarked on his 79th birthday, just two weeks before he passed away. "But my imprisonment has been for 50 years." The disappointment looms large in Brazil's national psyche, and all the more so with the country to host the World Cup again next year for the first time since that fateful day. "Nelson Rodriguez, the playwright, spoke about 'Our Hiroshima," Wilson said. "It seems monstrously disproportionate and it is, but I think what he means is that it's Brazil's national disaster. Read: Mourinho the "Stable One"? "They've never been in a war, they've never really had a great disaster. They just expected to win. The newspapers on the morning of the game were saying 'Brazil World Champions.' " The newspapers were wrong. It is this weight which the present day team must carry as it prepares to host the Confederations Cup, a warmup event for the World Cup, which Brazil kicks off against Japan on Saturday. Once again the World Cup is coming to Brazil and once again a nation expects. "Everybody knows the bad experiences we had in the World Cup in Brazil in the '50s -- we lost, but now we have to recover," says Pele, one of football's greatest players and a triple World Cup winner with Brazil between 1958 and 1970. Barbosa's tale is a cautionary one for the current Brazil squad. A mistake by any player next year could be the costliest they ever make. Luiz Felipe Scolari, coach of the last Brazil team to lift the World Cup in 2002, was reinstated in November 2012 to inspire a floundering team. The results have been unspectacular. Scolari has won two, drawn four and lost one of his seven matches back at the helm and the team languishes in 22nd in the FIFA world rankings. A 2-2 draw with England in June was the first match at the refurbished Maracana, a stadium which is both a monument to Brazil's sporting prowess and a mausoleum for past failure. "We always have good players, but we don't have a good team right now," Carlos Alberto, captain of Brazil's World Cup winners of 1970, told CNN. "We don't have experience, the players are very young. "Everybody says to these players, 'You have to win, you have to win.' It's not good because they are young, they don't have the experience to play an international tournament." That 1970 team is often referred to as the greatest of all time, given the style and swagger with which it crushed Italy 4-1 in the final match of the Mexico tournament. The advent of color television made the players, bedecked in iconic vibrant yellow with green trim, appear as if soccer stars from another planet. Alberto does not think the current generation is yet capable of emulating his team's achievements, but he is backing his countrymen to succeed four years later. "They are going to take the experience of playing in the World Cup next year into 2018. In Russia, I bet you any money Brazil will win!" he declared. "Next year, if they get to the semifinals it is OK." Edu, a midfielder capped 15 times for Brazil between 2004 and 2005, shares Alberto's reservations. The former Arsenal player is concerned a change of management has disrupted a squad short on international experience. "We're not prepared yet," Edu, now director of football at Club World Cup winners Corinthians, told CNN. "We've changed the coach, which is not normal. "Usually a coach has four, five, six years to get used to his team. Scolari is lucky, because Brazil has a lot of players to build a good squad. But I'm not sure if they will be prepared enough for the World Cup. "The Brazilian team is not in the best moment." One player of whom a huge amount is expected is Neymar, a flamboyant attacker recently signed by Barcelona who is frequently hailed as "the new Pele." If Brazil is to finally win the World Cup on home soil, the fleet-footed, shock-haired attacker will have to prove he has shoulders broad enough to carry a nation's hopes. "Listen, winning the World Cup is very hard because it is a box of surprises. No doubt Brazil is one of the best, but this doesn't mean Brazil is going to win ... The best players in Europe, they are Brazilian," Pele told CNN. "In Brazil we have had a lot of excellent players like Zico, Tostao, Rivelino, Pele, Ronaldinho, but the last two years we have had Neymar. "He is very talented. I hope he has luck in Barcelona. I didn't like it so much because he used to play in my team, Santos, I lost a good player. He deserves to go to the best team. "I said to be the new Pele would be very difficult, because my mother and my father, they closed the machine (gestures). But no doubt he is one of the best players who we have in Brazil."  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/world/africa/egypt-presidential-election/index.html	world	Polls close amid low turnout in Egypt presidential vote - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 03:04:48 EDT 2014	Egyptians, do you plan to vote in the presidential election? Tell us why or why not. (CNN) -- Polls finally closed in Egypt's presidential election Wednesday, and workers have started to count the ballots, according to Egyptian state media. An extra day of voting was added to boost turnout, but it may have done little, according to CNN crews who witnessed no lines at polling places throughout Cairo. The election, initially scheduled for Monday and Tuesday, pit former army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi against Hamdeen Sabahy. The election commission extended the voting saying people living far from where they are registered need to return to vote, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported. No numbers have been released, but the move came after TV hosts had openly criticized voters for not participating. Both Candidates had criticized the extra day of voting and had filed complaints. "We strongly denounce the (election commission's) decision to extend voting another day. Extending the voting period for no real plausible reason will open the door to possible vote violations and rigging," said Hussein Abdel Ghany, a top adviser to Sabahy. Sabahy's campaign announced Wednesday that it's withdrawing its delegates who observe the polls because they have been arrested or assaulted: "In the past 48 hours we were subjected to a wide range of abuses, assaults and violations. These include preventing campaign delegates from entering the polling stations, and assaulting and arresting them," it said in a statement. Egyptian Prime Minister Ibrahim Mehleb had even declared Tuesday a public holiday "in compliance to citizens' wishes," state TV reported. The decision was thought to be a move to increase turnout. Human Rights Watch said Egypt's 10-month-long crackdown on the opposition undermined the fairness of the presidential elections. "The mass arrests of thousands of political dissidents, whether Islamist or secular, has all but shut down the political arena and stripped these elections of real meaning," the group's Middle East director, Sarah Leah Whitson, said in a statement Wednesday. The election was called because President Mohamed Morsy was removed from power in July in a popular military coup. Al-Sisi, who was army chief at the time, stepped down from his military post this year to run for president.

A member of the editorial board of The Nation, he is author of 18 books and has been a visiting professor at many universities. He served 18 years in the California legislature. Hayden was a founder of the Students for a Democratic Society, and the principal author, in 1962, of the group's manifesto, the Port Huron Statement. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Experience "The Sixties" on CNN starting Thursday, May 29, at 9 p.m. ET. (CNN) -- Shortly before he was murdered, Robert Kennedy was underlining this passage from Ralph Waldo Emerson: "When you have chosen your part, abide by it, and do not try to weakly reconcile yourself with the world. ... Adhere to your own act, and congratulate yourself if you have done something strange and extravagant, and broken the monotony of a decorous age."  These were the questions we all asked ourselves in the tumult of the 1960s: Whether to "weakly reconcile" to the status quo of our parents' world, or break the monotony by actions that might seem "strange and extravagant." Like sitting quietly at a Greensboro lunch counter while frothing racists pushed cigarettes into unbent necks. Or striking a match to our draft cards when we saw Buddhist monks burning themselves in Vietnam. Or coming out of one closet after another. Or facing baton-wielding troops driving jeeps with barbed wire toward 20-somethings at the 1968 Democratic National Convention I asked such questions in my own life back then. I grew up as a Catholic idealist whose innate curiosity drew me to investigative journalism. As a young man, I hitchhiked from Ann Arbor, Michigan, to Berkeley, California, in 1960 on the trail of the Beat Generation. I was most inspired by those young people of my generation who found a cause worth dying for on the civil rights battlefields of the American South. I interviewed a young Martin Luther King Jr. in 1960 while he picketed the Democratic convention in Los Angeles demanding a civil rights plank. Frankly, I wanted to get a front-page story. He was so patient and logical in answering my questions that it made me consider putting down my pen for a placard. Gradually my journalism became advocacy, my advocacy turned to activism. In 1962, I drafted the manifesto of the Students for a Democratic Society, or SDS, known as the Port Huron Statement, defining young people as agents of social change and calling for participatory democracy. I was enlisted as a Freedom Rider in Georgia, then became a door-knocking community organizer in the slums of Newark, New Jersey, and for 10 years an angry opponent of the Vietnam War. In eight years, I was transformed from being a student editor advocating for the Peace Corps to a dangerous menace in the mind of the FBI. The government responded to protests such as mine with accusations of terrorism and prosecution for conspiracy. As the repression grew, so did the length of my hair and my sympathies toward revolution. Similar to a natural birth, the birth of the '60s contained the joyous power of creation. And like all births, there was blood and danger. As Albert Camus wrote in "The Wager of Our Generation": "Yes, there was the sun and poverty. ... Next the war and resistance. And, as a result, the temptation of hatred. Seeing beloved friends and relatives killed is not a schooling in generosity. The temptation of hatred had to be overcome. And I did so."  This was a social revolution led by middle-class students but propelled by "the wretched of the Earth" in places such as Cuba, Vietnam, Belfast, Selma and Oakland. The rising started without a press release and little press notice. Allen Ginsberg read "Howl" at a poetry reading in San Francisco because he, along with Jack Kerouac and now-famous others, were having trouble getting poetry published. Neither was there any significant coverage of the February 1, 1960, sit-in in Greensboro, North Carolina. The four students at the Woolworth's counter had "no plan whatever." The student civil rights movement simply announced itself. Our elders' most common response to our actions was repression and force. "Howl" and its City Lights publisher Lawrence Ferlinghetti were prosecuted for obscenity in 1957. The FBI infested the campuses with thousands of agents searching for secret communists -- or, it turned out, gays, lesbians, philandering professors and alcoholics among the Berkeley faculty. The white-collar Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission worked with the hooded Ku Klux Klan to terrorize people wanting to vote. Despite these shocks and jolts, the first generation of activists in the 1960s stayed largely true to the hope that our elders were somehow mistaken, that the institutions could be reformed from within with just one more push. That hopeful pragmatism renewed itself with each new wave of protest, for example through the "Clean for Gene" volunteers tramping through the New Hampshire snow for moderate anti-war candidate Sen. Eugene McCarthy in 1968. But a deeper disillusionment sank in with each assassination of an elected leader, each photo of a napalmed Vietnamese child, each body dredged from Southern swamps and bayous. The "temptation of hatred" predicted by Camus seeped in with Vietnam. The first U.S. aircraft bombed North Vietnam in August 1964, even as some of us were burying the three civil rights workers killed in Mississippi. A few months later, after the SDS supported Lyndon Johnson because he promised to send no "young American boys" to Southeast Asia, the President did just that. More than 100,000 were sent into combat that first year. The Vietnam draft got young Americans' attention like nothing before. White students in the North sensed in that moment what it was like to be a black student in the South. And it must not be forgotten today, when lying politicians are taken for granted, that this was the first time a young generation elected a president who lied about sending its own brothers to their deaths after promising not to. If innocence wasn't dead already, its headstone now read: "Died in Vietnam, 1965." It was perhaps only accidental that the CIA began covertly distributing LSD in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco the same month that those ground troops were shipped off to Vietnam. A mistake gone out of control, it later said. "Mistake" would become the designation for one dysfunctional disaster after another, Vietnam being the greatest. There were no apologies. The question remains: Why did so many 20-year-old students recognize that Vietnam was a mistake from the beginning -- from the first campus teach-ins of March 1965 -- while our liberal and conservative elders were so certain that it was a necessary, winnable and affordable war against communism? It was certainly not because the peaceniks and beatniks and women's libbers were connected to the Communist Party. Even the CIA rejected that Cold War reasoning in an exhaustive confidential 1968 report to the President.  We protested because we went through a collective near-death experience when our government and Moscow came close to nuclear war over Cuba in 1962. Like Cuba, we learned that Vietnam was a proxy in the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union. We instinctively rejected the notion that the world could be divided into two superpower camps. We protested because of our civil rights experience in the South, where a kind of Third World land reform movement was taking place: Those sharecroppers in the Mississippi Delta looked awfully like the Vietnamese rice farmers in the Mekong Delta, inspiring our global solidarity. Muhammad Ali drew a compelling conclusion: "No Viet Cong ever called me nigger." Resistance to authority grew in the streets by 1966, based more on existentialism than ideology. For those of draft age, the only choices were to serve in a dubious war, take exile in Canada or risk an indefinite prison term. An underground grew up outside the law, including dissidents from draft evaders to Black Panthers on the run, priests and nuns, marijuana offenders and revolutionary saboteurs. The police and FBI caught few of them, and juries refused to rubber-stamp conspiracy charges in the cases of the Chicago Eight, the Catonsville Nine -- Catholics, including priests Daniel and Philip Berrigan, charged after they burned several hundred draft files -- and many more. On its side, the state in the late '60s deployed 1,500 federal Army intelligence officers to surveil 100,000 Americans; another 2,000 FBI agents were dispatched to disrupt legal organizations and "neutralize" protest leaders, myself included. In 1969 alone, I was grazed by death three times. First, my closest friend and co-author of the Port Huron Statement, Richard Flacks, was assaulted at his university desk in Chicago with a claw hammer and left for dead (he lived on). Second, Bay Area police used live ammunition without announcement in quelling the Berkeley People's Park protests; I watched as they killed a young man named James Rector and permanently blinded his friend Alan Blanchard as they sat on a rooftop. Third, during the Chicago conspiracy trial, the police shot and killed two Black Panthers in their sleep; one of them, Fred Hampton, had attended the trial daily as a liaison to Panther leader Bobby Seale. Using available data, one can chart a history of the '60s in a rising line, starting from peaceful protest, 1959-64, then a sharply ascending trajectory toward violence (bombings, police-Panther shootouts, Weather Underground, Kent State, etc.) until 1975, when the line flattens out once again (end of the Vietnam War, fall of Richard Nixon). That line illustrates the truth of John F. Kennedy's maxim that "those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable." There came a time in the '70s when the sun surprisingly broke through the darkest storms. Public opinion -- our parents' opinion -- began to loosen and shift. As late as 1969, the Gallup survey showed that 82% of our parents wanted student protesters expelled. Estranged from my own ex-Marine father for a decade, I learned later that he started shouting at the television that Nixon was a liar. Soon the Democratic Party opened its doors to dissenters. Voting rights were implemented in the South. Jimmy Carter gave amnesty to deserters. Charges were dropped against Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony Russo, who leaked the Pentagon Papers. In addition to the Watergate hearings, Congress woke up and held the first hearings into CIA and FBI law-breaking. The first -- and still strongest -- environmental laws were passed. The Supreme Court upheld Roe v. Wade, affecting millions of our generation, participation or voting rights were expanded to more of the excluded, to farmworkers, the disabled, the 18-year-olds. Vietnam vets mostly reconciled with Vietnam resisters around what we had in common: We had all been lied to. I entered the mainstream and was elected to serve in the California legislature for two decades despite Republican efforts to expel me. I teach at colleges today, where the students don't know me, unless their parents clue them in. The '60s ended not because we "grew up," or because we were effectively repressed, but because we won most of the crucial battles that had mobilized so many for so long. When the movement tides receded, most of us quietly re-entered everyday life in a culture we had changed irreversibly. Despite many premature requiems for the '60s, the decade continues to live as legacy. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.  
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/world/asia/south-korea-deadly-fire/index.html	world	Fire at South Korean hospital for elderly kills 21 - CNN.com	2014/05/27	Tuesday May 27 07:29:36 EDT 2014	Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- A fire broke out at a South Korean hospital for the elderly early Wednesday, killing 21 people -- most of them patients in their 70s and 80s who had difficulty walking. Police said that after examining video footage, they had detained a patient suffering from dementia whom they suspect of starting the blaze in the southern county of Jangseong. The man, who is in his early 80s and was identified only by his surname of Kim, denies causing the fire, said Roh Gyu-ho, the head of Jangseong Police Station. The fire started shortly after midnight in an annex building of the hospital where scores of patients in fragile states were staying. Many of them were suffering from Alzheimer's disease, complications from strokes or other chronic diseases, the national news agency Yonhap reported, citing police and fire officials. Although the fire was put out quickly, many of the victims, unable to move around easily, were believed to have been killed by asphyxiation from toxic fumes that filled the second floor of the two-story building. Hospital apology Video from CNN affiliate YTN showed emergency workers treating victims pulled from the building. Twenty patients and a nurse died, the National Emergency Management Agency said, and eight people were injured, six of them seriously. The head of the hospital, Lee Hyong-seok, apologized Wednesday in front of television cameras. Police said they had closed-circuit television footage from the second floor of the annex building that led them to apprehend Kim as the main suspect. He was admitted to the hospital on May 1, Roh said. South Korea was shaken last month by the sinking of the ferry Sewol off the country's southwestern coast, which left more than 300 people dead or missing, most of them high-school students on a field trip. The accident has focused attention on shortcomings in safety standards in South Korea. On Monday, a fire at a bus terminal in Goyang, near Seoul, killed eight people and injured dozens more.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/sport/hidetoshi-nakata-world-cup-japan-football/index.html	iSport	Hidetoshi Nakata: Japan's misunderstood son returns from exile - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 10:26:27 EDT 2014	CNN's Human to Hero series celebrates inspiration and achievement in sport. Click here for videos and features (CNN) -- By the age of just 29, Hidetoshi Nakata was recognized by many as the greatest footballer Japan had ever produced. So why the glum look? "To be honest with you, it was not my dream," Nakata admits, now, to CNN's Human to Hero series, as he reflects on the emotions he was feeling at his third World Cup, in Germany in 2006. The fans, the media, his teammates: no-one managed to get behind the dark designer sunglasses. No-one understood why -- at the end of a hard-fought defeat to reigning champions Brazil, which meant early elimination for Japan -- the usually stoic Nakata lay down on the turf at the Dortmund's Westfalenstadion and wouldn't get up. "It's unforgettable," he says now -- but still offers no more explanation. That night, his face cracked with pain, Nakata wept under the spotlights. Little-known to any of the traveling Japanese fans assembled in the terraces that evening, Nakata -- a player just reaching the height of his powers -- had made a secret decision, six months before, to walk away from it all. Today  When Nakata arrives to talk about World Cups and what he has been doing for the last eight years, he's nattily dressed -- leather jacket, smart slacks, brightly-colored socks -- and even when out on the pitch, he juggles the ball on expensive-looking designer leather pumps. It's not for nothing that he gets described as Asia's answer to David Beckham. Like Beckham, the hairstyles are now more restrained -- the attention-demanding red spikes are long gone -- and like the English superstar, his reputation continues to extend far beyond his home country: both as Japan's most gifted footballing export and an ambassador for Tokyo's fashion industry. It took eight years in the wilderness -- first wandering across the globe on a meandering journey of self-discovery that he estimates covered close to a hundred countries from Tanzania to Turkmenistan -- but Nakata seems to have found himself. "All my life, I played just football. I didn't know what the world was like outside of football," he explains. "I wanted to know what's happening now in the world, and what I could do for the world." In his time away, Nakata -- now 37 -- appears to have resolved some of the contradictions that once made him the misunderstood man of Asia's rising footballing generation. Like, why did the flamboyantly dressed star -- followed wherever he went by battalions of newly galvanized Japanese soccer fans and screeching admirers, a man who led the first generation of sports stars to share their lives on the internet -- plead so strongly for privacy? And why did a player whose evident love of the game changed perceptions of football in Asia give it all up? Having crossed the world looking for answers, he's finding them closer to home. The one-time Calvin Klein underwear model who, for years, fought to escape his native country's media, has returned home with the aim to visit each of Japan's 47 prefectures, hoping to reconnect with the "real" people he is getting to know. "So many people, so many friends asked me about Japan but I couldn't answer," he says. "In the end, I just realized I didn't know about Japan." Today, fashion takes a back seat -- although he still boasts an unmistakable, if now lower-key style -- and the focus is on the traditional craft of his new job as a sake maker and self-appointed ambassador for Japanese culture abroad. "I have decided to travel in Japan to learn Japanese culture. So, last five years, I have been traveling all the prefectures in Japan, meeting craftsmen, farmers, sake makers and trying to see what are the best hotels and restaurants ... you know, just to tell my friends." Nakata the player  Nakata arrived on the world stage at France '98 -- a willowy, nimble 21-year-old with a peroxide orange crop of hair. He brought with him the Asian Footballer of the Year title (which he would win again the following year) and a defined reputation as a prickly interviewee off the field. His performances for Japanese J-League club Bellmare, and five goals for the national team in qualification for Japan's historic first World Cup, had demonstrated a strong dribbling game and knack for ghosting into the penalty area to score goals. "The first match was against Argentina, which was very difficult -- but at the same time I didn't have anything to lose," he recalls. Flying at full-tilt, making mazing runs through nano-scale gaps in the Argentine defense in the second half, Nakata looked like the rare sort of player who could make the difference even against the world's best opposition. He's a player who "never really had problems playing under pressure," he admits. "I had a lot of motivation and, just like a small kid, it's just having great toys to play with." Journey to Italy Despite losing 1-0 in that match (and succumbing to one-goal losses in both the other group games) the debutants became favorites among neutrals for their classy, ball-down, passing play and desire to take games to vastly more experienced opponents -- typified by Nakata. The next season would see him whisked off to newly-promoted Serie A hopefuls Perugia for $4 million amid reported bids from Manchester United, as he became just the second Japanese footballer to play in Italy's top division. Critics screamed that the Umbrian club had bought a novelty act -- a flash in the pan, buoyed by World Cup excitement. Nakata responded with silence off the field and by blowing away expectations on it -- starting with two goals in a 4-3 loss to champions Juventus on the opening day of the season. "Going to Italy from Japan, obviously, culturally they are totally different, so it was very difficult to learn the Italian language and the lifestyle as well," Nakata says. "But football is always the same -- football is football all over the world -- so I was just concentrating to play football." He scored 10 times in his first season and soon earned a $29.5 million transfer to Fabio Copello's title-challenging Roma side. In the final stretch of the 2000-01 season, he helped Roma come from 2-0 down against a Zinedine Zidane-inspired Juve, scoring a spectacular strike before another long-range attempt led to the equalizer. The result proved crucial as Roma secured just its third league title since forming in 1927, and it earned Nakata another big-money move to Parma -- where he won the Italian Cup the following season, scoring a crucial late away goal in the first leg of the final against Juventus. The joy of football His next two World Cup finals would take him from that highest high to the lowest low. In 2002, Japan and South Korea co-hosted as the tournament came to Asia for the first time. "It was very special because all the population in Japan was really expecting something," Nakata says. "So we had to pass through (the group stages) for sure, even though we lost all three games in the 1998 World Cup." After a draw against Belgium and a 1-0 win over Russia, Japan faced Tunisia in the final group game with all four teams still able to qualify. Heading into the last 15 minutes, the host nation had struggled to break through, but led 1-0 thanks to a reflex strike from substitute midfielder Hiroake Morishima. When fellow replacement Daisuke Ichikawa broke down the right and floated a high ball toward the back post, Nakata, with a sharp header, sent Japan through at the top of the group. "When we came out from the stadium, there were so many people outside the stadium clapping their hands and it seemed like all of Japan were there. And we were so proud of ourselves." Love lost The years leading to the next World Cup would be characterized by full-blown "Nakatamania" -- perhaps apt for a man who was inspired to play the game as a child by the popular Japanese cartoon character "Captain Tsubasa."  Wherever he traveled in Italy, a corps of 20-or-so Japanese reporters followed -- sending back bulletins on his health, his hairstyle, and any hint of a scoop about his private life. The onlookers would have to be dragged away from training sessions and even friendlies against amateur sides would be beamed across the world to be shown live in Japan. Books about him sold in the hundreds of thousands. Nakata had long since stopped talking to the press -- whose tabloid intrusions and tired questions had riled him as a young player in Japan. Instead he talked through his website Nakata.net, which was swamped with 15 million hits a day. All this attention was not missed by clubs. The reports of offers from Manchester United in 1998 had set off the uneasy relationship between Nakata the midfield maestro and -- in the words of the New York Times' Paddy Agnew -- the "one-man tourist attraction and a small merchandising gold mine" he represented to owners. The rumors that year claimed the bids were backed by United shareholder Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB satellite TV company with an eye to opening up deals in east Asia -- without team boss Alex Ferguson's knowledge. For years to follow, any club where Nakata pulled on the jersey could watch tens of thousands of replicas fly out the shop -- mostly to Japanese tourists. Wherever he went, fans and press asked whether talent or commercial interests justified his presence. Why he walked After two and a half seasons at Parma, he went to Bologna and Fiorentina before finally ending up in England in August 2005. However, it was not in Manchester, or London -- Nakata signed for distinctly unfashionable Premier League club Bolton Wanderers on a loan deal. The northern town -- not far from Manchester, but better known as the birthplace of the ice cream wafer sandwich than for its fashion and culture credentials -- represented even more of a culture shock to Nakata. "It was difficult to adapt to," he would later explain in an interview with men's style magazine GQ. Under manager Sam Allardyce, Nakata was pinned uncomfortably into a rigid 4-4-2 system and rarely allowed to wander freely, as he did at his best. After six months, his love for the game faded, and he made his secret pact to retire. Japan again Despite that early end to his top-level career, Nakata has always traveled with a pair of boots in his suitcase. He'll be at the next World Cup -- backed by his sake brand, to show off the Japanese culinary craft and alcohol making he's learned about on his travels -- and he'll often be found playing in charity matches with old footballing friends from Italy and Japan. Now he sees the game as a way to get to know people -- and, perhaps, for people to finally get to know him. "I think football is huge. I think football is the best tool to communicate with other people, to connect the people," he says. "It's beyond the countries, it's beyond languages. "Football is the biggest thing to share, to connect the entire world so ... even outside the stadium, I can play football to connect the people."

Follow the team on Twitter. (CNN) -- As one of Kenya's premier cyclists, David Kinjah crossed the finish line winning medal after medal on several occasions. When he wasn't taking the top spot on the podium, he'd be nurturing local talent, like future Tour de France champion Chris Froome. Today, Kinjah is passing on his expertise through his organization Safari Simbaz, a group of dedicated young people hoping to become cycling heroes in a country known for producing world-class runners. "Kenyan cycling is still at grassroots, and that's a good thing because there's not much politics," Kinjah tells CNN. "We do it at our own village level and we are happy, but the future looks bright. "And in the future there will be the Kenyan runners beating the world, but also possibly the Kenyan cyclists doing well on the world cycling stage."

http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/politics/obama-foreign-policy-takeaways/index.html	politics	3 takeaways from Obama's foreign policy speech - CNN.com	2014/05/28	Wednesday May 28 02:32:11 EDT 2014	Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Wednesday outlined his foreign policy vision and defended his record to date. What caught our experts' ears was as much about what he didn't address as much as what he did. Obama lays out foreign policy challenges Here are their takeaways: 1. Partner in Yemen still has problems: Obama's call for a new $5 billion counter-terrorism fund to "train, build capacity, and facilitate partner countries on the front lines" may find it tough going to achieve quick results. "These resources will give us flexibility to fulfill different missions, including training security forces in Yemen who have gone on the offensive against al Qaeda; supporting a multinational force to keep the peace in Somalia; working with European allies to train a functioning security force and border patrol in Libya; and facilitating French operations in Mali," the President said. But the challenge in Yemen alone may be significant. Some U.S. officials believe the problem there is that neither the Yemeni forces or al Qaeda operatives have fundamentally changed the territory they hold on the ground. Both sides are maneuvering, both attack and counterattack, but even with Yemeni military efforts, the basic power on the ground doesn't shift for either side. The problem with Yemen's military remains its inability to sustain itself in the field for a long period of time. There are additional challenges. In Libya, a training program is running into delays over how to ensure those being trained are not extremists. There is a similar challenge in training Syrian opposition forces. And in Nigeria, the U.S. military is legally banned from working with some Nigerian units because those units have been accused of human rights abuses. -- Barbara Starr, CNN Senior Pentagon Correspondent Transcript: Obama's foreign policy address 2. Looking through the right lens?: The President spoke very little of the three-year civil war in Syria, addressing it primarily as a counter-terrorism challenge. He referenced support for the moderate opposition, a nod to a plan to increase training for rebels now fighting both forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and extremists linked to al Qaeda. But Obama made scant mention of efforts to strengthen the political opposition and glossed over the year-long effort to bring the regime and opposition to the table for peace talks that broke down months ago and now seem dead in the water. Libya and Iraq were also treated mostly as a counter-terrorism challenge. The U.S. helped rid Libya of Moammar Gadhafi, but the country is now in the throes of a political crisis that is driving the current violence, which requires sustained diplomatic engagement. The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq has also seen a lessening of high-level diplomatic attention while sectarian violence is again on the rise. The reduction of the U.S. military footprint must be matched with a redoubling of U.S. diplomatic engagement, and such a vision was lacking in the President's speech by viewing these countries through a terrorism lens. -- Elise Labott, CNN Foreign Policy Reporter Five foreign policy headaches for Obama 3. What about Syria? Syria was going to be the headline today. I think what we got was this partnership fund with other nations that needs to be approved by Congress and we'll look for supporting the moderate opposition on the ground more. Even if that does substantially change the situation down the road, I think the way it comes across here falls a little flat, especially with some of the buildup we've seen leading into it. I think "defensive" is kind of the word here. I think some of what has tainted or dampened the stance that the administration has taken even in the briefing room day-to-day is that they have been pushed into a defensive stance. This was a sweeping speech that kind of covered everything and as well was a chance for the President to list what seemed like every accomplishment of his administration, but it kind of read like a defensive, lawyerly answer to the critics. We thought that's what the President didn't want to do. He did go there. He even mentioned some of the critiques that he's faced. He also had some key phrases like "tough talk generates headlines but war rarely conforms to that kind of mode" and "We may have the best hammer but every one of our problems is not a nail." -- Michelle Kosinski, CNN White House Correspondent
